Deloitte."},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a great professional\nservices firm."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"So we needed to\nrun at that rate,"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"and that meant we had to review\nall

legacy."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"You can't change that,\nbecause if you change it,"},"598":{"dur":0,"text":"you'll break it."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"There will be riots\nin the streets."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"I had that said to\nme several times."},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"We created a way of\nmoving legacy away."},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"It's called the Crown\nHosting

me,"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"that works for us."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"The creation of our own Hotel\nCalifornia for government"},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"IT has meant that we can put\nstuff in, you can put it in,"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"we'll run it, it's nice, it\nwill always be looked after."},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"You just can never check it out."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"So we found that technology was\nmoving faster than government."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"We had to be free to keep up."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"We had to change\nshape, as I said."},"656":{"dur":0,"text":"So keep that in mind."},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you introduce platforms?"},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"How do you introduce common\nservices to an organization"},"661":{"dur":4,"text":"that is a large organization\nfull of tremendously"},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"gifted professional\npeople, but who have always"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"been working in silos?"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the changes we made."},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"First, we had to say\nwhat good looked like."},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"So we wrote down what\ngood looked like."},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"We literally wrote\na manual for CTOs,"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"which we then changed into the\ntechnology code of practice."},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"And this was agreed by everybody\nwho was a technology leader."},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"So we convened everybody,\nmade sure everyone"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"agreed what good looked like."},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"We then agreed some\ndesign principles,"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"because if you're designing\nservices for citizens,"},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"we want to have a\ncommon approach."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"A citizen does not\nlook at the government"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"and think, actually,\nthat's really interesting,"},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"it's 24 different departments."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"A citizen looks at the\ngovernment and goes,"},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"it's the government."},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"It's one thing."},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you're going to have a\ncommon approach to how you deal"},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"with citizens, you need to\nhave common design principles,"},"717":{"dur":4,"text":"again, which are agreed\nand which are shared."},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the things\nwe did to make sure"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"that we could work\nproperly is we realized"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"we were going to be using\nthe internet quite a lot,"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"so we needed to\nhave open standards."},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"And one of the most difficult\nopen standards we had to use"},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"was how do you\nexplain to a citizen"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"that they need to,\nat some points,"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"have a document which they need\nto fill in or change or modify?"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"We had to do that in a way\nthat didn't require people"},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"to sign in and use one\nparticular piece of software."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"So we defined what an\nopen document format"},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"should be for the government."},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"There was enormous\namount of peer review."},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"We did the same\nconsultation process"},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"as you would do for\nopening a new airport"},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"to make sure we could do that."},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"But that brought\nin the capability"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"to have common open standards."},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"And again, just culturally,\nthis held people's views"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"that open standards\nare important."},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"We cut out a lot of friction."},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was the\norganization chart"},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"that I had when I started."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"If any of you can work\nout how to do this bit,"},"778":{"dur":0,"text":"I never got there."},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"I never worked out\nthat bit on the right,"},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"because it was just too complex."},"783":{"dur":0,"text":"So we changed that."},"784":{"dur":0,"text":"We introduced this."},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"This is our organization."},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"This is our primary motivation."},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"Our primary organizing\nthing was a browser."},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you use a browser, these\nthings become really simple."},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"You can identify where you\nhave common services that you"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"You can identify where you\nhave common specific things"},"800":{"dur":4,"text":"like ERP, which just should\nbe done in a similar way."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"And then it allows you to create\nnew, great, digital services,"},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"allows you to create the\nmission IT, the internal IT"},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"to work with people,\ntaking away and abstracting"},"814":{"dur":4,"text":"all of that gumpf which\nis the infrastructure."},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"And using the cloud for\nthat, and declaring the cloud"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"as the primary place for\nthat is the main change"},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"within that space."},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"And we needed to work with\nlots of innovative companies."},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"So we changed the way\nthat we worked with people"},"833":{"dur":5,"text":"We created a new tech\nsector called GovTech."},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"And this GovTech\nsector was about,"},"841":{"dur":5,"text":"how do we bring people in\nto work with the government"},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"and make it easy for them\nto work with the government?"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"Not make it easy for\ngovernment to work with them."},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a really\nimportant difference."},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"And we grew a huge\nnumber of jobs."},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"We drew a huge number\nof innovations."},"859":{"dur":4,"text":"But what happened was this meant\nthat our tech cost less and was"},"864":{"dur":4,"text":"better because we were going\nto companies that specialized"},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"in particular components, rather\nthan going to one big company"},"872":{"dur":4,"text":"and saying, please take it\nall away from me and do it."},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's 1.6 billion sales."},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"55-- 55."},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"I've got a new number."},"881":{"dur":1,"text":"It was 54."},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"55% of that is\nsmall-medium enterprises."},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a way of government\nhelping build the innovation"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"and helping grow the businesses."},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we now feel the UK is\na center of digital excellence"},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"We're the number one\ndigital government according"},"895":{"dur":3,"text":"to the United Nations, and\nwe have started our move"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"because what we've done\nis instead of treating"},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"our technology on the\nleft of that diagram,"},"904":{"dur":3,"text":"we're now doing so much\nmore of it on the right."},"907":{"dur":4,"text":"We're doing so much more using\nthe capability of common tools"},"912":{"dur":1,"text":"so that you can focus\non the things that"},"914":{"dur":1,"text":"are important in\ngovernment, which"},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"is building great services\nfor your citizens."},"918":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, a lot of this\nis down to the use"},"922":{"dur":3,"text":"of one four-letter word, Open."},"925":{"dur":1,"text":"Open helped us change this."},"927":{"dur":1,"text":"Open was our disruptor."},"928":{"dur":1,"text":"If you need to\nconstruct a narrative"},"930":{"dur":4,"text":"to change your\ngovernment, Open works."},"934":{"dur":2,"text":"So four things we\ndid that were open."},"936":{"dur":1,"text":"One, open markets."},"937":{"dur":3,"text":"As you'll see, we had a\nsmall number of
