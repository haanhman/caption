the impact"},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"of complex interventions."},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"So already, you've got a\nproblem actually finding out"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"whether it works or not,\nbefore deciding whether or not"},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"it scales or not."},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"So if to say, you\nhave a situation"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"where you do find\nsomething works"},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"and enough people could\nbe convinced by it,"},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"then you have to consider what\nare the conditions under which"},"300":{"dur":3,"text":"scale or

something\na digital app,"},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"or you can have people-powered\npeer group support"},"322":{"dur":5,"text":"or you could have a community\nbase intervention of some

real\nheterogeneity of things"},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"that you might want\nto scale or spread."},"338":{"dur":4,"text":"Then you have multiple\ncontexts, which"},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"we know some

thing."},"384":{"dur":4,"text":"It's been a hard battle even\npersuading someone to buy it."},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"So there has to be\na demand, and that"},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"requires thinking about it."},"391":{"dur":4,"text":"It requires mobilisation, it\nrequires a whole set of skills."},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"So already, you can\nsee that there's"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"a great deal of complexity here."},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"And us talking about\nscaling and innovation"},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"is almost talking\nabout simplicity"},"406":{"dur":4,"text":"when actually, it's a very\nmultiple and complex set"},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"of issues."},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"Having said that, you might sort\nof throw up your hands and say,"},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"this is all far too complicated."},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"But actually, I think\nthere are ways forward."},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think one way forward\nis to really examine"},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"what are the types\nof innovations"},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"that we know have spread?"},"429":{"dur":4,"text":"For example, my foundation funds\na whole range of innovations"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"and we also try to spread them."},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"There are some\nthings that we funded"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"and they've spread\nby themselves."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"And we don't

spread."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"We funded something\ncalled Prompt,"},"449":{"dur":4,"text":"which is a multidisciplinary\ntraining course for people"},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"in maternity units\nwith patients,"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"and as a result\nperinatal morbidity"},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"and mortality has plummeted."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"That has spread not\njust throughout the

that\nwhich seem simple, but haven't"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"spread."},"475":{"dur":5,"text":"So I think we\nunderstand a lot more"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"that conditions\nand context matter."},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"We understand some\nof the factors"},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"that make those conditions\nmore forgivable for spread."},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"But what we really need\nto do is much more careful"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"thinking about what\nkinds of animals"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"we're talking about\nhere, and can we"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"be much more\nsystematic in learning"},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"far more about the conditions\nfor scale than we have to date."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"So a final points\nis, you might say,"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"all this is far too complicated."},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"We're going to have\n10 years of research."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"Meantime, we've got\na burning house."},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"How are we going\nto step forward?"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"I think there are two\nthings to consider here."},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"The first thing is\nthere is the

2021."},"530":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think that there needs\nto be a particular set of ways"},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"forward, which is to\nbasically try to push big bets"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"where

money."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"Therefore, let's try to do\nour best on a limited set."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"But then there's\nthe bigger issue,"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"which I think people here\nare more interested in,"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"which is what is the\nmain flow of development"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"of innovation in the long run?"},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"And how to encourage that in\nall its multi-faceted forms."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"And to not hold that up, not\nbecause we have the evidence"},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"to say it's the\nright thing to do,"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"but because it is the right\nthing to do to empower people"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"to create value."},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"So in a sense, what\nI'm trying to say"},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"is that there are\ntwo highways here."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"One highway which is\nplural, and to say we"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"want to move forward on\nthe right

evidence\nbecause what we're trying to do"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"is too complicated."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"But in the short term, we\nare interested in trying"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"to make some, at least as\nfar as the NHS is concerned,"},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"some short-run changes that\nwill make some productivity"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"changes, efficiency\nchanges, changes in

the latter"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"to the former."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the former is more\nimportant and more pleural"},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"and more uncertain."},"622":{"dur":0,"text":"Thanks, Jennifer."},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"That was a very comprehensive\noverview of this complex issue."},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"Before I just want to\nask for a

push\nthings down on people"},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"very often might get\nsome short term change,"},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's very hard to sustain."},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think it's only when\nwe get the proposition"},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"across in a way, that\nreally connects with what"},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"matters to people and values."},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"And it really works."},"848":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's interesting, because\nI advise informally quite a lot"},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"people that are\ninnovators in-house,"},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"and we
