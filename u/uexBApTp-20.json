worked\nin film for 10 years,"},"29":{"dur":2,"text":"formerly as a producer, and\nthen laterally in distribution."},"32":{"dur":4,"text":"And the general release windows\naround film has just changed,"},"36":{"dur":0,"text":"utterly dramatically."},"37":{"dur":1,"text":"So, what you can\nsee, at the top,"},"39":{"dur":2,"text":"is, it used to be a very linear,\nvery controlled, very long"},"41":{"dur":0,"text":"process."},"42":{"dur":1,"text":"There were very\ndistinct windows."},"43":{"dur":1,"text":"And what's now\nhappening is there's"},"45":{"dur":1,"text":"a complete

things to\npoint is that we've now"},"56":{"dur":1,"text":"got premium digital windows."},"57":{"dur":2,"text":"So ahead of theatrical\nrelease-- which,"},"60":{"dur":4,"text":"for the history of filmmaking,\nhas been the premium mechanism"},"64":{"dur":3,"text":"of release-- we've now got\ndigital windows, ahead of that."},"68":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we've got a\nvery fractured piece,"},"69":{"dur":3,"text":"where VOD can come--\ntraditional VOD can"},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"come alongside theatrical,\nor in the kind of long tail."},"77":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, again, just\nvery headline stuff, here."},"80":{"dur":1,"text":"Basically, what we're\nseeing with film"},"82":{"dur":1,"text":"is what happened\nwith music, which"},"84":{"dur":4,"text":"is that music was fixated on the\nphysical product-- on the disc."},"88":{"dur":4,"text":"And film is remaining fixated\non theatrical release,"},"92":{"dur":1,"text":"and also on DVD."},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, if you look\nat the 2010 figure,"},"96":{"dur":4,"text":"DVD used to, by such a\nlong way, be the main piece"},"100":{"dur":1,"text":"of the revenue pie, as it were."},"102":{"dur":1,"text":"And, in just over\n10 years, we're"},"103":{"dur":1,"text":"seeing how dramatically\nthat is changing."},"105":{"dur":2,"text":"And, again, if you look\nat the trends-- you know,"},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"everything green is\ndigital; everything red"},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"is a physical product."},"113":{"dur":2,"text":"So then, again, just some,\nagain, really headline stuff."},"115":{"dur":1,"text":"So, film is a big market."},"118":{"dur":2,"text":"VOD is one of the\nfastest-growing sectors."},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"And the critical\nthing, as I mentioned,"},"123":{"dur":2,"text":"is how predominantly\nVOD is competing, now,"},"125":{"dur":1,"text":"with theatrical."},"127":{"dur":4,"text":"And, by 2017-- which is really,\nreally soon-- digital revenue"},"131":{"dur":1,"text":"will overtake theatrical\nfor the first time."},"133":{"dur":3,"text":"And, just like music, we're\nseeing that film is

engagement."},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"And, arguably, crowdfunding\nis one of the best evidences"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"of people willing to get\ninvolved with film super early."},"156":{"dur":1,"text":"So."},"157":{"dur":1,"text":"I guess, what's the problem?"},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"So Debs, from Film London,\nshould be here, to say,"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"but her bathroom is leaking\ninto her living room."},"163":{"dur":1,"text":"So she's not here."},"165":{"dur":0,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"But she would talk, very\npassionately, about this."},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"And, basically, the key\nthing to pull out, here,"},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"is that 6% of all\nfilms made account"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"for 80% of global revenue."},"175":{"dur":3,"text":"In the UK, 20 films take\nhalf the box office."},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, there are\nseveral things to say."},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"One is, possibly, that\ntoo much film gets made."},"183":{"dur":3,"text":"But the other is about\naccess to audiences."},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"And, again,\ntraditionally, that access"},"190":{"dur":3,"text":"has been held by the studios--\ntheatrical distributors."},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"And the key thing is this,\nwhich is that the Hollywood"},"198":{"dur":3,"text":"system spends $4 billion a\nyear on marketing, alone."},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"So $0.50 on every dollar\ngoes for marketing."},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"And, if any of you have been\ninvolved with independent film,"},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll know that about\nzero pence in every pound"},"208":{"dur":1,"text":"goes on marketing."},"210":{"dur":1,"text":"Independent filmmakers\nmake their film"},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"and think that is\ntheir job, done."},"213":{"dur":1,"text":"And, in some ways, it is."},"214":{"dur":1,"text":"But this is a business."},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"They've got to think\nbetter about how"},"217":{"dur":1,"text":"they engage with the market."},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is our response,\nat We Are Colony."},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're focused on\nearly and exclusive"},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"behind the scenes\naccess to film."},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"So, again, I mean, we\nlooked at the marketplace,"},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is what we saw."},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"So, basically, the horizontal\naxis is about time."},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"So, early access [INAUDIBLE]\ntraditional windows."},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"And the vertical\nis about content."},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we saw was that there\nare some really big players,"},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"in this space."},"243":{"dur":1,"text":"Netflix, for example."},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"But everyone is focused,\npredominantly, on the film,"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"and on, kind of,\ntraditional windows."},"249":{"dur":1,"text":"And what we see-- if\nyou see us, at the top,"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"there-- is that we see that we\ncould be a kind of end to end,"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"where we're the place\nfor early access,"},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"and then the place to\nmonetise the long tail."},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're essentially\na marketplace."},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"We have a B2B and a B2C element."},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"So, for content owners--\nfilmmakers, distributors,"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"and, potentially, in time,\nbigger content players--"},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"we want to be the\nplace to launch"},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"their film into the market and\nstart to build a following."},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"Again, critically\nanswering this piece"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"about marketing and\naudience engagement."},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"And, for consumers, we\nwant to be the place"},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"to get early and exclusive\naccess to films that they love."},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"So there are several elements\nto what we have been building."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"So I guess the\nproduct-- I'm going"},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"to do you a very quick\ndemo, in a second."},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"But we're calling the\nproducts a \"companion.\""},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"The very easiest\nway to think of it"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"is it's like a DVD\nspecial edition."},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're doing that, for VOD."},"301":{"dur":4,"text":"So we bundle a film with a whole\nhost of nontraditional content."},"306":{"dur":3,"text":"So trailers, deleted\/extended\nscenes, production diaries,"},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"interviews with cast\nand crew, et cetera."},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"But also some\nnontraditional assets."},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"So, things like script,\nstoryboards, posters,"},"317":{"dur":4,"text":"concept art, press,\net cetera, et cetera."},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"And the critical\nthing, here, is that we"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"want to look to see what\nhappens when we prerelease some"},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"of that content, ahead of\nthe film's general release."},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"Traditionally, all that\ncontent's been held back,"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's been monetised\nafter general release."},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"We're interested\nto see what it can"},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"do about-- in terms of audience\nengagement and marketing--"},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"but also, potentially, driving\npresales on the film, itself."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"So we give access to\nthat additional content."},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"We give access to films."},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"We're interested in exploring\nthe different windows."},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"So, as I showed you,\nat the very beginning,"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"where we can fit in\nthat window of release."},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"And, in time, we think that We\nAre Colony could provide access"},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"to a community of\nlike-minded fans,"},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"although not in the duration\nof the Nesta project."},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"So I chickened out of doing\na live demo, so (LAUGHING)"},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"I I'm just going to\nshow you some, uh--"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"It works; I promise."},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"So we launched in June,\nas an invite-only beta."},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is what you'll see,\nif you go to wearecolony.com."},"376":{"dur":4,"text":"So we're asking people to sign\nup for an invite, or sign in."},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"When you sign in, this\nis what you'll see."},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is the landing page."},"385":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a combination of editorial\nrecommendation and then"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"the catalogue."},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"As you'll see, at the\nbottom of the screen, there,"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"we're also really aware that\nwe have to very quickly show"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"the audience that we're not\nanother Netflix type-- not"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"just another kind of\nNetflix-type platform."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're disaggregating some\nof the additional content"},"403":{"dur":0,"text":"and previewing it."},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"That's something we'll\nbe playing around with."},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"I should talk a little\nbit about Film London."},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, Film London's\ninvolvement, here,"},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"is, they want to be\nleading the sector,"},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"in exploring new models."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"And, critically, trying to\nanswer that problem about film"},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"and revenue generation."},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, that piece\nabout 20 films"},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"take half the\nBritish box office."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"The other thing to say is\nthat 3% of British films"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"make a profit."},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"Only 3%."},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's, kind of, Film\nLondon's piece in this-- is,"},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"how do we try and break that?"},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"And they see digital models\nas an opportunity to do that."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"So, within the\nNesta pilot, we are"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"looking at between\nsix and eight titles."},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"They're quite disparate."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're trying to\ndrill down into what"},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"makes them of interest to\naudiences, at every level."},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're looking at things like,\nwhat is the power of talent?"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"We're looking at\ndifferent genres."},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"We're looking at short film."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"We're looking at films that\nhave an offline angle--"},"461":{"dur":4,"text":"like a big event-- and trying\nto draw some conclusions"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"or recommendations\nfor the sector."},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"So, when you click\ninto a companion,"},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"from the landing page,\nyou go into the product."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"So, again, this is a\nkind of recent iteration."},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"We've really pared\nback our branding,"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"because, if an audience\ncomes wanting this title,"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"we want to give it to\nthem, straight off."},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Explore\" is our\nmain content view."},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's the film, itself."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"And then it differs,\nwith every title,"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"but things like-- this film\nhas a 40-minute making-of"},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"documentary, interviews\nwith cast and crew."},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"If you go down the page, we\nthen have nine deleted scenes"},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"that haven't been\nreleased, anywhere else."},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"You can also see the\nhover state, there."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"So where it says \"deleted\nscene-- Roddy and Tom,\""},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"that's the hover state."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"If you click on any of these\nthumbnails, it opens in Page."},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"You can watch in Page\nor go full-screen."},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"And then albums of stills."},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, what we call \"Extra.\""},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"So, again, this is the\nnontraditional stuff,"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"like script, storyboards,\nposters, concept art."},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"We've got costume books."},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"A whole host of stuff."},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"And, I guess, what\nwe're doing, here,"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"is appealing to fans of\na very particular talent."},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"So we have a couple of\nBenedict Cumberbatch films."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm telling you, right now, that\nhis fans will consume anything"},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"--he is in."},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"Or we're going after genre fans."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"So, fans of thriller,\nsci-fi, horror, docs."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"Or we're going after more\nsort of casual film fans"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"that just want an\ninsight into process."},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, the other thing,\nI guess, is recommendations."},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the challenges\nwe have is,"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"if we can bring an audience\nto a particular talent,"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"how do we propel them\nacross other titles"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"and get them to stay\nwith the platform?"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"So we have a very, very early\neditorial-driven recommendation"},"564":{"dur":0,"text":"engine."},"567":{"dur":0,"text":"And then About."},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is a little\nbit like IMDB."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"So things like quotes,\nsynopsis, plot summaries."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"All those classifications\ndrive internal search, 'cause,"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"as I say, it's all\nabout propelling people"},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"through the content."},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"And then things like cast and\ncrew roles, awards, festivals,"},"581":{"dur":0,"text":"and partners."},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"So that is the briefest\nlook at the product."},"588":{"dur":0,"text":"So we launched in June."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"I just wanted to share some\nincredibly early analytics"},"591":{"dur":0,"text":"with you."},"592":{"dur":6,"text":"So the first thing would be, I\nguess, we're a global platform."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"And that, I think, is\nprobably unusual, among some"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"of the Nesta projects,\nbut also, certainly,"},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"unusual for VOD platforms."},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"Film has, traditionally,\nbeen a kind"},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"of very territorial,\nnationalistic licencing model."},"610":{"dur":4,"text":"And being a global platform\nis such a challenge for us,"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of trying to talk\nwith traditional distributors"},"617":{"dur":0,"text":"and sales agents."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think that is the\nfuture of digital rights."},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"So the result has\nbeen that we've"},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"had visitors from 132 countries."},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"And I should point\nout that we're yet"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"to really press the button on\nany kind of real marketing."},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"So this has all been\ndriven by social."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"And, again, it just shows the\nkind of virality, I guess,"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"of some of the titles and\ntalents we're working with."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, in terms of what\nwe call \"account holders,\""},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"those people who've come,\nsigned up for a beta,"},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"and then come back."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"The kind of peaks,\nhere, are absolutely"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"tied to when we\nlaunch new films."},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"So this brings me to the\nother major challenge we have,"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"and one that Debs would be\nable to talk very eloquently"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"about, which is converting\ntitles to work with us,"},"658":{"dur":0,"text":"on the platform."},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, there is\na real opportunity"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"for independent\nfilmmakers to monetise"},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"their film-direct audiences."},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"But filmmakers are\nincredibly risk-averse."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"They are frightened,\npractically, to do anything."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"And I speak as a\nformer filmmaker,"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're frightened that\nyou make a wrong decision,"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"and you give rights away that\nprevents a big-- you know,"},"679":{"dur":0,"text":"some big deal."},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"And the thing that Debs\nis very frustrated by"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"is just the kind of waiting."},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, there are titles\nthat we were talking"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"to, a year ago, that\nare still-- haven't"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"decided what they're doing."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"And, arguably, they lose\nthe value in their product"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"by just sitting on\nit-- kind of waiting"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"to make the right decision."},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"And I would argue that there's\nso much flux, in film, there"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"is no right decision,\nin the moment."},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just about\ntrying new models."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"So one of the biggest\nchallenges, for us,"},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"is the kind of\nacquisition funnel"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"and converting filmmakers\nto work with us."},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"I guess a nice\nthing to say, here,"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"is that our kind of user\nengagement is very good."},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"Our page numbers is quite deep."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"We're seeing between 5 and\n10% of our usership online,"},"725":{"dur":0,"text":"every day."},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"And the time onsite\nis really good."},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"So, seven minutes sounds\nshort, for a VOD platform,"},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"but Netflix's time on\nsite is one minute 20."},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"And our closest competitor,\nFandor, is three minutes."},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"So we've got a, kind of,\nreally engaged early user base."},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, to make\nthis work, we do not"},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"have the marketing budgets of\nsome of our big competitors."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"So, to make this work, we\nhave to really out-compete"},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"in the social spaces."},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, this is,\nagain, really early,"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"first three months stuff."},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"But it shows that we're\ndoing a good job of social"},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"and referral, as well."},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"So we create \"influencer\nstrategies\"--"},"760":{"dur":0,"text":"what we call them."},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"So we look at a\ntitle and work out"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"how to reach that audience base."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's often through\npartner sites, fan sites,"},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"publications, et cetera."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"And I guess I\nwanted to show this."},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"So we had our Twitter and\nour Facebook strategy nailed."},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"And then Tumblr\ncame along, and it's"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"delivering half of our traffic."},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't know\nTumblr, personally."},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's been a bit of a\nlearning curve, for us."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"The interesting thing to say\nwould be that, in three months,"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"we've probably done\n20 Tumblr posts."},"789":{"dur":0,"text":"That's it."},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's delivering\nhalf of our traffic."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's our user\nbase, talking for us."},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we've had\na kind of early--"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"We've had to respond, quite\nquickly, to some piracy."},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"Piracy, on Tumblr, tends\nto be stills-driven,"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"and all our stills\nare watermarked."},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"Our view is, if they are\nattributing to source,"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"that we kind of don't care."},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"But that's something\nthat we have"},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"to work out, as we start to\nwork with bigger content owners."},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, I guess, to talk a\nlittle bit about-- the premise"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"of this entire project\nis that audiences"},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"are interested in the\nadditional content"},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"that they traditionally\nwere getting through DVDs."},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"But now, nobody's creating DVDs,\nso they're not getting them,"},"829":{"dur":0,"text":"anymore."},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's bornes\nout by the fact"},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"that, in our top 10 assets,\nnot a single feature film"},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"registers, there."},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"And, again-- so, this is,\nactually, just the last month."},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is really\nearly

back?"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"How do we convert\nthem, across titles?"},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"And, critically, how\ndo we get the industry"},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"to feel like this about\nus, and
