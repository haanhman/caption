As we say we've got\na light chopped strand mat, we're using a"},"514":{"dur":5,"text":"225 gram here.

The light chopped strand provides"},"567":{"dur":5,"text":"reinforcement at this early stage but because\nits a light mat it's very easy to get it down"},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"into the contours of a mould which ensures\nthat you're not going to have any voids between"},"577":{"dur":7,"text":"the gel coat and the main tooling reinforcement\nand the coupling coat itself chemically is"},"584":{"dur":5,"text":"designed to act as an interface between this\nvinylester tooling gel coat and the tooling"},"589":{"dur":7,"text":"resin itself.

So"},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"we just put in a large bead of wax and then\nsmooth it out in just the way we've been doing"},"844":{"dur":4,"text":"elsewhere. So if we just take a quick tour\nnow of what we've done before we put the gel"},"849":{"dur":7,"text":"coat on. We've got release tape over all of\nthe catch mechanisms we've got any interior"},"857":{"dur":5,"text":"holes we've filled with release tape and again\nwe've cut those to be nice and neat. On these"},"863":{"dur":6,"text":"areas where we've got a bit of undercut on\nthe actual steel of the bonnet we've completely"},"869":{"dur":5,"text":"filled that with filleting wax as we did with\nthis awkward corner. And you can also see"},"874":{"dur":5,"text":"how we finished that middle edge. Okay so\nwe've just mixed up a new batch of the tooling"},"880":{"dur":5,"text":"gel coat and we're just going to apply this\nall the way over the surface of the inside"},"885":{"dur":6,"text":"of this mould just like we did on the top\nmould.

Just like before we'll be applying"},"929":{"dur":7,"text":"all of the reinforcement and the tooling resin\nin one session. We'll be using four layers"},"937":{"dur":6,"text":"of the 450 gram chopped strand mat.

With"},"990":{"dur":4,"text":"the mould fully trimmed it's now time to some\nextent for the moment of truth and what we're"},"994":{"dur":4,"text":"going to do is separate the upper and lowers\nmoulds.

So that's our upper bonnet moulding"},"1038":{"dur":7,"text":"done now and it's just time to remove the\nbonnet itself from this lower tool. We'll"},"1052":{"dur":4,"text":"be looking at doing this underside moulding\nfirst because it's actually slightly more"},"1057":{"dur":3,"text":"complicated than the upper moulding.
