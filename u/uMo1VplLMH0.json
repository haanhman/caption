marketing,"},"15":{"dur":2,"text":"we've got payment\nplatforms, like seriously,"},"17":{"dur":1,"text":"this stuff just gets very overwhelming"},"19":{"dur":1,"text":"when you're first starting out."},"21":{"dur":2,"text":"There is a lot to think\nabout, and there's all kinds"},"23":{"dur":1,"text":"of advice out there\ntelling you what to do."},"25":{"dur":1,"text":"So the first thing I'm gonna say"},"26":{"dur":2,"text":"is there is no single one way\nof doing any of this stuff."},"29":{"dur":2,"text":"There are multiple combinations, there are"},"31":{"dur":2,"text":"a billion different types\nof platforms out there."},"33":{"dur":2,"text":"Do go and research them all,\ndo the free trials of them all,"},"36":{"dur":1,"text":"find the ones that work best for you."},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"So, with that aside, what I'm\ngonna share with you today"},"41":{"dur":2,"text":"is just some of the methods that I use"},"43":{"dur":2,"text":"and that works for me as an edupreneur,"},"45":{"dur":2,"text":"someone who sells\ninformation based products."},"47":{"dur":3,"text":"So that I can give you just\na bigger picture, really,"},"50":{"dur":1,"text":"of how this all fits together."},"52":{"dur":2,"text":"So that once you see this bigger picture,"},"55":{"dur":1,"text":"hopefully now it will\nmake a bit more sense."},"56":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm also gonna show you\njust a couple of the tools"},"58":{"dur":2,"text":"and pieces of software that\nI use, just explain them"},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"so that you go into\nthis a little bit

me"},"69":{"dur":1,"text":"one of the blue pens or something,"},"71":{"dur":2,"text":"I think the blue one works better."},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"(coughs) So, (coughs) when\nyou're running an online business"},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"guys, obviously the first\nthing to do, thank you,"},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"is to think about what are\nthe products and services"},"81":{"dur":1,"text":"that you actually have."},"82":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I'm gonna talk to edupreneurs\nhere, so I'm gonna assume"},"85":{"dur":4,"text":"that you have some kind of\neducational or information type"},"89":{"dur":3,"text":"products to sell,\nparticularly online courses."},"93":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I don't know how well you can see this"},"95":{"dur":3,"text":"so I'm going to explain,\nwhat we have in the middle,"},"98":{"dur":3,"text":"if you're selling online\ncourses, is your online school."},"101":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the heart of your\neducation based business."},"105":{"dur":2,"text":"This is where your\ncourses and your content"},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"are going to live, this is\nwhere the discussions happen,"},"109":{"dur":3,"text":"where the community is built,\nthis is where you really"},"113":{"dur":3,"text":"build in that place, that hub, for all"},"116":{"dur":1,"text":"of your content to live."},"118":{"dur":3,"text":"So, ultimately, we want all of\nour students to end up there."},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"However, what we don't want\nto do is make all of our"},"124":{"dur":3,"text":"marketing directly go\nto our online school."},"127":{"dur":3,"text":"Why, because if we're using\nan external piece of software"},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"or platform, well what\nhappens if that disappears"},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"or crashes or the business goes under,"},"135":{"dur":3,"text":"you've got marketing out to\nthe world that's pinpointing"},"138":{"dur":2,"text":"to the URL of your school."},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"So what you want to be doing\nfor your own marketing purposes"},"143":{"dur":3,"text":"is every time you are marketing\nyou want to be sending"},"146":{"dur":4,"text":"people to your website,\nbecause on your website"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"you have more than just\nyour online courses, right?"},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"You might have other\nproducts and services,"},"155":{"dur":2,"text":"you might be a

that"},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"people can buy, so you\nreally want people going"},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"to that website so that you\ncan capture their information,"},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"perhaps if you have\ntracking pixels on the site,"},"171":{"dur":3,"text":"that's another conversation,\nmaybe you have lead magnets"},"174":{"dur":1,"text":"that pop up on your\nwebsite and give people"},"176":{"dur":2,"text":"the opportunity to exchange\ntheir email address"},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"for your gifts or your\nspecial offers that you have"},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"available, or indeed, just\nsimply the whole purpose"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"of them browsing on that\nsite means that they may see"},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"things that they didn't\nknow that you offered"},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"and can turn into customers"},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"just because you sent them there."},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"So your website is always\nwhere you want to be sending"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"people in the first instance, okay?"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"So, whether you are doing\nblogs, whether you have"},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"little image tip cards out\nthere, if you're doing podcasts,"},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"if you're doing speaking,\nif you're just starting out,"},"205":{"dur":1,"text":"always send people to your website."},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, WordPress is a\nfantastic platform to use"},"210":{"dur":1,"text":"for building your website."},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"It's completely free\nand a lot of the plugins"},"214":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can add to customize your website"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"and really make it your\nown are also free, as well."},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"So, building a WordPress\nwebsite is very straightforward,"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"it's a lot easier than people think."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"You can do it yourself,\nthere's a lot of web developers"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"out there that can do great work for you,"},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"but I highly encourage\nyou to actually learn"},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"how this works yourself,\nbecause when you understand"},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"a process intrinsically,\nthat will allow you"},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"to actually provide\nmuch better instructions"},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"to a professional, who's then going to"},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"take it to the next level for you."},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I would encourage\nyou to use platforms like"},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"Udemy, like YouTube, to learn how to build"},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"your own WordPress website."},"252":{"dur":1,"text":"And I can assure you,\nwithin a couple of hours"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"you can actually have a book\nsounded website up and running"},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"that's got your information\non, some links for people"},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"to contact you and find out more."},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"And then once you've understood\nthat, now you're gonna"},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"be able to get some proper advice,"},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"pretty free and cheap, as well."},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"So, once you have your website set up"},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to create a page."},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"So a page is like one of\nthose tab buttons that people"},"274":{"dur":4,"text":"click on, and that tab page\nis going to be called courses."},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"So I go to your website and\nI wanna see what courses"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"you got, all I have to do\nis click on the courses tab."},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"What you're gonna do\ninside behind the scenes"},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"is just simply make that\ncourses tab auto redirect"},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"to your online school."},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the student won't even\nrealize that they're actually"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"leaving your website\nbecause your online school"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"is gonna be branded\nwith the same branding,"},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"you can even have the online\nschool with the same URL,"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"so you can create what's\ncalled a subdomain"},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"for your online school\nso that it all matches"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"in the same branding and\nit all feels the same."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"So, your website connects\nto your online school"},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"simply with that auto\nredirection, but also"},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"you can set up on your\nonline school a button"},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"to your website that sends\npeople back there, as well."},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"So you're gonna get them\nto be promoting each other"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"and having links back to each other."},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's talk about online schools now."},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"There are a number of different ways"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"that you can sell online courses."},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"There are three main ways, however."},"332":{"dur":4,"text":"So, one way to sell your\nonline courses is to use"},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"marketplaces, online course marketplaces,"},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll explain these in a minute."},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"The second way to sell online\ncourses is with your own LMS,"},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"learning management system."},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"And the third way to sell\nonline courses is by using"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"plugins and software that\nattach to the back end"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"of your website so that\nyour website becomes"},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"its own subscription based or"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"online school type platform, as well."},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"Which one should you be\nusing and what do they mean?"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"Right, let me explain."},"363":{"dur":4,"text":"So, online course marketplaces\nare a bit like supermarkets,"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"this is the analogy I like to use"},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"to help people understand this principle."},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"So, a supermarket has\nlots and lots of customers"},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"coming through, a supermarket\nsells multiple different"},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"products by multiple different\nbrands and businesses,"},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"so if you sell a product\nthat you want to sell"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"in a supermarket, you're\ngoing to want to get your"},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"product on that supermarket\nshelf because of the fact"},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"that there's tons of customers\ncoming through the door"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"that that supermarket is\ndoing the marketing for."},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"People might buy your product\non that supermarket shelf"},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"even if they didn't intend\nto walk into that supermarket"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"and buy that type of product."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a lot of window\nshopping that happens"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"in supermarkets, I could just\nbe walking through the aisle"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"and I see that thing, oh that looks nice,"},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"pop it in the trolley, okay?"},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you want to have your\nproducts on supermarkets shelves,"},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"for sure, however, when\nit comes to supermarkets"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"who do you think has control\nover the price of the product"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"on that supermarket shelf?"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"It's gonna be the supermarket."},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"If the supermarket decides\nto do a big discount sale,"},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"who do you think decides\nwhat price that goes for?"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"The supermarket, right, not\nyou as you the product owner,"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"the supermarket decides."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"And if the supermarket\ndecides to change the branding"},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"or move the shelves around,\nthey can decide that."},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"So, when it comes to\nonline course marketplaces"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"I want you to have this analogy in mind."},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"You do not get necessarily\ncontrol over the pricing"},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"of your course, you don't\nnecessarily get control over"},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"the discounting that happens\nto the price of your course."},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"And you also don't own the\nstudents that are taking your"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"course, because just like\na supermarket, it's the"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"supermarket's customers, not\nthe product that was purchased"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"from the supermarket's customer."},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"So why would you use them?"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"This is where I get a lot of\nonline course creators going,"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"oh, why would you use\nthese kinds of platforms"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"if you don't even own\nthe student database?"},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, because of the fact that"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"they have millions of students."},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"Why wouldn't you want to\nput your amazing product"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"in front of these people that otherwise"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"wouldn't even know that you exist."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"And importantly, why\nwouldn't you do this when"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"you actually get paid for that exposure."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"So the way I like to see\nonline course marketplaces is"},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"basically as a way to give\nto the world, to share"},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"my message with the world,\nto promote and market myself,"},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"to get exposure to people I wouldn't have,"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"in a way that I actually get paid for it."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"Now a lot of people go out\nthere and happily spend money"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"on Facebook ads to not\nnecessarily get any return."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"Now the way I like to see these\nonline course marketplaces"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"is I'm putting my courses\non them, yes, for cheap,"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"yes, my stuff gets\ngiven away for much less"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"than I'd like it to, however,\nI'm still getting paid"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"to get exposure to a brand new market"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"that someone else is doing the work for."},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I encourage people to\nthink of the online course"},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"marketplace almost as the\nbottom of their funnel."},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"This is where you can\ntake your online course"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"and take a sample of your\nonline course, a smaller,"},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"condensed version of your\nonline course, a taster"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"of your online course, and pop it"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"on these open marketplaces."},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"Now they all have very\nstrict rules, by the way,"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"you have to adhere to\nthese rules and you have to"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"make sure you check them at\nthe time of watching this"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"and doing this because the\nrules change all of the time."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"At the moment in online\ncourse marketplaces,"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"in some of them, you are\nallowed to deliver your course"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"and then at the end incentivize them"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"to maybe book elsewhere\nfor the advanced version"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"of that online course."},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"Now there are rules to\nfollow, so please check them."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"One of these online course marketplaces"},"581":{"dur":4,"text":"is Udemy, U D E M Y, so I\nhighly encourage you all"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"to think how can you take a\nsmaller version of this course,"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"pop it on one of those\nplatforms, and then say, hey,"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"this was just a taster,\nif you enjoyed this,"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"now come on over to my other platform"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"where the full version is available."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you have to make sure\nthat this taster version"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"is actually useful, right?"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"If people took your course and\nwent, well that was rubbish,"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"they're obviously not gonna\ncome and take an advanced"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"version, so it does have to\nbe good, and it does have"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"to be useful, it does have to be helpful,"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"it does have to provide\nthem with strategies,"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"implementation, and some kind\nof transformational outcome."},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's really important."},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"But here's now where we move\nto what we call the LMS,"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"the learning management system."},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"The learning management system,\nit's a bit like WordPress,"},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"right, so, yes it's not\nyour software, however,"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"you buy that software\nand you make it your own,"},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"it belongs to you, you\ncreate your own branding,"},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"you create your own world\ninside that piece of software."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, my favorite one at\nthe moment is Thinkific,"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"there are lots of them out there, however,"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"like please go and look around,\nthey're all quite different,"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"they all have slightly\ndifferent user experiences,"},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"the features, generally\nacross the board, these days"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"are the same, there's a lot\nof competition out there now"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"and it tends to be that when\none gets a sexy new feature"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"the rest of them are\npretty quick to follow up"},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"and get the same, too."},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"So go and do the free trials of them all"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"and decide for yourself,\nplease decide for yourself"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"which one you like to\nuse because it does tend"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"to come down to simply user preference"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"and the feeling you have\nwhen you're using that."},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"But, yeah, Thinkific is my\nsoftware choice at the moment,"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"and I really find it very simple to use"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"with a lot of very advanced\nfunctions despite the fact"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"that it has real user simplicity."},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"So, why is this different\nto a marketplace?"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"The way I like to think of\nthe learning management system"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"is a bit like your own\nboutique store, right?"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"You've bought the land,\nyou've built your own little"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"boutique shop, and it's yours."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"So when people walk into that shop door"},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"you get ownership of\nthose customer details."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"That customer belongs to you."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"You get their email\naddress, you get to deliver"},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"that product to them however\nyou want, you get to choose"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"the pricing of your\nproducts, you get to choose"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"your discounting, your special offers,"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"your big fat open days,\nyou are in complete control"},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"of your own LMS, no one else\ncan dictate or control that."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"Downside is obviously you\nhave to do your own marketing."},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like having your\nown WordPress website,"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"no one is gonna market\nyour website for you"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"unless you are using some\nof the marketing strategies"},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll give you a couple of tips on shortly."},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you do have that\ndifference in that this is"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"your own business, you can't\nexpect people to market you"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"in your own LMS, in your own platform."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is where you're\ngonna put your full courses,"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"your higher end courses,\nyour more expensive programs,"},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"this is where you're gonna\nhave all of your students"},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"actually gathering, having conversations,"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"and communicating with one another."},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"And the third version that I\nmentioned was having plugins"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"attached to your website in the back end."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"So, with the plugins,\nsome of them are free,"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"some of them you pay\nmonthly subscriptions for,"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"some of them you just buy outright and you"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"then own that plugin that then allows you"},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"to upload your courses\nto your own website."},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"Now which one is best?"},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"I believe you should be using all of them."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"All of them have very\ndifferent pros and cons,"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"all of them are used in different stages"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"of your business funnel,\nand therefore all of them"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"should be seen as different\nelements of your business"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"delivery system and your\nmarketing system, as well."},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"You need to have the marketplaces\nto bring in paid leads"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"and you need to have\nthe LMS or the plugins"},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"in order to be able to\nthen deliver that product"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"under your own roof,\nunder your own control,"},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"under your own banner."},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"Now the reason why I,\npersonally, have chosen to host"},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"all of my courses on an\nLMS, a piece of software"},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"outside of my website, is\nbecause websites can crash."},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"Websites require maintenance,\nwebsites require you"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"to be able to respond very\nquickly if things go wrong."},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"True story, just before\nChristmas I'd done a massive"},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"Christmas marketing campaign\nand my website crashed,"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"it died, and it was down for four days."},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"Luckily, because my\nonline school is hosted"},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"off of my website, it\ndidn't affect my sales"},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"and it didn't affect my business"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"and it didn't affect my\nstudents who were enrolled,"},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"who were using Christmas period as a time"},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"to actually do some learning."},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"So I personally have\nthem separate for backup."},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"And what I do have on my\nwebsite is a page that shows"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"each of my different courses,\nand I do have an LMS plugin."},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"So if, for any reason, the\nLMS platform that I use"},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"crashed or died or stopped working,"},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"with the click of a button I can"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"turn my courses live on my website, too."},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"So what I have here is a double backup"},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"so that my business is safe,\nit's fail safe completely."},"863":{"dur":4,"text":"So, by using LMSs, online\ncourses, sorry, online course"},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"marketplaces and plugins,\nthis here now fills in"},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"the middle part of your online school."},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"So you're sending all of\nyour people to your website,"},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"your website has a courses\ntab that auto redirects people"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"to your school, and outside\nof that you're using"},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"online course marketplaces\nand sending them"},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"from the marketplace into\nyour own online school."},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're using that marketplace as leads."},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"You're using your website\nas a way to get leads"},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"into your school."},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"So, talking of leads, now\nlet's talk about lead magnets."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"Those of you who don't\nknow what lead magnets are,"},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"basically it's something you're swapping"},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"in exchange for an email address."},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"However, that thing obviously\nhas to be tasty, exciting,"},"909":{"dur":3,"text":"and useful to the people who\nare looking at it in order"},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"for them to want to exchange\ntheir email address for it."},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"In these days, people hate\ngiving their email address away"},"918":{"dur":3,"text":"because they're pretty\ncertain that they're gonna get"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"bombarded with sales\nemails and stuff like that."},"923":{"dur":1,"text":"So you've gotta make sure\nthat the thing you're offering"},"925":{"dur":1,"text":"is valuable enough for people to go,"},"927":{"dur":1,"text":"yeah, it's gonna be worth\ngetting a bit of junk mail"},"929":{"dur":2,"text":"for this, because that's\nhow people are thinking."},"932":{"dur":3,"text":"So, lead magnets, this could be anything."},"935":{"dur":3,"text":"This could be a taste version\nof your online course,"},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"it could be the recording\nof a useful webinar,"},"942":{"dur":2,"text":"it could be an ebook, it\ncould be a physical book,"},"945":{"dur":2,"text":"it could be a free consultation session."},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"There's all sorts of\nthings that you could use"},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"as a free gift in exchange\nfor that email address"},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"because once you have that email address,"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"obviously you can then take\nwhatever that free information"},"959":{"dur":3,"text":"product or gift was that's the same topic"},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"as your online course, you\nknow that if they've downloaded"},"965":{"dur":3,"text":"that free thing, they are\nclearly interested in that topic,"},"968":{"dur":2,"text":"they're clearly interested\nin finding out information"},"970":{"dur":2,"text":"about that thing, and\ntherefore it's quite likely"},"973":{"dur":2,"text":"that after a taster of you that was free"},"976":{"dur":2,"text":"that they might then want\nto pay a little bit of money"},"978":{"dur":3,"text":"to then take some of your\npaid products or services."},"982":{"dur":3,"text":"So, what I do is I take\neither a free recording"},"986":{"dur":4,"text":"of a free webinar, or I use a\ntaster version of my course,"},"990":{"dur":2,"text":"just small sample, enough\nto give people value,"},"992":{"dur":2,"text":"enough to get them started\non something, to show them"},"995":{"dur":2,"text":"that I do have the\ninformation that I promise."},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"This is your opportunity to show people"},"1000":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're not just making up the fact"},"1002":{"dur":1,"text":"that you know what you're talking about."},"1004":{"dur":2,"text":"It's an opportunity for you to demonstrate"},"1006":{"dur":2,"text":"that you actually know your\nstuff, it's an opportunity"},"1008":{"dur":2,"text":"for you to demonstrate\nand prove that you are"},"1011":{"dur":2,"text":"who you say you are, that\nyou have the expertise"},"1014":{"dur":3,"text":"that you're offering to charge\npeople money to give them."},"1017":{"dur":2,"text":"So, make your lead magnet,\nif you can, something"},"1020":{"dur":1,"text":"that's got video in it so that"},"1022":{"dur":2,"text":"they can have that experience of you."},"1024":{"dur":1,"text":"This is where the real trust comes in,"},"1026":{"dur":2,"text":"this is where people no\nlonger have any doubts"},"1028":{"dur":1,"text":"about you because they've\nseen for themselves"},"1029":{"dur":1,"text":"that you know what you're saying."},"1031":{"dur":2,"text":"So, with lead magnets, there's"},"1034":{"dur":1,"text":"a couple of ways to deliver that."},"1035":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I use a combination of Google Drive,"},"1038":{"dur":2,"text":"Active Campaign, or Lead Pages."},"1042":{"dur":2,"text":"Now Active Campaign I'm\ngonna talk about shorty,"},"1044":{"dur":1,"text":"it's an email marketing software."},"1046":{"dur":1,"text":"I actually only very\nrecently discovered it"},"1047":{"dur":2,"text":"within the last 12 months, wish\nI'd known about it earlier,"},"1050":{"dur":2,"text":"it's absolutely fantastic,\nand has revolutionized the way"},"1053":{"dur":2,"text":"that I run my business now."},"1055":{"dur":3,"text":"But, swiftly now I've become\na super fan and have just"},"1058":{"dur":2,"text":"immersed myself in\nlearning the ins and outs"},"1061":{"dur":3,"text":"of how to use this for running\nan education based business."},"1064":{"dur":2,"text":"So, Google Drive."},"1067":{"dur":2,"text":"Google Apps, guys, is one\nof the best things, as well,"},"1069":{"dur":1,"text":"I've ever started using."},"1070":{"dur":2,"text":"Google Docs, Google Sheets,\nGoogle Slides, they are"},"1073":{"dur":2,"text":"basically free versions of Microsoft Word,"},"1076":{"dur":3,"text":"Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint,"},"1079":{"dur":3,"text":"but they are on the cloud,\nso no matter what device"},"1082":{"dur":2,"text":"you're using you have access\nto all of your documents,"},"1085":{"dur":1,"text":"you're never gonna lose\nstuff, you never have multiple"},"1087":{"dur":1,"text":"versions of everything all\nover the world, you can even"},"1088":{"dur":3,"text":"collaborate with your team,\nor freelancers, or clients"},"1091":{"dur":1,"text":"working on those documents live."},"1093":{"dur":1,"text":"You can actually live be see each other"},"1095":{"dur":1,"text":"working on those documents."},"1097":{"dur":2,"text":"So, by the by, also part of the\nGoogle platform is something"},"1100":{"dur":2,"text":"called Google Drive, so it's\nbasically just an online"},"1102":{"dur":2,"text":"storage, an online folder."},"1105":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I do, for instance,\nif I had a free ebook that"},"1108":{"dur":2,"text":"I wanted to deliver as a lead magnet,"},"1110":{"dur":2,"text":"I take that ebook, save it\nas a PDF, and I upload it"},"1113":{"dur":1,"text":"to the Google Drive."},"1115":{"dur":2,"text":"Now when you upload\nsomething to a Google Drive"},"1117":{"dur":3,"text":"it gives to you a URL, an actual web URL,"},"1120":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can change the\npermissions to that particular"},"1122":{"dur":3,"text":"document, so that only you\ncan view it, so it's private,"},"1125":{"dur":2,"text":"or you can specifically\nonly invite certain people"},"1128":{"dur":3,"text":"by putting their email address\nin, or you can switch it to"},"1131":{"dur":2,"text":"only people with a link\ncan view this document,"},"1134":{"dur":3,"text":"or you can switch it to\npublic, anyone on the internet"},"1137":{"dur":2,"text":"could find this document\nusing the keywords"},"1140":{"dur":2,"text":"that I've made in the title."},"1142":{"dur":2,"text":"So in this particular instance\nfor delivering a lead magnet"},"1144":{"dur":2,"text":"what I do is I go into my Active Campaign"},"1147":{"dur":3,"text":"and you can create what's\ncalled forms in Active Campaign,"},"1150":{"dur":3,"text":"and a form simply is a sheet\nwhere people can put in"},"1153":{"dur":2,"text":"their name, their email address, and then"},"1156":{"dur":3,"text":"it delivers something to\nthem, i.e., your lead magnet."},"1159":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I upload my PDF\nebook to my Google Drive,"},"1164":{"dur":2,"text":"I select the permissions\nto anyone with a link"},"1166":{"dur":3,"text":"can view this, I then take\nthat URL link to the ebook,"},"1170":{"dur":2,"text":"I create my form in Active\nCampaign, and I put that form"},"1173":{"dur":4,"text":"on my website, so it says,\nget Sarah's free ebook now,"},"1177":{"dur":2,"text":"they put in their email\naddress, they put in their name,"},"1180":{"dur":2,"text":"they press submit, and\na thank you page pops up"},"1182":{"dur":3,"text":"by Active Campaign, it's very,\nvery straightforward to do,"},"1186":{"dur":2,"text":"and it gives them the link to the ebook,"},"1188":{"dur":2,"text":"hey, Sarah, thanks so much\nfor downloading the ebook,"},"1191":{"dur":1,"text":"here's your link to get it now."},"1192":{"dur":3,"text":"They click that link, and\nvoila, the ebook is open."},"1195":{"dur":1,"text":"So that really is just\nhow simple this could be."},"1197":{"dur":2,"text":"Now there are far more\ncomplex ways of doing this,"},"1200":{"dur":3,"text":"you can use Lead Pages,\nyou can use a whole series"},"1203":{"dur":3,"text":"of funnels of pages that\nthen upsell to other things"},"1207":{"dur":2,"text":"straight away, but I'm just\ngiving you a big picture"},"1209":{"dur":2,"text":"overview right now, hopefully\nyou can see that it's"},"1212":{"dur":2,"text":"not as difficult as it may sound."},"1214":{"dur":4,"text":"So using Active Campaign,\nit connects to your website,"},"1218":{"dur":1,"text":"Active Campaign connects\nto your website via"},"1220":{"dur":4,"text":"an Active Campaign plugin,\nyou can then use that method"},"1225":{"dur":3,"text":"to collect leads from your\nwebsite, deliver them a product"},"1228":{"dur":2,"text":"that's in line with your\ncourse, and now that you have"},"1231":{"dur":3,"text":"their email address, you can\nnow use that to offer them"},"1234":{"dur":2,"text":"more helpful stuff on the\nthing they're now clearly"},"1237":{"dur":1,"text":"interested in to try and get them to take"},"1238":{"dur":1,"text":"one of your online courses."},"1240":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's how we work with lead magnets."},"1242":{"dur":1,"text":"Then obviously your email\nlist comes into this."},"1244":{"dur":1,"text":"The whole reason that\nyou have your website"},"1246":{"dur":1,"text":"and that you have your lead\nmagnets is so that you can"},"1247":{"dur":3,"text":"collect people's emails, with\nthose emails you can continue"},"1251":{"dur":1,"text":"to show them that you know what you know."},"1252":{"dur":2,"text":"You can continue to help\nthem and provide them"},"1255":{"dur":3,"text":"with useful information by\nsending them really useful emails"},"1258":{"dur":2,"text":"or blog articles, or videos, or tips,"},"1261":{"dur":3,"text":"or offering them discounted\nproducts and services"},"1265":{"dur":1,"text":"that they might be interested in using."},"1266":{"dur":1,"text":"So you want to always be grabbing"},"1268":{"dur":1,"text":"this particular email list."},"1269":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, again, I use Active\nCampaign, and using Active"},"1273":{"dur":3,"text":"Campaign, again, just with\nlead magnets with your"},"1276":{"dur":3,"text":"online school, you can\nstart growing this list."},"1280":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, your online school\ncan connect with your email"},"1284":{"dur":3,"text":"marketing system, this is\nreally, really cool because"},"1287":{"dur":3,"text":"you can now put free courses,\nfree workshops, taster"},"1291":{"dur":4,"text":"courses, recordings of\nwebinars on your online school."},"1295":{"dur":2,"text":"You can even sell products from\nyour online school, as well,"},"1298":{"dur":3,"text":"I sell PDF documents on my online school."},"1301":{"dur":3,"text":"For people to even view\nfree stuff, free content,"},"1304":{"dur":2,"text":"free webinars, free training,\non your online school"},"1307":{"dur":3,"text":"they still have to enroll,\nmeaning you still collect"},"1311":{"dur":3,"text":"that email address when you\noffer something for free"},"1314":{"dur":1,"text":"on your online school."},"1316":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, by connecting your\nemail marketing software,"},"1319":{"dur":2,"text":"in my case Active Campaign,\nto your online school,"},"1322":{"dur":2,"text":"in my case Thinkific,\nyou're actually building"},"1324":{"dur":2,"text":"your email list as well\nas delivering your product"},"1327":{"dur":2,"text":"or service, so this is really cool."},"1329":{"dur":3,"text":"Now here comes another piece of software."},"1332":{"dur":2,"text":"There are lots of pieces of\nsoftware that can integrate"},"1335":{"dur":3,"text":"directly with Thinkific, and\nI know all the time they're"},"1338":{"dur":2,"text":"adding new direct integrations,\nbut, let's face it,"},"1341":{"dur":2,"text":"there are a million billion\npieces of software out there,"},"1343":{"dur":2,"text":"so we can never have\neverything directly integrating"},"1346":{"dur":1,"text":"with everything, I mean, that\nwould just be a ridiculous"},"1348":{"dur":2,"text":"ask, things change far too quickly."},"1350":{"dur":1,"text":"However, there is an\namazing piece of software"},"1352":{"dur":3,"text":"called Zapier, Z A P I E R, Zapier."},"1355":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, this piece of software,\nbasically, is a little online"},"1359":{"dur":3,"text":"tool app website that\nacts a bit like a bridge"},"1362":{"dur":1,"text":"between two pieces of software."},"1364":{"dur":3,"text":"So, Zapier will connect\none piece of software"},"1367":{"dur":3,"text":"to another piece of software\nto make some kind of"},"1370":{"dur":3,"text":"data sharing or communication happen."},"1374":{"dur":3,"text":"So I use Zapier to connect\nmy Thinkific school"},"1377":{"dur":3,"text":"to my Active Campaign\nemail marketing platform."},"1381":{"dur":2,"text":"So, using Zapier, you basically\nput this bridge together"},"1384":{"dur":4,"text":"where you go, hey Zapier,\ncan you tell Active Campaign"},"1388":{"dur":2,"text":"when someone enrolls in\nmy course on Thinkific,"},"1391":{"dur":1,"text":"you can really easily set that up."},"1393":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, Zapier does have a free version,"},"1395":{"dur":2,"text":"you can only set up three zaps."},"1398":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, telling Thinkific\nto tell Active Campaign"},"1401":{"dur":2,"text":"when someone enrolls\nin the school is a zap."},"1404":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I actually have the\npaid version of Zapier"},"1407":{"dur":3,"text":"which I believe is about,\nI think $47 a month,"},"1411":{"dur":2,"text":"so that you can have\nridiculously huge amounts of zaps"},"1413":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can create, because,\nremember, Zapier is used"},"1416":{"dur":3,"text":"to connect any piece of software\nto any piece of software,"},"1419":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's a million ways\nthat I use it to do that."},"1421":{"dur":4,"text":"So, now what you can do,\nusing your online school"},"1426":{"dur":4,"text":"connected to your email list\nwith Zapier, you can now create"},"1431":{"dur":4,"text":"automated email sequences to\nkeep your students engaged."},"1436":{"dur":4,"text":"Completion rates of your online\ncourses is really important."},"1440":{"dur":2,"text":"It's important for your\nstudents, it's important"},"1442":{"dur":3,"text":"for your brand, and it's\nimportant for your bottom line."},"1445":{"dur":2,"text":"So anyone who says, oh, you\nknow, I've had students,"},"1448":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, they've paid\ntheir money, so who cares"},"1450":{"dur":3,"text":"what they do, who cares if\nthey finish my course, right?"},"1454":{"dur":2,"text":"You totally should care,\nbecause if your students aren't"},"1456":{"dur":2,"text":"completing your course\nthen they're not getting"},"1459":{"dur":2,"text":"all of the results, and\nif they're not getting"},"1461":{"dur":2,"text":"all of the results, then\nthey can't walk away from"},"1464":{"dur":2,"text":"that course and say, that\nwas an awesome course,"},"1466":{"dur":2,"text":"you should totally take\nSarah's course, oh my gosh"},"1469":{"dur":2,"text":"that changed my life, that\nreally helped me, this has"},"1471":{"dur":2,"text":"given me strategies that are\ngonna help me going forward"},"1473":{"dur":1,"text":"in blah, blah, blah situation."},"1475":{"dur":2,"text":"So if people don't finish it,\npeople aren't completing it,"},"1478":{"dur":1,"text":"they're not gonna get those\nresults and you're not gonna"},"1480":{"dur":1,"text":"have the ongoing marketing,\nyou're not gonna have"},"1481":{"dur":3,"text":"people's lives that have\nbeen changed, which is"},"1485":{"dur":1,"text":"an important reason to be in this business"},"1486":{"dur":1,"text":"in the first place, right?"},"1487":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you can use your email\nmarketing sequences to now"},"1490":{"dur":3,"text":"automatically keep following\nup with your students."},"1494":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you go into your email\nmarketing campaign system,"},"1497":{"dur":3,"text":"in my case Active Campaign,\nyou click on the automations"},"1501":{"dur":2,"text":"button and you create an automation."},"1503":{"dur":3,"text":"An automation basically is a\nsequence of emails that you"},"1507":{"dur":2,"text":"send out to your students,\nin the most basic form,"},"1510":{"dur":1,"text":"there's actually a lot of other\nways you can use automations"},"1512":{"dur":1,"text":"but let's keep it simple for now."},"1513":{"dur":3,"text":"So, for instance, a student\nenrolls in your free course"},"1517":{"dur":2,"text":"or your expensive course,\nwhatever, they enroll in a course"},"1520":{"dur":1,"text":"on your online school."},"1522":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, Zapier tells Active\nCampaign that that's happened"},"1525":{"dur":2,"text":"and now automatically sends\nthem to a particular sequence"},"1528":{"dur":2,"text":"that you've told Zapier to send them to,"},"1530":{"dur":1,"text":"and this sequence might\ngo something like this,"},"1532":{"dur":4,"text":"email one, hi Sarah, welcome\nto the course on blah,"},"1537":{"dur":3,"text":"here's your link to your\nonline school, because people"},"1540":{"dur":2,"text":"don't wanna be looking for\nlinks, like make this

felt\noverwhelmed, have you ever felt"},"1562":{"dur":2,"text":"blah, blah, blah, have you\never felt, blah, blah, blah,"},"1565":{"dur":1,"text":"right, boring, just talk it to them,"},"1567":{"dur":2,"text":"this is about communication,\nthis is about chatting,"},"1569":{"dur":2,"text":"this is about them simply\nknowing who you are,"},"1571":{"dur":3,"text":"this is about

ready"},"1579":{"dur":2,"text":"to get the best results from it."},"1581":{"dur":1,"text":"So, give them the link\nto the course, tell them"},"1583":{"dur":2,"text":"that they can connect with\nyou, if you've got a Facebook,"},"1585":{"dur":1,"text":"great, tell them they\ncan go and join that,"},"1587":{"dur":2,"text":"put some links at the bottom\nto your social media channel"},"1589":{"dur":3,"text":"so they can follow you and be\nconnected with you everywhere."},"1592":{"dur":1,"text":"Then what you can do with\nActive Campaign is say,"},"1594":{"dur":3,"text":"right, now we've sent that\nwelcome email, let's just wait"},"1597":{"dur":2,"text":"for a few days, you set how\nmany days you wanna wait

check in with them."},"1606":{"dur":3,"text":"So, wait for three days, and\nthen send the next email,"},"1609":{"dur":1,"text":"and the next email will\nsay something

now,"},"1643":{"dur":1,"text":"again, there's a million\ndifferent scenarios, by the way,"},"1645":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm not gonna overcomplicate\nthis particular video,"},"1647":{"dur":2,"text":"you can basically then\nsend a sequence of emails"},"1650":{"dur":2,"text":"with certain periods of\ntime in between each one"},"1653":{"dur":1,"text":"so that you can follow\nup with them and check"},"1654":{"dur":2,"text":"that they are getting on okay."},"1656":{"dur":2,"text":"You want people to complete,\nthe majority of the time"},"1659":{"dur":2,"text":"people are busy and they just\nforget, or they lost the link"},"1662":{"dur":1,"text":"and can't be bothered to find it."},"1663":{"dur":1,"text":"So, by just following\nup with them like this,"},"1665":{"dur":1,"text":"we're gonna make sure that they're"},"1666":{"dur":1,"text":"staying engaged with the course."},"1667":{"dur":2,"text":"You can add

zaps"},"1676":{"dur":3,"text":"that say, Sarah's now got 50%\nof the way through the course,"},"1679":{"dur":2,"text":"please can you tell Active\nCampaign, and then set
