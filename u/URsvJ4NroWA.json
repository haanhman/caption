Yeah, most days I love what I do."},"59":{"dur":0,"text":"I do."},"60":{"dur":2,"text":"- All right, so in the past, you've advised entrepreneurs"},"62":{"dur":2,"text":"to fix your own problem."},"65":{"dur":2,"text":"That's an interesting statement, what'd you mean by that?"},"67":{"dur":1,"text":"- Fix your own problems,"},"69":{"dur":1,"text":"I think the first step,"},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"is to make sure we've prioritized the right problems."},"74":{"dur":2,"text":"Something that has worked for us is we sort of,"},"77":{"dur":2,"text":"cause as a startup, there's just this barrage of problems"},"79":{"dur":1,"text":"that are coming your way."},"81":{"dur":3,"text":"And we only have so much resources and time."},"84":{"dur":0,"text":"And so,"},"85":{"dur":1,"text":"our big task here is to make sure"},"87":{"dur":1,"text":"we're working on the right problems."},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"I like to sort of think out a little further."},"92":{"dur":0,"text":"And our team does, too."},"93":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, if we don't solve this problem,"},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"how bad is it gonna be six months from now?"},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"Is it going to become 10 times worse"},"100":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's gonna completely come back and bite us in the butt?"},"103":{"dur":2,"text":"If so, we should

PlanGrid?"},"116":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well, I think the very first thing"},"117":{"dur":3,"text":"I'd like to say is how bad 1988 sounded."},"122":{"dur":3,"text":"We have to kind of strike that in the future."},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"What we found is a few things."},"131":{"dur":3,"text":"First and foremost, what we saw is a company"},"135":{"dur":3,"text":"with 20, 25 people, with no sales people."},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"With revenues coming in."},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"All the employees with sales people"},"144":{"dur":0,"text":"and they were answering the

market fit."},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"What can we do as investors, as partners?"},"161":{"dur":1,"text":"So we had that."},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we just saw something else and that is,"},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"we had a founder who solved a"},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"problem she had in the business."},"173":{"dur":1,"text":"And let me give you a whole bunch of other cases."},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a lesson to you if you're gonna start a company,"},"177":{"dur":1,"text":"solve your own problem,"},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll give you just four or five

house."},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's how they found that market,"},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"they solved the problem they have called cash flow."},"195":{"dur":4,"text":"The founders of Zappos

to"},"226":{"dur":1,"text":"be a proxy for the next million people."},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"Or the founders of Sysco system here at Stanford, again."},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"Trying to network the

site."},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"The other thing that was saw, though,"},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"was a very passionate founder."},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"Domain knowledge,"},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"solved

investment."},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"- So, we hired a young associate."},"286":{"dur":0,"text":"That,"},"288":{"dur":4,"text":"not only had he started a company right away out of college,"},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"out of MIT that he sold to Twitter, so by the age of 25,"},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"26, he started a company, sold it, understood a few things."},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"But the thing that caught our eye,"},"302":{"dur":4,"text":"he had won 600,000 dollars playing online poker at MIT."},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"And he parlayed that in two seed investments."},"310":{"dur":0,"text":"And,"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"suddenly he was an investor in four or five companies"},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"before joining Sequoia, that we were all interested in."},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, PlanGrid was one of those companies."},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"He had a great nose for investing."},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"And so he made the introduction."},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"Of course, we weren't the only"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"company that Tracy was talking,"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"the only firm, I had to drive to San Francisco

card"},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"that's on my desk of all the"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"feedback she heard on the market."},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"On Doug Leone and Sequoia capital, just to keep me honest."},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"- Doug has a resume, believe it or not."},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"His resume, if you're Doug Leone,"},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"is a sheet with CEO and founders names"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"and their phone numbers."},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"- So it's call anybody, basically."},"359":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'll tell you,"},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"the last two or three times, we've lost money."},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the real measure of a partner,"},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"is not when things are going great."},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"The real measure of a partner is"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"what happens when things aren't going so great."},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I just put them all, just call anybody."},"371":{"dur":0,"text":"Go for it."},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"And she did her homework."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"And we were fortunate enough to be chosen."},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"- That's fantastic."},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, one of the things I'm sure you've seen is this,"},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"relentless resolve, ability to solve problems."},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"That focus I think, you came into some very early adversity."},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"I believe you had three of your four founders parents"},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"who were diagnosed with cancer"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"and one of your founders unfortunately passed away."},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"How did you get through all of that?"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"- I think the problems of genetics and biology"},"401":{"dur":4,"text":"and disease, accidents, the challenges of aging,"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"affects all of us."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just unfortunate that this incredibly tragic"},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"thing happened early on in PlanGrid's life."},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"Life doesn't stop just because we're trying"},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"to do the hardest thing we've done before."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not gonna stop for any of us."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"Antoine was diagnosed with cancer at 27."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's totally unfair."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"It's complete chaos, right?"},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"When he passed, a month before his 30th birthday."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"It was really hard on us, how could it not be?"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"We were trying to get our product out to market,"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"we're busy hacking, talking to users."},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"And I remember I turned the corner in our hacker house"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"in Sunnyvale and I'd find one of my co-founders"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"just sobbing quietly in the corner."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"And this would go on for months."},"465":{"dur":0,"text":"As humans,"},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"we always find a way to cope."},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"We cry, we mourn."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"We build these shields around our hearts"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"to protect ourselves from anymore pain and hurt."},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"And then eventually we find beauty in the world again."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"And we find beautiful distractions."},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"Delicious comforts and we're able to ease some of that pain"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"and be able to open up our hearts again."},"488":{"dur":0,"text":"And so,"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"for the founders of PlanGrid, at that point,"},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"we sort of asked ourselves,"},"494":{"dur":4,"text":"we have this one, precious, short life, to live."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"And we thought that if we could build a tool"},"503":{"dur":4,"text":"that makes construction just a little more efficient."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"We could probably make a good dent in the world"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"in a really impactful and good way."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're also incredibly egotistical,"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"we wanted to build a company that,"},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"we wanted to build a good company,"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"we wanted to show the world"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"that this is how you build a company."},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"Responsibly, that takes care of our employees."},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"And builds undeniable value for our users."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"And is a good business within a community."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we took all of that hurt and we took all of that pain"},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"and we just fueled the company with it."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it was our privilege to do so."},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"- That's amazing."},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"Did you have outside help,"},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"is this something that you and the team just sort"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"of came together to work through the bereavement period"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"and how to keep things focused through this massive chaos"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"and unplanned serious of events?"},"556":{"dur":0,"text":"- So it's already hard enough"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"to like live in a house together with your co founders"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"and working around the clock."},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"Part of this process with the dying co founder is,"},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"there's hospice out our house"},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"and Antoine was coding to the last days."},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"His code is still live in PlanGrid today."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"It's actually quite incredible."},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"We've never seen someone get eaten up"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"by cancer in front of us before."},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's like so frustrating because you're feeling all"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"of this like pain and horror"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"and there's nothing we can do about it."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, our families were over a lot."},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"Antoine's family was over."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"We had care, so."},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"- That's amazing."},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"Now Doug, I'm sure you meet with lots of entrepreneurs."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"Probably look at lots of business plans, get lots of emails."},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm sure you see this common thread of this incredible focus"},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"and this resolve."},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"How do you vet that out, that's obviously a common element."},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm sure you find that with everyone."},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you find that out,"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"how does that character attribute surface"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"and what's that process like?"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"- The process has many flavors."},"630":{"dur":4,"text":"Imagine someone coming to you with an idea and no code."},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"There, you look for clarity of vision, clarity of thought."},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"We had the luxury,"},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"with Tracy and PlanGrid,"},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"the fact that there were sales incoming."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's a heck of a data point."},"647":{"dur":0,"text":"But then,"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"Tracy had to,"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"show us any way that she could go from a terrific founder,"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"that she had the ingredients to become a terrific executive"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"and CEO and leader of the company."},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"Because our best,"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"partner companies are the ones"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"where the founder takes them all the way."},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"When you lose a founder, you lose the soul of a company."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"And so you want to make sure"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"that at least one of the founders can take on."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"And I always remember the meeting at Sequoia capital."},"676":{"dur":0,"text":"And look,"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"we're a friendly place, but we also know reality."},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"And we know when people come to Sequoia,"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"they take that quite seriously."},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we go out of our way to make people feel comfortable."},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"Nobody has their iPhone up, nobody checks email."},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"We're as welcoming as can be,"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's a pretty important day."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"And I remember the presentation."},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"And Tracy up there."},"701":{"dur":0,"text":"Look,"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"I knew she was nervous."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"But I also knew she held it in."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"They say, \"Hold your water.\" kind of thing."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"She held the water and she delivered like a champ."},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"I remember that."},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"And we all came outta that meeting and said,"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"\"This founder has it.\""},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, she answered for us."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"How far can this founder go?"},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"It was pretty clear to us."},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"She had the courage, to go all the way."},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"Because starting a company is really the tough thing."},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"Everything else is kind of mechanical en route."},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"Building a company, it's not easy, don't get me wrong."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"But that doesn't require genius levels."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"Starting a company is at the genius level."},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"Running a company requires courage,"},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"dealing with personality, lots of IQ, can you recruit?"},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"And those kinds of things."},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"But it was clear to us, right after that meeting,"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"and it wasn't a long conversation."},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll admit it to you now,"},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't think I ever told you that."},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a 15 minute conversation."},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"Clearly, when we all say yes, to an investment,"},"760":{"dur":0,"text":"we check ourselves."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,"},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"there's too many yeses too quickly."},"763":{"dur":0,"text":"It was one of those things,"},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"everybody wanted to be an investor,"},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"everybody wanted to be a partner."},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"Plus, she came with a co founder."},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"That had complimentary, kind of skills."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"She knew construction, your co founder was from Pixar,"},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"if I remember correctly."},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"who had the coding experience,"},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"the graphics and we thought that was a match made in heaven."},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"it was more heaven than we ever thought,"},"785":{"dur":4,"text":"because that was her husband, so it was really in heaven."},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"And the next thing,"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"became how can we convince them,"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"to choose us?"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that was kinda the tough part for us."},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"- Is it true that,"},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"the only heart you've ever put on"},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"a term sheet was our term sheet?"},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"- I put a heart?\n- Yeah."},"807":{"dur":0,"text":"- Really?"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know what to say,"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"because I don't remember putting a heart."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"If I put a heart, I don't remember putting a heart."},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"- I'll send it to you, got a copy."},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"- Isn't that nice?"},"817":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"819":{"dur":0,"text":"- You actually told me, you were like,"},"820":{"dur":1,"text":"\"I've never put a heart on a term sheet before,"},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"and this is how I feel about you guys.\""},"824":{"dur":0,"text":"It worked."},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"- I have a reputation of being,"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"a little tough."},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"But I'm tough when things go well."},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"And you'll know when things,"},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"and things have not always gone swimmingly."},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"But you never felt a load of pressure."},"840":{"dur":3,"text":"That time is, how can we help her, can we solve the problem?"},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"It is not adding stress."},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"It is incredibly difficult and stressful to run a company."},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"The last thing you need,"},"849":{"dur":1,"text":"is a partner who adds any stress."},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"So we like to remove stress and help."},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"If I put a heart, that's gonna ruin my reputation."},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"- All right Tracy, so."},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm kind of astounded that you have this"},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"ability to attract incredible talent,"},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"talent's everything at the end of the day, right?"},"872":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a massive talent war here in Silicon Valley."},"873":{"dur":1,"text":"Even at a global level."},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"You've got these super sexy companies,"},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"Airbnb's of the world, et cetera, et cetera."},"879":{"dur":0,"text":"And slack."},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"How do you recruit for a construction company?"},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"Cause obviously you've been really successful in doing that,"},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"what's the magic?"},"886":{"dur":1,"text":"- Something like 20 percent"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"of PlanGrid comes from an architectural engineering"},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"and construction background."},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"So by the time we meet them,"},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"they sort of understand the problem that we're trying"},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"to solve and what we're trying to do."},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"And so that means the other 80 percent does not confirm"},"898":{"dur":1,"text":"a construction background"},"899":{"dur":1,"text":"and so there's a lot of selling to do."},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"I think we've gotten better at it over the years."},"903":{"dur":1,"text":"We've had six years of practice now."},"905":{"dur":2,"text":"Of selling our company and the company's evolved."},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"It's much more compelling to sell."},"911":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think there's three things that we try"},"913":{"dur":3,"text":"to do when talking to people that we want to recruit."},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"Number one is explaining in an incredibly clear way,"},"920":{"dur":2,"text":"the problem that we're trying to solve."},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"And why it's so bad of a problem."},"925":{"dur":3,"text":"Number two, why our product and why our company is going"},"928":{"dur":1,"text":"to be the leader in this space."},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"What we're doing today, that makes it the best product"},"933":{"dur":2,"text":"and what we're doing tomorrow"},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"that's gonna keep us ahead of everyone."},"938":{"dur":2,"text":"And three, helping them understand the market size"},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"and how big the opportunity is for their careers."},"944":{"dur":1,"text":"Because that's all we care about at the end of the day."},"946":{"dur":1,"text":"It's what's in it for me?"},"948":{"dur":4,"text":"If we can nail those three things in a conversation."},"953":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a good thing."},"955":{"dur":1,"text":"- Fantastic, now."},"956":{"dur":2,"text":"Lots of budding entrepreneurs out here."},"958":{"dur":2,"text":"Recruiting is the toughest thing."},"960":{"dur":1,"text":"How have you been able to assess talent?"},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm sure there's many more people that wanna

you recruit?"},"1189":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll say two other things."},"1190":{"dur":2,"text":"It helps to recruit when you've got terrific numbers."},"1193":{"dur":1,"text":"Somebody else can sell you a

we hired a vice president of sales,"},"1235":{"dur":2,"text":"we dated way above our grade,"},"1239":{"dur":3,"text":"we got something we had no right to go get."},"1242":{"dur":1,"text":"An employ

hitter."},"1273":{"dur":1,"text":"Guess who recruited Carol Bartz?"},"1275":{"dur":3,"text":"I may have said Carol Bartz, but it was Tracy and the team."},"1278":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's that ability to tell the story,"},"1281":{"dur":4,"text":"to recruit, to share the dream, to use the we pronoun."},"1285":{"dur":1,"text":"That great founders do."},"1286":{"dur":1,"text":"- Fantastic."},"1287":{"dur":1,"text":"All right, Tracy."},"1288":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it's been five years in the construction business."},"1292":{"dur":2,"text":"Before that, you were in school."},"1294":{"dur":1,"text":"Then you went to a CEO."},"1296":{"dur":1,"text":"How did you do that,"},"1297":{"dur":2,"text":"what skills did you acquire along the way,"},"1299":{"dur":2,"text":"what gave you, first of all,"},"1301":{"dur":3,"text":"the resolve to actually make that huge leap forward"},"1305":{"dur":2,"text":"and take that massive risk?"},"1308":{"dur":2,"text":"And tell me about being a CEO."},"1310":{"dur":2,"text":"- So I'm trained as an engineer and I think as a founder"},"1313":{"dur":2,"text":"there's just so many problems to solve."},"1315":{"dur":2,"text":"Actually, our skillsets translated nicely,"},"1317":{"dur":2,"text":"into being the founder of PlanGrid."},"1320":{"dur":2,"text":"Five co founders were all engineers."},"1323":{"dur":3,"text":"Two construction engineers and three software developers."},"1327":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we sort of look at problems in our challenges"},"1330":{"dur":1,"text":"and we just slice them up into"},"1332":{"dur":2,"text":"smaller things that we can tackle."},"1334":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's this funny side effect that happens,"},"1337":{"dur":2,"text":"if you have any success at all as a startup,"},"1340":{"dur":2,"text":"especially as a first time CEO,"},"1343":{"dur":1,"text":"it's that I am constantly in the"},"1344":{"dur":2,"text":"biggest job I've ever done before."},"1347":{"dur":4,"text":"And so surrounding myself with people who can shore up in"},"1352":{"dur":2,"text":"every way I'm weak on was key to my ability"},"1355":{"dur":1,"text":"to being able to do the job."},"1356":{"dur":3,"text":"Having four other co founders to help take the load."},"1360":{"dur":1,"text":"Now we have,"},"1363":{"dur":3,"text":"our executive team is quite awesome."},"1366":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd go to war with them, any day."},"1368":{"dur":1,"text":"And in a lot of ways,"},"1369":{"dur":2,"text":"running a company feels like we are going to war."},"1372":{"dur":2,"text":"and so, making sure I'm surrounding myself"},"1374":{"dur":2,"text":"with people that I can learn from."},"1377":{"dur":2,"text":"People that can lead and they are sort of my medium"},"1380":{"dur":2,"text":"to lead the company through."},"1383":{"dur":1,"text":"I think we are the average"},"1384":{"dur":3,"text":"of everyone we surround ourselves with."},"1387":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there's also this,"},"1390":{"dur":3,"text":"this need to understand that if I don't grow,"},"1394":{"dur":3,"text":"I won't be PlanGrid's CEO a year from now."},"1398":{"dur":0,"text":"And so,"},"1400":{"dur":3,"text":"I have to believe in myself and I have to make the effort,"},"1403":{"dur":3,"text":"however painful it is to grow as an executive,"},"1406":{"dur":3,"text":"to grow as a CEO, to grow professionally, personally,"},"1410":{"dur":2,"text":"to dive into areas I don't understand at all"},"1413":{"dur":2,"text":"and try to become an expert at it."},"1415":{"dur":4,"text":"And so there's this, this need for change and growth"},"1420":{"dur":1,"text":"and it starts with acknowledgment."},"1422":{"dur":1,"text":"I think I would've been,"},"1423":{"dur":4,"text":"an okay or decent CEO for six to eight months ago."},"1427":{"dur":0,"text":"And so,"},"1430":{"dur":3,"text":"just constantly working at that and I think it's the will"},"1434":{"dur":2,"text":"and whatever it is we're trying to grow on."},"1437":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like a muscle."},"1438":{"dur":3,"text":"it's like running, you run enough, you can run 10 miles."},"1441":{"dur":2,"text":"You do enough pushups and however shaky and painful it is,"},"1444":{"dur":2,"text":"you're gonna be able to do that 15 pushups,"},"1446":{"dur":1,"text":"in a few months from now."},"1448":{"dur":1,"text":"- What does a typical day look like for you?"},"1450":{"dur":1,"text":"Where do you spend your time?"},"1451":{"dur":1,"text":"What do you think about?"},"1452":{"dur":3,"text":"- I think about PlanGrid, constantly."},"1455":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I like getting up early,"},"1457":{"dur":1,"text":"because our clients are up early."},"1458":{"dur":1,"text":"so I'm up by six o'clock."},"1460":{"dur":4,"text":"I like to look at my emails, drink coffee at seven o'clock."},"1464":{"dur":4,"text":"Seven to eight to night, it's nice to crush those emails,"},"1468":{"dur":1,"text":"just because I can actually think."},"1470":{"dur":1,"text":"And then it's a series of meetings,"},"1472":{"dur":3,"text":"I spend a lot of time with the executive team."},"1475":{"dur":2,"text":"I spend a lot of time with the projects"},"1477":{"dur":4,"text":"that are our priorities for the month, for the quarter."},"1481":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, I probably spend about,"},"1484":{"dur":1,"text":"20 percent of my time right now,"},"1485":{"dur":2,"text":"which I'm trying to cut down on,"},"1488":{"dur":2,"text":"just visiting our remote team and being with them,"},"1490":{"dur":2,"text":"meeting with clients, meeting with customers,"},"1493":{"dur":1,"text":"understanding the market."},"1494":{"dur":2,"text":"And then just supporting our remote

helps."},"1511":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, okay."},"1512":{"dur":2,"text":"Tell me about the culture."},"1515":{"dur":4,"text":"Did it sort of just naturally and organically materialize?"},"1519":{"dur":2,"text":"talk about your culture and how that developed."},"1522":{"dur":2,"text":"- I would love to hear your opinion on our

years."},"1530":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm actually most proud of the culture that we've built."},"1534":{"dur":3,"text":"We're sort of this team of incredibly hardworking

culture,"},"1562":{"dur":3,"text":"it's a good, happy place, I would say."},"1565":{"dur":1,"text":"but I would like to hear your perspective,"},"1566":{"dur":1,"text":"cause you see companies."},"1568":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, I'd say, look, it's a healthy culture."},"1571":{"dur":2,"text":"Just for completeness sake,"},"1574":{"dur":3,"text":"when we came across PlanGrid, it was a happy culture."},"1577":{"dur":0,"text":"It was,"},"1580":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd say, it was a happening more than a company."},"1583":{"dur":3,"text":"Forty people, all reporting to the CEO."},"1587":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Tracy] To the founders, at the time."},"1589":{"dur":2,"text":"- Which is cool up to a point."},"1592":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you're gonna grow the company."},"1594":{"dur":2,"text":"And I don't want to get into conventional thinking,"},"1596":{"dur":1,"text":"but you need a little bit of structure,"},"1598":{"dur":2,"text":"you have too much structure, you suffocate."},"1600":{"dur":4,"text":"These incredible, fragile environments early on."},"1604":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, shift one,"},"1607":{"dur":1,"text":"we needed to,"},"1608":{"dur":3,"text":"while not breaking the goodness of the company,"},"1611":{"dur":2,"text":"Tracy, not we, we didn't do anything."},"1614":{"dur":2,"text":"Tracy had to inject some level

like it when it's,"},"1621":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Hey, I'll do whatever I want.\""},"1623":{"dur":0,"text":"And so on."},"1625":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was shift one."},"1626":{"dur":0,"text":"Shift two,"},"1628":{"dur":2,"text":"we missed on a VP marketing twice."},"1633":{"dur":2,"text":"But we didn't miss in any of the other executives."},"1636":{"dur":2,"text":"Our VP of engineering is out of

engineering."},"1645":{"dur":2,"text":"And he came in to an engineering organization,"},"1647":{"dur":4,"text":"that was loose and they were starving for leadership."},"1653":{"dur":4,"text":"But that

things,"},"1662":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Oh, no, the Google person's coming.\""},"1666":{"dur":0,"text":"So I think,"},"1667":{"dur":2,"text":"the culture has shifted."},"1670":{"dur":2,"text":"I like respect, I think that should be way up there."},"1672":{"dur":1,"text":"My number one thing is performance,"},"1674":{"dur":1,"text":"because if you don't have that, you don't have a company"},"1675":{"dur":3,"text":"and then everything underneath goes away."},"1679":{"dur":2,"text":"But I like respect right up there."},"1681":{"dur":1,"text":"But you always want to take the goodness"},"1683":{"dur":1,"text":"and you always want to change and evolve."},"1684":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that the building of a company is"},"1687":{"dur":3,"text":"the constant evolution of that company."},"1690":{"dur":2,"text":"And the constant growth of people."},"1693":{"dur":1,"text":"And most people will continue to grow."},"1695":{"dur":1,"text":"Once and a while you lose some,"},"1696":{"dur":1,"text":"because they don't want to, they're incapable."},"1698":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you hire some more people that can do that."},"1700":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's a dynamic entity, that changes through time."},"1705":{"dur":1,"text":"And it must change through time,"},"1706":{"dur":2,"text":"because every day's different."},"1708":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, I will add, that on a very"},"1710":{"dur":2,"text":"practical and tactical level,"},"1712":{"dur":2,"text":"having recruiters that just filter out,"},"1715":{"dur":2,"text":"like the people who wouldn't have"},"1717":{"dur":1,"text":"been a cultural fit has been key"},"1718":{"dur":2,"text":"for us in our ability to maintain our culture."},"1721":{"dur":1,"text":"And you're right."},"1722":{"dur":2,"text":"As more people come in, the culture's dynamic."},"1724":{"dur":1,"text":"But I would say that,"},"1726":{"dur":3,"text":"whatever was important to us five years ago,"},"1729":{"dur":2,"text":"is still important to us today."},"1732":{"dur":2,"text":"And our recruiters have done an amazing job."},"1734":{"dur":2,"text":"At making sure that by the time our

when,"},"1771":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe an executive, you have"},"1773":{"dur":1,"text":"to have a difficult conversation with them."},"1774":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe the performance isn't there"},"1776":{"dur":1,"text":"or there's something else."},"1777":{"dur":1,"text":"That's always really hard,"},"1778":{"dur":2,"text":"one of the hardest skills as a leader."},"1780":{"dur":2,"text":"How do you go about doing that?"},"1784":{"dur":0,"text":"- Yeah."},"1785":{"dur":1,"text":"We're always told to,"},"1787":{"dur":2,"text":"fire the wrong people

understanding"},"1802":{"dur":2,"text":"and agreement on what we're trying to accomplish together."},"1805":{"dur":1,"text":"And actually, it's so funny"},"1806":{"dur":1,"text":"because it's the same thing in construction."},"1807":{"dur":1,"text":"I worked for a general contractor."},"1808":{"dur":1,"text":"And so you sort of always want to make sure"},"1810":{"dur":1,"text":"that your subcontractors are agreeing"},"1811":{"dur":2,"text":"to what you want them to do."},"1813":{"dur":2,"text":"And you have that commitment and you know,"},"1816":{"dur":3,"text":"hopefully have a good

time."},"1835":{"dur":2,"text":"Not a lot of real world experience."},"1839":{"dur":3,"text":"There's egos at play, there's a lot of psychology at play."},"1842":{"dur":2,"text":"Where's that balance

many reasons why a company may not work."},"1864":{"dur":1,"text":"Take the notion of,"},"1866":{"dur":2,"text":"you threw a party and nobody showed up."},"1868":{"dur":1,"text":"Meaning you built a

start breaking down fast"},"2211":{"dur":1,"text":"when you get to 20 people,"},"2212":{"dur":2,"text":"cause communication starts getting a lot more challenging,"},"2215":{"dur":1,"text":"suddenly

percent,"},"2310":{"dur":2,"text":"I will tell you that we learned a ton from"},"2313":{"dur":3,"text":"founders on how to do things better."},"2316":{"dur":3,"text":"We learned a lot about recruiting from Google."},"2319":{"dur":3,"text":"And so you can always evolve and improve these processes."},"2323":{"dur":1,"text":"The point is, I'll make two points."},"2325":{"dur":2,"text":"Don't just let them all go."},"2327":{"dur":4,"text":"Feel for you to improve on them with your experience."},"2331":{"dur":1,"text":"With your insights,"},"2332":{"dur":2,"text":"because you may find that you may do something better"},"2334":{"dur":2,"text":"than the rest of the world does, point one."},"2337":{"dur":3,"text":"And second point, I'd say choose your first

cheque."},"2347":{"dur":1,"text":"Choose that partner because"},"2349":{"dur":2,"text":"that can make the difference between,"},"2351":{"dur":2,"text":"raise as much capital as you can."},"2353":{"dur":1,"text":"And after the series A,"},"2355":{"dur":1,"text":"you find out you only own as the founder,"},"2357":{"dur":2,"text":"you and the employers only own 32 percent."},"2359":{"dur":2,"text":"Because by the time you do all these seeds."},"2362":{"dur":3,"text":"And they have pro retroactive invested in the next round,"},"2365":{"dur":1,"text":"it seems like free money at first."},"2367":{"dur":2,"text":"So you gotta be very, very clever."},"2369":{"dur":2,"text":"Very, very selfish with the equity."},"2371":{"dur":1,"text":"Invest in

know if you have a specific example"},"2446":{"dur":1,"text":"or maybe a more philosophical."},"2447":{"dur":1,"text":"So one of the most important things"},"2448":{"dur":2,"text":"that all startups

it?"},"2476":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm probably on the wrong path here,"},"2478":{"dur":2,"text":"it's time for me to change my decision"},"2481":{"dur":3,"text":"or make some type of large scale or small

on their problem."},"2499":{"dur":1,"text":"Like they give up too fast."},"2501":{"dur":3,"text":"And they're good problems they've identified and solved."},"2504":{"dur":2,"text":"Although, I'll talk about,"},"2507":{"dur":3,"text":"there's this moment in PlanGrid in early,"},"2510":{"dur":4,"text":"like late 2011, when we're about to launch the product."},"2514":{"dur":2,"text":"iPads were sort

of it."},"2534":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we would show potential clients PlanGrid"},"2538":{"dur":2,"text":"and everyone would look and say \"Oh, that's really great."},"2540":{"dur":1,"text":"I would love that,"},"2541":{"dur":2,"text":"but we can't really invest in these mobile devices."},"2544":{"dur":3,"text":"We're not going to, cause no one else is.\""},"2547":{"dur":2,"text":"And so there was this moment where it was like,"},"2550":{"dur":3,"text":"is the construction industry going to ever use tablets?"},"2553":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we sort of knew that they were the perfect devices."},"2556":{"dur":1,"text":"It's computing power that we can take out"},"2558":{"dur":2,"text":"to the field for the first time

would.\""},"2571":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we actually went out and maxed out our credit cards,"},"2575":{"dur":2,"text":"bought a ton of iPads and at the time Apple had limits"},"2577":{"dur":1,"text":"on how many devices you could buy,"},"2579":{"dur":2,"text":"cause they were only manufacturing so much."},"2581":{"dur":1,"text":"So we went in,"},"2584":{"dur":2,"text":"we'd buy like two or three at a time."},"2586":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we'd go from store to store."},"2587":{"dur":3,"text":"And swipe our credit cards until we had something like 20."},"2590":{"dur":1,"text":"And I remember that night when we"},"2592":{"dur":2,"text":"went back to our hacker house in Sunnyvale."},"2595":{"dur":2,"text":"It was everything we had."},"2598":{"dur":2,"text":"And they were so valuable to us."},"2600":{"dur":1,"text":"And we were gonna go deliver it"},"2601":{"dur":1,"text":"to the job sites the next day"},"2603":{"dur":1,"text":"and I had convinced my co founders"},"2604":{"dur":2,"text":"that we were totally gonna get robbed that night."},"2607":{"dur":1,"text":"And so then we started shoving"},"2608":{"dur":1,"text":"them into the kitchen cabinets."},"2610":{"dur":3,"text":"And I remember Ryan had put one like above the refrigerator."},"2613":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was like,

too,"},"2632":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that's, always a difficult question."},"2634":{"dur":2,"text":"Airbnb had, a couple spectacular pivots."},"2637":{"dur":1,"text":"But when do you know, when to
