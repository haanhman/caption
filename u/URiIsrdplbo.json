growth?"},"159":{"dur":4,"text":"The single most important\nthing to growth is retention."},"165":{"dur":5,"text":"Adam commented on this in his talk, and he\nshowed you cohorts from some real company."},"170":{"dur":4,"text":"But here is a stylized cohort of\nhow you should look at retention."},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"The number of days from\nacquisition is on the x axis."},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"On the y axis is the percent of\npeople who has still monthly active."},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"I care a lot about using monthly active,\nnot daily active, not weekly active."},"185":{"dur":3,"text":"There are really good arguments for using\ndaily active that people say all the time."},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it's about intensity of usage."},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"But what really, really matters is\nthat you got skin in the game and"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"people come back to your\nproduct at least once a month."},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you build on top\nof that engagement revenue,"},"198":{"dur":3,"text":"whatever your key metrics are which\nwe'll get to in a minute, but

got a real graph for\nrevenue in a few slides from Facebook from"},"213":{"dur":3,"text":"the first 250 days of our ads products,\nwhich I'll show you."},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"But the thing that's really,\nreally important is to say that,"},"221":{"dur":5,"text":"it's very easy to calculate this curve\neven if you have 1,000 or 100 users."},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"And what you do is you look at all\nof your users on the first day"},"231":{"dur":1,"text":"after they signed up."},"232":{"dur":0,"text":"Were they monthly active?"},"234":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes, clearly, right?"},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"The first 30 days everyone's\ngoing to be monthly active."},"238":{"dur":3,"text":"I'd prefer if you defined a month as 28\ndays, by the way, because multiples of"},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"seven is really, really good for\nthese kind of metrics because of weeks."},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"But for the first 30 days, everyone\nhas been active on their first day,"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"on their second day, on their third\nday as a monthly active user,"},"250":{"dur":0,"text":"whether they came back or not."},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"And then what you

for 31 days."},"263":{"dur":3,"text":"So what percentage of them\nwere active on day 31,"},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"what percentage of them\nwere active on day 32?"},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"And as you go further and further out in\nthe number of days since registration,"},"273":{"dur":4,"text":"the number of people who have been\non your service that long declines."},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"Which means that your metric is\ngoing to get noisier, right,"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"as you get out to the far\nright hand side of that curve."},"284":{"dur":4,"text":"But that doesn't mean you can't get\na handle of where things flatten out very,"},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"very early on with very\nsmall numbers of users."},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"The number one criticism people give me\nwhen I talk about retention as a metric."},"295":{"dur":4,"text":"Or even when you look at what Adam\npresented in his presentation earlier is"},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"you need lots and lots of users."},"302":{"dur":4,"text":"So you need millions of users to\ncalculate that, that is not true."},"306":{"dur":3,"text":"We did it with thousands of users in the\nearly days of advertisers for Facebook for"},"310":{"dur":0,"text":"example."},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"Or you need to have had all of those\nusers on for a very long time."},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"Look at Adam's graph it was multiple years\nwith months, and months, and months."},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"No, you can do it day by day, and"},"322":{"dur":3,"text":"you can get to a really good place super,\nsuper fast, using this methodology."},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"So what you're looking for\nin a retention curve?"},"330":{"dur":5,"text":"You're looking for it to flat line above\nzero, not flat line like a heart monitor."},"335":{"dur":4,"text":"You want it to flat line at some line\nthat asymptotes with the x-axis."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"There are three types of\nthese curves that I've seen."},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"The first type is where\nasymptotes to the x-axis."},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"Like really, really close,\ngoes down to almost zero."},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"You hear about a lot of those companies."},"351":{"dur":4,"text":"You think about most games,\nmost games are smash hits."},"355":{"dur":4,"text":"How many people use FarmVille now versus\nhow many people used FarmVille at its"},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"absolute, please tell me\nyou know what FarmVille is."},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"[LAUGH] Yeah, okay, all right."},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"How many people used

it?"},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"FarmVille was a smash hit, then there's\nother ones which look like this,"},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"where they stabilize out."},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"So you think about Minecraft,\nright, or World of Warcraft."},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"These games that somehow have network\neffects and people stay in them for"},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"a long time."},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"The other version for this curve I've seen\nis the ones where they go down, they look"},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"like they're going to hit the x-axis and\nthen they re-accelerate and they go up."},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a few different things that can\ncause that right, so you have this,"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"this overwhelming thing that is driving\nyou down to have zero retention and"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"somehow the numbers go up again."},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"So things that drive that for\nbusinesses, and"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"you actually I think\nmentioned this in your intro."},"406":{"dur":4,"text":"One, network effects, so"},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"when all your friends get on Facebook,\nyou're much more likely to use Facebook."},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"When all your friends get on Twitter,"},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"you'll more likely use the Twitter,\nWhatsApp, Messenger."},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"Whichever social service\nyou're talking about,"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"there are network effects\nthat really matter."},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"Network effects also\ncount in marketplaces."},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"When you have enough sellers,\nyou can have enough buyers."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"When you have enough traffic,\nyou get more sellers."},"431":{"dur":4,"text":"And so as marketplaces go, often what you\nfind is these old cohorts that signed up"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"resurrect and come back to the service."},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"So network effects can drive the curve\nup after it's flatlined somewhere or"},"441":{"dur":0,"text":"is heading towards zero."},"442":{"dur":5,"text":"The second thing that can do this\nis opening up a new interface."},"448":{"dur":0,"text":"So think about it."},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of people release\ntheir apps first on iOS."},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"I actually loved Diane's talk last week\nfor this, by the point that he made of"},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"starting with Nokia, focusing on Android\nbecause it's what most of the world use,"},"461":{"dur":5,"text":"but in Silicon Valley we typically build\nour apps first on iOS more often than not."},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"And then when someone releases\nan Android application, and"},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"this was something I saw with\nInstagram years and years ago."},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"But when you release\nan Android application,"},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"people might have tried it on an iPhone\nAnd then traded their iPhone for"},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"an Android and\nno longer be able to access your service."},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"People might've tried your\nservice on a friend's iPhone and"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"then when you add an Android they\ncome back and use your service."},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's another thing that\ncan drive you up again."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the third thing that I've seen\non this curves that drive this curves up"},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"again is adding categories,\nso think about Amazon."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"There was a really good discussion,\nwas that Stuart earlier or?"},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"Someone earlier in this talked about\nAmazon, and how Amazon started with books"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"because there was this large\ninventory available of books."},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"But then they added in another category."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"And then they added in\nanother category over time."},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"And imagine, there will be people who came\nto Amazon to buy that one book, but then"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"two years down the line Amazon suddenly\nhad kitchenware, I don't know, or fashion."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"And they came back and\nthen they bought fashion and"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"they brought them more use cases\nto come back more monthly active."},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"This was true with eBay."},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"We added motors."},"528":{"dur":4,"text":"I remember being at eBay and\nwe had to do all of our reporting on"},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"gross merchandise volume with and\nwithout motors."},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"And no one had ever believed that you\ncould buy a car online, and eBay did it."},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"And it created a whole new use case for\npeople, many of whom were existing eBay"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"customers, who now had one more\ncategory they could shop in."},"547":{"dur":5,"text":"So you want to curve the asymptotes\nto a line parallel to the x-axis."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"You can do it with far more\nlimited amounts of data"},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"than most people think you can by using\nthe technique I outlined earlier, and"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll show you a real world\nexample in a few slides."},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are three types\nof curves that I've seen."},"564":{"dur":4,"text":"Curves that asymptote like this,\nawesome, your company will survive."},"569":{"dur":0,"text":"And how big will it get?"},"570":{"dur":0,"text":"We have another question."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"Curves to go straight to zero."},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"That's okay, you could be in games and"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"your job is to produce one hit\nafter another after another."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"EA doesn't expect whatever fee for 2012,"},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"they still have lots of users\nnow if they've released FIFA 27."},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's okay, there are businesses\nwhere hitting the x axis is okay."},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"But you need to know you're\nin one of those businesses."},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"And then the third that I've\nseen is the curve going up."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"And that can be driven by network effects."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"That can be driven by being\navailable on more platforms."},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"That can be driven by adding categories\nto your marketplace or service."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"From this falls out a brilliant\nway to look at growth, and"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"this guy Danny Ferrante who was at Yahoo."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"Who was one of the first members of\nthe growth team runs core data science at"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"Facebook, he's totally awesome."},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"He's really the brains behind\nthe operation I'm the mouth."},"617":{"dur":4,"text":"Danny came up or brought this to Facebook,\nand it's a simple way to look at growth."},"621":{"dur":5,"text":"We were looking at growth as how many\nusers were we growing by week on week?"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"We looked at it on an absolute basis."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"And looking at it like\nthat we were like okay so"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"we're signing up whatever\nit was a million a week and"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"we're growing by whatever it was\n800,000 a week I don't know."},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"Cool, we're churning 200,000 people."},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"And we never actually\nlooked at it in this way."},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"When we change the way we look\nat things to say well okay,"},"645":{"dur":4,"text":"the net growth is 800,000 a week,\nthe new users are 1 million a week."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"But what is churn and resurrection?"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"And what we actually found at the time,\nand"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"I can't remember the absolute numbers so\nI'll just make some up."},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"But imagine you're churning 1.3 million."},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"So not 200,000, 1.3 million."},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"You're resurrecting 1.1 million."},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"So plus 1 minus 1.3 plus 1.1,"},"671":{"dur":4,"text":"you've got net 800,000 in growth."},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"But that 800,000 in\ngrowth is being driven,"},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"I think I did the math wrong, but\n800,000 in growth is being driven by"},"682":{"dur":5,"text":"a different order of magnitude from churn\nand resurrection than you realized."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that helps you focus on\nhow do I stop people churning?"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"How do I get people to come back to my\nservice who are not coming back to my"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"service right now?"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"So once you have your retention curves,\nand"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"once you start to have\na business with retention."},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"You need to look at\nyour growth accounting,"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"not just how many users are we acquiring."},"707":{"dur":0,"text":"Make sense?"},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"Overall the number one thing\nI focus on for growth,"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"and the one thing that we focus on for\ngrowth is retention."},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"So what gets you retained\nin any given service?"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"Magic Moment."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"What is the moment when you used Airbnb?"},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"What is the moment when

moment."},"764":{"dur":0,"text":"You look at Airbnb, right?"},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"They talked about the delight\nthat they give people."},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"They talked about these

are waiting for the auction to finish\nand view to make your first purchase."},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"That was such an adrenaline\nendorphin moment."},"807":{"dur":0,"text":"But users loved

them?"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"Well you can find them in\nthe non scalable way which is"},"817":{"dur":1,"text":"don't they just sound relatively obvious?"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"You can actually think through what\nis the experience on my product?"},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"What do I want people to do?"},"824":{"dur":4,"text":"You can ask your first users, okay,\nyou're keeping using my

talked at\nstartup school himself and"},"856":{"dur":5,"text":"he said that we focused on getting\npeople to ten friends in 14 days."},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a smooth curve,

curve."},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"But there's a strong correlation between"},"879":{"dur":3,"text":"number of friends you've got in the first\n14 days and whether you retain or

first week, probably they are actually\ncorrelated with whether you retain or not."},"913":{"dur":4,"text":"So you need to look for the magic moment\nof your product by talking to users
