Thanks."},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"The second was that they were very systematic\nin the way that they asked questions.

Yeah? Okay."},"384":{"dur":0,"text":"[Cough]"},"385":{"dur":6,"text":"So, and then finally, the fourth distinction\nwas that they had a very effective and efficient"},"392":{"dur":5,"text":"common language.

You would expect people to say, \u201cPeople\nneed to be aligned.

Does it\nreally matter how we think, what goes on in"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"our heads? You know, we talk about people\nbeing the most important part of this whole"},"568":{"dur":4,"text":"endeavor, and they are. So, it kind of matters\nwhat they\u2019re thinking, what they\u2019re saying,"},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"what they\u2019re doing, how they\u2019re behaving.\nAnd there\u2019s a science behind that and we"},"577":{"dur":4,"text":"spend a lot of time, that\u2019s our sweet spot\ntalking about the way in which people think."},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"And then finally, a transformational people\nplan for Lean transformation.
