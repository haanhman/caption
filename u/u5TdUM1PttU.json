{"0":{"dur":0,"text":"[MUSIC PLAYING]"},"2":{"dur":1,"text":"SCOTT JOHNSTON:\nI'm Scott Johnston."},"4":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm on the Hangouts team."},"5":{"dur":1,"text":"Thanks for coming\nto this session."},"7":{"dur":1,"text":"We're going to talk\nabout team communications"},"9":{"dur":2,"text":"and how we've been thinking\nabout them in G Suite."},"14":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that one of the early\nquestions when we started"},"16":{"dur":5,"text":"working on Hangouts for\nproductivity and for teams was,"},"21":{"dur":2,"text":"what really makes\na successful team?"},"24":{"dur":4,"text":"And you may have seen us publish\nwithin Google a study called"},"28":{"dur":4,"text":"Aristotle, where we followed\nteams over many, many years"},"33":{"dur":2,"text":"and looked for what\ncharacteristics really"},"35":{"dur":1,"text":"made a successful team."},"37":{"dur":3,"text":"We've done that with our\nG Suite customers as well."},"40":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's really\nwhere we started"},"42":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of getting\nto the heart of what"},"45":{"dur":3,"text":"tools do we need to provide\nteams with to make them better"},"49":{"dur":4,"text":"And really to make a team of 300\nfunction like a team of three."},"54":{"dur":2,"text":"And so one of the core--"},"56":{"dur":2,"text":"there's a number of takeaways--"},"58":{"dur":2,"text":"well one of the key\nones for me was really"},"61":{"dur":6,"text":"that there wasn't a lot of\ncommonality between work styles"},"67":{"dur":7,"text":"or particular behavior\nof the teams in terms"},"75":{"dur":4,"text":"of being highly\ncommunicative or not so,"},"80":{"dur":1,"text":"or having a certain\nset of personalities"},"81":{"dur":2,"text":"or having a key mix\nof personalities."},"84":{"dur":1,"text":"But really in the\nend the foundation"},"86":{"dur":1,"text":"of the most successful\nteams that we"},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"found when we did\nresearch was that it"},"90":{"dur":1,"text":"was driven by experiences."},"91":{"dur":5,"text":"So their foundations were what--"},"97":{"dur":5,"text":"the foundations were the\nbase of how they interacted."},"102":{"dur":2,"text":"And those came\nthrough in that they"},"105":{"dur":1,"text":"were able to have\nemotional interactions."},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"So they were able to connect\nat a level that was usually"},"109":{"dur":2,"text":"outside of work."},"112":{"dur":4,"text":"They had-- they could have\ncomplex conversations that"},"116":{"dur":3,"text":"were often heated and\nintense, and people"},"119":{"dur":3,"text":"felt safe having those\nkinds of conversations."},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"And everyone seemed to\nhave a mix of work styles."},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they needed tools that\nsupported those work styles."},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"They had a great deal of control\nover deciding when you were"},"131":{"dur":1,"text":"going to work and\nwhen you weren't."},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"Excuse me."},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that really was at the\nfoundation of the products"},"137":{"dur":4,"text":"that we built, both from\nJamboard through to Hangouts."},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the other thing\nthat we just have seen,"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"and I don't need\nto tell you this,"},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"is just this\nproliferation of tools"},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"that we can use now\nto be productive."},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"And the more tools the better."},"157":{"dur":3,"text":"But at the same time people\nwere jumping between and having"},"161":{"dur":1,"text":"trouble staying in the loop."},"162":{"dur":1,"text":"Even something as\nsimple as a spreadsheet"},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"to track something\ngoing on requires"},"166":{"dur":1,"text":"us to go to that spreadsheet."},"168":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's a\ncognitive step there."},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"And that takes time."},"172":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we really\nneeded to figure out"},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"a way to take communication\nand span it across an ecosystem"},"177":{"dur":4,"text":"maps, not just create a new\nhome that people would go to,"},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"and think that would\nsolve the problem."},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what we\nannounced this morning,"},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"for those of you who\nweren't at the keynote,"},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"is a rebuilt Hangouts."},"193":{"dur":5,"text":"And there are really two\ncomponents of team productivity"},"199":{"dur":1,"text":"that we focused on."},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"One was the virtual\nroom within chat."},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"And then the other was meetings,\nface-to-face meetings being"},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"key, getting you into meetings."},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"And there was a session earlier\ntoday, maybe some of you"},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"made on Hangouts Meet."},"213":{"dur":1,"text":"But what this session\nis going to talk about"},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"in a bit more\ndetail is really how"},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"we rebuild Hangouts chat, the\nfocus on team productivity."},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"There were really\nthree key principles"},"226":{"dur":1,"text":"that we were working with."},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"One was this ability to focus."},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's a couple different\naspects around focus and teams."},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"One is your ability to turn\noff whatever communication tool"},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're using so\nit doesn't bother you,"},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"and you can focus\nand get into flow."},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"But also, even within\nthe communication tool,"},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"we knew we had to\nfigure out a way"},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"that, especially in real\ntime communications,"},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"a way to allow people to have\nconversations that didn't"},"252":{"dur":1,"text":"interrupt other conversations."},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"And we've all seen this\nin consumer chat tools,"},"256":{"dur":4,"text":"where conversation will get\nwoven and fragmented, really."},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"You'll be deep in\none conversation,"},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"and another person will\nbring up another topic."},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"And that fragments\nthe conversation"},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"and often is very\nfrustrating to users."},"268":{"dur":4,"text":"So we had to figure out a\nway to get a form of focus"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"on the ability to drill\ninto a particular topic"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"without interrupting others."},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"Expression was key."},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is linked to what\nI was talking about earlier,"},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"around teams really\nneeding to be"},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"able to connect at\nan experience level"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"and at an emotional level."},"287":{"dur":4,"text":"And then the other core part was\nconnecting the different tools,"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"bringing them into the same UI."},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"And then automation was core."},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"And that really--"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"I know we talk at Google a\nlot about machine learning,"},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"but automation actually starts\nearlier than machine learning."},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"Which is-- even our own\nproducts, for example,"},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"take way too many\nsteps for you guys,"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"for you folks to do things."},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're in a six person\nmeeting, creating a Docs file"},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"and sharing it with\nthose six people"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"is way too many steps right now."},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"And so there's a\ncoarse automation focus"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"we needed to have to\nstart to automatically do"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"things that require too\nmany steps right now."},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's just a simple\ncomputer science problem, not"},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"a machine learning problem."},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"But we knew we needed\nto start there."},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's where, when you look\nat some of what we talked about"},"332":{"dur":4,"text":"this morning around the Meet\nagent that automatically"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"schedules things for you,\nthat's what that's about,"},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"is how do we eliminate\nas many steps"},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"from your day as\npossible, so you"},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"can focus on the work at hand?"},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"Like other products\nin G Suite we"},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"knew we had a strong\nfocus on the enterprise."},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"That's everything from\nsecurity to scalability."},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"And scalability doesn't\njust mean classic fan out"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"and ability to handle\na lot of users,"},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"but also the ability\nto really work"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"within an organization\nin a scalable way."},"366":{"dur":4,"text":"And so what you'll learn\nabout Hangouts Chat is"},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"that the structures of it can\nbe wired up to Google Groups"},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"or connected to central\nidentity systems"},"378":{"dur":4,"text":"such that you can\nhave rooms configured"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"around specific teams\nand departments,"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"such that you're not\ndealing with this giant pile"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"of discussion rooms."},"390":{"dur":3,"text":"But instead it's divided\ninto topical areas"},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"that are relevant to your team."},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"And what that means\nis that you can"},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"scale across an enterprise\nand not just work"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"in a small business setting."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"Accessibility is core to\neverything we do in G Suite."},"407":{"dur":4,"text":"And so that's the foundation\nof everything in design"},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"from the very beginning."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"Reliability, ease of\nuse, these are things"},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"that are just part of our DNA."},"420":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we're going to talk now--\nwe're going to bring up Mike,"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"who works within\nthe Hangouts team--"},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"and we're going to walk\nthrough a more detailed demo"},"429":{"dur":5,"text":"of Hangouts chat, just\nto dive into details"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"beyond this morning."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"MIKE SORVILLO: MIKE: Cool."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you guys."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"We all know there's\nthis perfect process"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"that you'll put in place for\na new idea, new products,"},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"a new project, but never goes\nthe way you want it to go."},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"It's always a bit more organic,\na bit more unstructured."},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're going to show\nyou how a team at Tegu Toys"},"458":{"dur":3,"text":"uses the new Hangouts\nChat to plan a new product"},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"and get it out to the market."},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"So can we switch to\nthe demo, please?"},"470":{"dur":0,"text":"Perfect."},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"So the first thing\nyou'll notice is"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"we have a brand new web UI we\njust built from the ground up,"},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"completely dedicated to\njust a chat interface."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"So just like Hangouts today,\nwe have direct messages"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"where you can talk one\non one with somebody."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"Right now I'm\ntalking with Mandy."},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"She put a-- we're just having\na conversation about some"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"of the existing toys."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"And I mentioned that I\nhave a new idea for a toy"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"that I want to work on."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"So one of the main things we've\nadded to the new Hangouts Chat"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"are rooms, the ability to\ncentralize conversations"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"around projects or teams."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"So instead of actually--\nthanks, Mandy."},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"Instead of actually having\na conversation right"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"here with Mandy, I want to bring\nVarun into the conversation"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"And I want to create a\nroom for this new project."},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"So what I'm going\nto do is I'm going"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"to go down here,\nclick the Add button,"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"and create a new\nroom for the project."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to add Mandy and\nVarun to the room itself,"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"and put a Google doc in the\nroom that talks a little bit"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"more details about the project."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"Now all I have to do to\nbring Mandy into the room"},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"is just at mention\nher, and Varun as well."},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"And right away they're brought\ninto the room and ready to go."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"The new Hangouts Chat also\nlets you add Google Groups"},"565":{"dur":0,"text":"as members."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you use Google\nGroups to manage identity"},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"across your whole\ncompany, you can"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"reuse those same groups\nto deploy Hangouts Chat"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"to your entire organization."},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"The other thing you'll\nnotice is that I just"},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"pasted a Google Docs link."},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"We have deep integration with\nGoogle Drive and Google Docs."},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"So any link you post\nwill automatically"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"get a beautiful thumbnail\nrendered right in line,"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"so everybody can quickly\nget back to files,"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"in addition to the\nfact that we changed"},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"the file permissions to\nautomatically match the room."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"So everyone in the\nroom can have access."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"And we remove the mundane task\nof requesting access and giving"},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"access, so people could just\nstart working immediately."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"So this right now,\nthis is what we"},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"like to call the seed\nof the team, right?"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"We have an idea."},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"We have some content."},"610":{"dur":0,"text":"We have some people."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"We have some conversation."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"And the thing you'll\nnotice is, we didn't"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"need to bother IT about this."},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"We didn't need to\nsay hey, can you"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"please create an\nemail alias for us?"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"Or hey, can you\nprovision something new"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"on our on-prem filer for us."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"We just got together,\nstarted working immediately."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can see right now,\neveryone's busy at work."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"Mandy's putting a bunch\nof stuff into the chat."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"She put a projection\nspreadsheet into the chat."},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"Varun's putting a Gantt\nchart into the chat"},"636":{"dur":4,"text":"for how we can actually get\nthis project moving forward."},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"And we recognize that when\nyou're working on projects"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to be talking\nabout different things."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"So one thing you'll notice\nis that rooms are threaded."},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"We let you separate\nthe conversation"},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"and keep context around\ndifferent things."},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"So the conversation about\nthe projections spreadsheet"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"can be separated from the\nconversation about the Gantt"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"chart."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"And threads are not just\ngreat for separating out"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"different topics\nwithin it, but it also"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"helps separate the unimportant\nchitchat that happens,"},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"like where do you\nwant to go for lunch,"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"or what movie did\nyou see this weekend,"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"from the important work."},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"Now these threads are not\nmeant to feel heavyweight."},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"They're not meant to feel like\nsomething you need to manage"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"or you need to organize."},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't want to put\nwork on the user."},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"So the way they work is whenever\na new thread gets updated, it"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"bumps down to the bottom."},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"And you'll get notified."},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"And you'll be able to see all\nthe things you haven't read."},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"So over time what\nends up happening is,"},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"all the important discussions\nbubble up to the bottom."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"And all of the\nunimportant stuff,"},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"or the stuff that's\nbeen resolved,"},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"just kind of floats into the\nether of the chat history."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"So you'll see right\nhere that there's"},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"a bunch of conversation\ngoing on with Mady and Varun"},"710":{"dur":0,"text":"on the Gantt chart."},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm sure everyone\nin the audience"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"has experienced this before,\nwhere you text a friend,"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"they text you back, you text\nthem again, they text you back."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"And eventually you're\nlike OK, please just stop."},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's just talk\non the telephone."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"This is taking forever."},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"So we recognize this happens\nat work all the time as well."},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we've done is we've\ndeeply integrated Hangouts"},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"Meet into Hangouts chat."},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"So when I want to just\nstop the chat conversation,"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"I can click this\nbutton down here"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"and insert a video meeting,\nwrite a little note."},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"Post it into the chat room."},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"And now a video\nmeeting was created."},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"With one click I could\njump into the meeting."},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm put into a green room\nwhere I can see how I look,"},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"see who else is in the meeting."},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I can jump\ninto the meeting."},"760":{"dur":3,"text":"And you'll notice Mandy's\nin the meeting right now."},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"And we could get started."},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is Hangouts Meet."},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"Like Scott mentioned\nearlier, hopefully you guys"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"caught the session earlier."},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"We talked about it a little\nbit at the keynote itself."},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"Oh, everybody left."},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"We talked about it at\nthe keynote itself,"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"so I'm not going to spend a lot\nof time talking about it right"},"781":{"dur":0,"text":"now."},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"But at a high level,\nspecifically designed"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"with enterprise use in mind."},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"So a completely new code base."},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"Less code means\nfaster CPU speed,"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"better performance, and\nspecific enterprise features,"},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"like one click to present, the\nability for non-Google Apps"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"customers to dial\ninto a meeting,"},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"and the ability\nfor people to dial"},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"in on the road with a\ndial-in telephone number."},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"So we were able to take this low\nbandwidth conversation in chat"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"and move it to a high bandwidth\nconversation with video"},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"and resolve it very fast."},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"So some time has\npassed, and I want"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"to add Nicole to this project."},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"So I'm going to do that on the\nnew Hangouts Chat mobile apps."},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"Can we switch to the\n[INAUDIBLE] vision please?"},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"Great."},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"So-- wonderful."},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"So I have to do, like\nbefore, when I want"},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"to add someone to the meeting--"},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"to the room, excuse\nme, is I just"},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"need to at mention\nthem to bring them in."},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"So we'll type Nicole's name."},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll add her."},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"Acknowledge she's going\nto be in the room."},"845":{"dur":1,"text":"And now she's brought\ninto the room."},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is where\nrooms really shine."},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you onboard\nnew employees,"},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"there's always a ramp\nup period, right?"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"You need to tell the new\nemployees what they should"},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"be reading, what\neverybody's working on,"},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"the way your team works."},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"You know they spend\nsome time rifling"},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"through some outdated filers,\nlooking at stale documents that"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"really are kind of irrelevant\nand don't even matter anymore."},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"But the great thing\nabout this now"},"869":{"dur":1,"text":"is that Nicole's in this room."},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"She can see the most\nrecent conversations."},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"She could jump right into the\nmost recent conversations."},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"And she could see all\nthe files as well."},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"And the most recent\nones are probably"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"the most relevant ones as well."},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"And like I mentioned before,\nbecause we have deep Drive"},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"integration, Nicole already\nhas access to these files."},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"So we don't need to\nretroactively give her access"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"to the files, which is great."},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"So over time this\nroom becomes very"},"893":{"dur":1,"text":"much like a\ncentralized team hub,"},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"a team repository, where all\nthe important conversations"},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"you have live, all the files\nyou've shared live as well."},"902":{"dur":4,"text":"So we've indexed all that and\nmade it completely searchable."},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"So when I want to\nsearch, just click"},"909":{"dur":1,"text":"on the little Search button."},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"And we know through all of our\nDrive research and our Gmail"},"913":{"dur":1,"text":"research, you can never\nremember the file name"},"915":{"dur":1,"text":"of a file someone\nshared with you,"},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"or ever remember the\nsubject line of an email."},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"But you always have those other\nlittle nuggets of information,"},"921":{"dur":5,"text":"like who sent the file, or\nwhat kind of thing they sent."},"927":{"dur":2,"text":"So while you can\nsearch for keyword,"},"929":{"dur":1,"text":"what we've seen in\nour trusted testers,"},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"many people actually just search\nby person or search by type."},"935":{"dur":3,"text":"So when I want to, I can\nget back to that document"},"938":{"dur":4,"text":"that I just posted earlier\nand the room itself."},"943":{"dur":0,"text":"Cool."},"944":{"dur":1,"text":"Can we switch back\nto demo, please?"},"949":{"dur":5,"text":"So we know that with chat apps,\nnotifications can be a problem."},"955":{"dur":2,"text":"So we want to make sure\nyou don't feel like you're"},"957":{"dur":2,"text":"working all the time."},"960":{"dur":3,"text":"We have very granular chat\ncontrols, to let you dial up"},"964":{"dur":2,"text":"or dial down the notifications\nto as much as you want."},"966":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you want to be in\nthe loop all the time,"},"968":{"dur":1,"text":"you
