example, 'cause this is a"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"long term infrastructure\ninvestment..."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"So as we look at 2016\nfor example, or 2018"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"or 2014 in

funding."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we have\nappropriations and then"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"you can no longer do a federal\nappropriation year mark."},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"And so then we approached\nthe state of Minnesota"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"for bond funds, which\nstarted in 2006."},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"We've received smaller\namounts each year,"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"but certainly sizable\nenough to do a project."},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think it's about 11\nmillion, roughly 15 million,"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"somewhere in there\nthat we've received"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"of bond funds to date."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"The total of that has been\ninvested in federal estate"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"dollars so far as 29
