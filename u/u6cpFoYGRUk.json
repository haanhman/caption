people"},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"scattered around the world\nthat had to be coordinated to"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"make these goods and services\nin these large

and"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"our customers,\nCEOs at other events."},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"People get that\nthis is a problem,"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"I hear that this is\na recurring theme,

recognize"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"that their own organizational\nstructures and"},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"ways of acting are part\nof the problem."},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"So that brings up the question,"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"well, why don't they fix it,\nright?"},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"These are leaders of\nlarge organizations,"},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"many of you in the room,

actually"},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"really good at\naddressing challenges,"},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"they rise to challenges,\nthey like it."},"782":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think the real problem\nhere is that it's much harder"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"to break old habits than\nit is to build new ones."},"789":{"dur":4,"text":"And so many of the very things\nthat made people successful"},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"in the first three of the\nindustrial revolutions, things"},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"like being decisive and being\ndirective were things that were"},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"celebrated, and they helped make\npeople successful in this world."},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"But driving innovation actually\nmeans giving up control."},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me go back to\nthe orchestra analogy."},"813":{"dur":4,"text":"Itay Talgam also once said, the\nworst damage that I can do to my"},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"orchestra is give them\nclear instructions."},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"That would prevent the ensemble,"},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"the listening to each other\nthat's needed for an orchestra."},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"It starts with recognizing\nthat innovation"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"rarely comes from the boardroom\nor the executive suite."},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"It comes from much\ncloser to the customer,"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"where things are happening,\nwhere the action is."},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"And recognizing that is\na critical component to"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"rethinking how we\norganize to innovate."},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"It actually is even harder than\nthat, because we can talk about"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"that in the context of\nany one organization."},"858":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think we see over and\nover and"},"860":{"dur":4,"text":"over again, individual\norganizations aren't enough."},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"No matter how big the company,\nthere are more smart people"},"868":{"dur":4,"text":"outside the company than\nthere are inside the
