of contact,"},"358":{"dur":4,"text":"the first phase of funding, the first step of really looking at local economic growth,"},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"is in that community."},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we\u2019re not bringing something to them, we\u2019re taking something from out of them"},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"and expanding and growing it and making it more prosperous"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"and putting them on a pathway to prosperity."},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we really talk about being African led,"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"being demand driven and being first mile

Blair?"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, at the Cherie Blair Foundation,"},"386":{"dur":4,"text":"we believe that if we empower women so that they can have their own money,"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"then they can make their own choices."},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we work with women entrepreneurs,"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"small and medium size business people,"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"who want to grow and expand their businesses"},"403":{"dur":5,"text":"and we do that by doing what we say is looking at the three C\u2019s."},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"We believe that a woman entrepreneur needs three things."},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"She needs confidence and I don\u2019t need to tell you all here"},"416":{"dur":4,"text":"that so many parts of the world, including even in this country,"},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"women are often told what they can\u2019t do rather than what they can do,"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"and so confidence is a really important part of that."},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"So, our programs always help with women's confidence."},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"We then look at the women's capacity,"},"434":{"dur":5,"text":"so we do a huge amount of business training, financial literacy training,"},"439":{"dur":6,"text":"to help women get those skills which are not necessarily naturally acquired."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"Many of the women who work do have natural talent,"},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"whether it\u2019s in the fashion industry or in science and technology,"},"453":{"dur":6,"text":"or engineering, or medicine even, but they don\u2019t necessarily have the business skills."},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"It\u2019s one thing to know how to deliver a service"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"and it\u2019s another thing to know how to read a balance sheet,"},"465":{"dur":4,"text":"and so we do a lot of business skills training, that's our second C."},"470":{"dur":4,"text":"And our third C, and the most difficult one to crack, is access to capital."},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"Because we live in a world where if you want ten dollars"},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"then these days micro-financing is going to find a solution for you."},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you want ten million, or more,"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"then venture capital will probably find a solution for you."},"489":{"dur":4,"text":"If you want twenty five, fifty, even a hundred thousand"},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"to grow and expand your business,"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"which is probably already employing 10-15 people,"},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"but you want to take it to the next level, it\u2019s very difficult to get that capital."},"504":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, we are constantly devising and looking for ways to help our women"},"509":{"dur":5,"text":"entrepreneurs raise capital and because we believe that"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"if you\u2019re talking about development then you\u2019re talking about"},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"empowering women to drive the expansion of their businesses."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"So they\u2019re not only employing their own families"},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"and helping their own families"},"527":{"dur":4,"text":"but they really are providing job opportunities for men and women,"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"boys and girls, in their communities."},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"And we have three different ways of doing that, three programs,"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"because our programs are driven by technology."},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"Because in the 21st century, technology can help us reach people"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"we haven\u2019t been able to reach before,"},"548":{"dur":4,"text":"give them access to information that\u2019s been inaccessible to them before,"},"552":{"dur":5,"text":"and to link people across the world, to make transactions,"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"to help each other ,to loan money to each other."},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"So that\u2019s what we do."},"562":{"dur":5,"text":"So, our first program is our Global Mentoring Platform and this is a platform,"},"567":{"dur":5,"text":"where we reach out to women who are having businesses and employing people."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"They have to have access to the Internet,"},"574":{"dur":4,"text":"which in many parts of the world of course can be difficult,"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"and they have to be able to speak English."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"So we\u2019re not talking about bottom of the pyramid women here,"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"we\u2019re talking about women with enterprises"},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"and we match these women with men and women mentors all over the world."},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"So, to date we\u2019re in over a hundred countries"},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"because we partner with local NGO\u2019s who are doing business training"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"and we offer them this service."},"600":{"dur":6,"text":"An add-on service which is a year's mentoring, whereby the woman is given a mentor,"},"606":{"dur":5,"text":"who for two hours a month will help them on their business journey, with a specific plan."},"611":{"dur":5,"text":"And we have built a worldwide community there, which not only is a dating service,"},"617":{"dur":6,"text":"is actually a community, which talks with each other and works and supports each other."},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"Then our next program is what we call our Enterprise Development Programs"},"626":{"dur":4,"text":"and this is much more face-to-face, on the ground business training,"},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"financial literacy training, which we do in different geographies"},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"and in that program we\u2019ve developed our blended learning approach,"},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"which again, uses technology to enable women entrepreneurs"},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"to be able to get the sort of access to the business skills training they need,"},"648":{"dur":4,"text":"without having to give up and huge chunks of time away from their business."},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"And we\u2019ve found that that\u2019s has been very, very successful"},"656":{"dur":5,"text":"because women like that flexibility, that a combination of some face to face training"},"662":{"dur":5,"text":"and a lot of other training delivered over technology, really works."},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"And then our third program, is our Mobile Phone Program, which is aimed much more,"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"at towards the bottom of the pyramid women,"},"675":{"dur":5,"text":"providing basic skills training and information to help women"},"680":{"dur":4,"text":"by using the mobile phone, either to learn business skills,"},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"possibly to develop a small business"},"687":{"dur":4,"text":"around selling mobile phone time or mobile money services."},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"And finally, we\u2019ve developed a number of apps"},"695":{"dur":6,"text":"which just make life easier for women who have got small businesses,"},"702":{"dur":4,"text":"by using their mobile phone to give them advantage of technology."},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"So, that\u2019s what we do."},"708":{"dur":0,"text":"Charlotte?"},"711":{"dur":0,"text":"Good morning."},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"I lead the, what we call, \u20185by20 Initiative\u2019 at Coca-Cola,"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"which is our Women's Economic Empowerment Initiative."},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"We made a global commitment to enable the economic empowerment"},"725":{"dur":5,"text":"of  five million women entrepreneurs across our global value chain by 2020"},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"and this was a commitment we made at the end of 2010."},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"So, as you think about Coca-Cola Company,"},"741":{"dur":4,"text":"it\u2019s obviously very well known for its global brands and it\u2019s a global company,"},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"but actually the way we operate is very, very local business."},"747":{"dur":6,"text":"So, as we look at that, we want to hire people locally,"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"we all live and work in the local community,"},"756":{"dur":5,"text":"so it\u2019s really, really important to us that the community is thriving,"},"761":{"dur":6,"text":"it\u2019s sustainable and that\u2019s critical for, obviously, us as a business to grow,"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"and so the two go hand in hand."},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we see women as being absolutely critical to that."},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"Women are not only the pillars of the local community"},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"but we all know that if you can, as Cherie has said,"},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"if you can enable a woman to actually earn her own livelihood, have her own business,"},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"then the ripple effect of that is enormous on the community"},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"and it\u2019s not just the woman who benefits but it\u2019s her family,"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"her children then are able to go to school because she invests in them,"},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"she spends in the local economy."},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"So, there\u2019s this massive ripple effect"},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"and obviously that\u2019s good for businesses to then operate in that community."},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"So, that\u2019s the reason we believe this is so important."},"807":{"dur":5,"text":"And as from a business perspective, the critical thing,"},"813":{"dur":5,"text":"I think from my perspective, is that it is looking across those small businesses,"},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"that we would have the opportunity to touch and that might not be a business yet,"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"it might be helping women to set up businesses from scratch"},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"or it may be helping her to grow one that she already has."},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"And we look at it right across what we would call our value chain,"},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"so it starts with smallholder farmers that might be growing fruit"},"836":{"dur":4,"text":"or any kind of crop that we might be able to take into our beverages at some point."},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"It could be any kind of supplier."},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"It could be a distributor."},"845":{"dur":4,"text":"In Africa, we have committed to say fifty percent of all new distributors must be women."},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"We look at small neighborhood stores,"},"854":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, the small businesses which are very popular for women to set up"},"858":{"dur":5,"text":"because it\u2019s close to home, it\u2019s not in an area that's unsafe for them to go into"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"and they sell things in the local community."},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"We also look at recycling businesses and waste picking businesses"},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"and we also look at artisan businesses"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"that make things from recycled beverage packaging,"},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"often combining them with indigenous materials."},"880":{"dur":6,"text":"So, many different kinds because we are so global but so local,"},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"we do work very much at the bottom of the pyramid"},"890":{"dur":3,"text":"and I believe that linking it to the business,"},"894":{"dur":3,"text":"so that we can help those businesses grow,"},"898":{"dur":3,"text":"is actually the way to make it truly sustainable."},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"And Charlotte, you\u2019re even actually wearing one of your artisan\u2019s\u2026?"},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"I am, yeah this is made from recycled plastic bottles from the Amazon,"},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"from one of  our artisans in the Amazon."},"911":{"dur":0,"text":"Bart?"},"913":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you, good morning."},"915":{"dur":5,"text":"So, B-Lab\u2019s a non-profit, we\u2019re trying to directly the address the question of this panel:"},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"How do we get business more engaged in alleviating poverty,"},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"addressing inequality, addressing climate change?"},"928":{"dur":4,"text":"Our approach is pretty straightforward, we\u2019re trying to redefine success in business,"},"932":{"dur":3,"text":"we believe in a generation's time there needs to be a different way"},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"we all think about what success means."},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"It\u2019s going to lead to require companies not just being best in the world"},"944":{"dur":1,"text":"but best for the world."},"945":{"dur":3,"text":"To get there, there\u2019s going to need to be some infrastructure put in place."},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"The first is, we need new metrics, right?"},"952":{"dur":5,"text":"As we think about business, it needs to not just be about financial accomplishments,"},"957":{"dur":3,"text":"it needs to include community engagement,"},"961":{"dur":2,"text":"worker involvement and environmental footprint."},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"Those need to be included in what we think about as a successful business."},"969":{"dur":4,"text":"Secondly, the truth is, if we want different outcomes from business,"},"974":{"dur":1,"text":"we\u2019ve got to change the rules,"},"975":{"dur":2,"text":"and that means we need to address shareholder primacy."},"978":{"dur":3,"text":"And so for us, that means a new legal framework,"},"982":{"dur":3,"text":"that requires companies to create not only value for their shareholders,"},"986":{"dur":1,"text":"but also for society and the environment."},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"And then third and finally, we have to address transparency."},"991":{"dur":1,"text":"Companies need to be transparent,"},"993":{"dur":1,"text":"not just about their financial results"},"994":{"dur":2,"text":"but also about their social and environmental impact."},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"Our theory of change, again, pretty straightforward."},"1000":{"dur":3,"text":"We find leaders, best in class companies, we give them an identity,"},"1003":{"dur":1,"text":"we call them Certified B Corporations."},"1005":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019m sure almost everybody here is familiar with Fair Trade."},"1009":{"dur":3,"text":"Fair Trade is to coffee what Certified B Corp is to a good business."},"1013":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, really simply."},"1014":{"dur":3,"text":"To be certified, you\u2019ve got to demonstrate the highest standards"},"1018":{"dur":2,"text":"of social and environmental performance as evidenced"},"1021":{"dur":2,"text":"through something called our B Impact Assessment."},"1023":{"dur":4,"text":"Secondly, you\u2019ve got to embed in the actual governance of the company,"},"1028":{"dur":2,"text":"a commitment to stakeholders, so it\u2019s in the DNA of the business."},"1030":{"dur":2,"text":"And then third and finally, you need to be transparent with your results."},"1033":{"dur":4,"text":"We have about 2,100 Certified B Corporations in 54 different countries,"},"1038":{"dur":1,"text":"over 150 different industries."},"1040":{"dur":3,"text":"Commonality, they\u2019re all using business as a force for good."},"1044":{"dur":2,"text":"Our objective, after identifying these leaders,"},"1046":{"dur":2,"text":"is then to provide easy tools for others to follow."},"1048":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the impact assessment we use for the certification,"},"1051":{"dur":3,"text":"it\u2019s free, it\u2019s a public good, anybody can use, it includes case studies,"},"1055":{"dur":1,"text":"best practice guidelines etcetera."},"1057":{"dur":4,"text":"We have about 60,000 companies using that tool as an internal management tool,"},"1061":{"dur":1,"text":"to try to be more impactful."},"1063":{"dur":2,"text":"The second scaling tool for us, allowing companies"},"1066":{"dur":4,"text":"to follow the lead of the community, is a new legal framework."},"1070":{"dur":7,"text":"It\u2019s literally a new legal type of corporation, it\u2019s called the Benefit Corp.  Okay?"},"1077":{"dur":4,"text":"We have passed now in 32 states in the United States and about six months ago in Italy."},"1082":{"dur":3,"text":"There are eight countries that are considering it currently."},"1085":{"dur":5,"text":"It was recommended by the G7 for all countries to adopt this new legal entity."},"1091":{"dur":3,"text":"So, think traditional corporation, think non-profit, and then sitting next to it,"},"1094":{"dur":2,"text":"something called the Benefit Corp that requires a company"},"1097":{"dur":3,"text":"to create shareholder value and social value simultaneously."},"1101":{"dur":3,"text":"Those two pieces work together to try to allow companies"},"1104":{"dur":2,"text":"to follow the lead of the community as Certified B Corp."},"1106":{"dur":3,"text":"The long term objective, as I said, is to redefine success in business"},"1110":{"dur":3,"text":"so that we\u2019re getting a shared and durable prosperity through the business community."},"1113":{"dur":8,"text":"Now you know what our panelists do, I\u2019m interested in what was learned along the way."},"1121":{"dur":2,"text":"Not stories of failure but stories of adaptation."},"1125":{"dur":6,"text":"Plans are, I mean, smart people make plans and then they go in and, like war plans,"},"1132":{"dur":2,"text":"they sometimes don\u2019t survive the first shot."},"1135":{"dur":6,"text":"There are things that you have to change, modify, reshape to local conditions."},"1142":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019m wondering if in all your cases there have been times where something that"},"1146":{"dur":3,"text":"looked great on paper, needed to be adapted"},"1150":{"dur":3,"text":"because of things that you just don\u2019t know until you\u2019re actually doing it?"},"1154":{"dur":0,"text":"I\u2019ll start."},"1155":{"dur":3,"text":"One of the things, I think, in the philanthropic space"},"1159":{"dur":5,"text":"and looking at grant funding, because you make a grant therefore you are good."},"1164":{"dur":2,"text":"And that sort of, that, we have money"},"1167":{"dur":2,"text":"and we make grants to poor and vulnerable people"},"1169":{"dur":3,"text":"in hard to reach under-served communities, in the Horn of Africa,"},"1173":{"dur":2,"text":"in the Sahel, in the Great Lakes region."},"1175":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we make a grant to an organization,"},"1178":{"dur":4,"text":"we link them with technical assistance and therefore we\u2019ve done good in the world."},"1182":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the things coming into this role is,"},"1185":{"dur":3,"text":"we had to do some critical analysis about what are we really trying to do?"},"1188":{"dur":2,"text":"Are we trying to make grants or are we trying to make change?"},"1191":{"dur":2,"text":"And if we\u2019re trying to make change we need to be intentional"},"1194":{"dur":2,"text":"in a very different way and so we started structuring our grant"},"1197":{"dur":2,"text":"making around a first phase of funding."},"1199":{"dur":2,"text":"A phased approach, really again that first mile,"},"1202":{"dur":2,"text":"that first phase of funding, your operational assistance."},"1204":{"dur":3,"text":"And taking an agricultural co-operative and saying, your governance structure,"},"1208":{"dur":4,"text":"your books in order, your financial management tool, some operational assistance."},"1212":{"dur":3,"text":"And then there\u2019s the next phase of funding and really about enterprise expansion."},"1216":{"dur":3,"text":"And for years, we sort of did operational assistance,"},"1219":{"dur":2,"text":"we did enterprise expansion, and we would stop."},"1222":{"dur":1,"text":"So then I come along and I start saying,"},"1223":{"dur":2,"text":"\u201cThis is great, what do we have in this in this agency?\u201d"},"1226":{"dur":5,"text":"We have 500 community enterprises, social enterprises throughout Africa."},"1232":{"dur":6,"text":"And tough places, Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Somalia, DRC,"},"1238":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, really tough places."},"1239":{"dur":2,"text":"And we\u2019re doing these grants and we are doing operational assistance,"},"1242":{"dur":1,"text":"we\u2019re doing enterprise expansion."},"1243":{"dur":3,"text":"And I said, \u201cGreat, 500, sixty million invested in them, just great."},"1247":{"dur":1,"text":"Where are the winners?"},"1248":{"dur":3,"text":"Who are the ones that are really linking to follow-on funding, or linking to others?\u201d"},"1253":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, it was like this room, it was crickets."},"1255":{"dur":2,"text":"They were like, \u201cOh, they have to go somewhere?\u201d"},"1258":{"dur":4,"text":"I said,  \u201cWe have a tag line that says \u2018Creating Pathways to Prosperity\u2019,"},"1262":{"dur":1,"text":"what\u2019s the pathway?\u201d"},"1264":{"dur":2,"text":"And we had to really get smarter around saying,"},"1267":{"dur":3,"text":"you know, we\u2019re in an educational institution, so let\u2019s say it like this,"},"1271":{"dur":3,"text":"we help them through high school and we even get them to college,"},"1274":{"dur":4,"text":"but every college predicates its success, and where their graduates go,"},"1279":{"dur":1,"text":"and how much money they make."},"1281":{"dur":4,"text":"So, where did our grantees, these early stage investees,"},"1286":{"dur":3,"text":"these agricultural off-grid energy, youth enterprises,"},"1289":{"dur":1,"text":"where did they go after we stopped?"},"1291":{"dur":1,"text":"And we didn\u2019t have answers for that."},"1292":{"dur":3,"text":"So we had to think about really adapting our model and saying,"},"1295":{"dur":4,"text":"we probably need to find out what Cherie Blair Foundation,"},"1300":{"dur":3,"text":"what Coca-Cola and others are looking for, so when we leave,"},"1304":{"dur":4,"text":"when we stop our funding, and go and find and let another thousand flowers bloom,"},"1308":{"dur":0,"text":"that we\u2019re linking them together."},"1309":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we had to create a new sort of level to really think about a real continuum,"},"1314":{"dur":1,"text":"and it was sort of a eureka moment."},"1316":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it was like, you know, we\u2019re making grants,"},"1318":{"dur":1,"text":"we feel really good about ourselves,"},"1319":{"dur":2,"text":"we can say in volume how many grants we\u2019re making,"},"1322":{"dur":1,"text":"and we even look at revenue generation,"},"1324":{"dur":6,"text":"but we didn\u2019t really think about these organizations that have a pathway,"},"1330":{"dur":2,"text":"a continuum, to really keep increasing."},"1332":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was, again, it was a moment in time where we said,"},"1335":{"dur":4,"text":"it\u2019s about what we do, but it\u2019s about what happens after we stop doing,"},"1340":{"dur":2,"text":"and that\u2019s really one way that we had to adapt."},"1344":{"dur":0,"text":"Who\u2019s next?"},"1346":{"dur":1,"text":"Shall we just go down the line?"},"1349":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019m very interested in what you said because  before I started the Foundation,"},"1354":{"dur":5,"text":"for ten years in Downing Street, every week I did a charitable reception"},"1360":{"dur":3,"text":"and saw loads of charities, both nationally and internationally,"},"1364":{"dur":3,"text":"and it did strike me sometimes that there was a lot of duplication going on"},"1368":{"dur":3,"text":"and sometimes just a lot of things continuing"},"1371":{"dur":1,"text":"because that\u2019s just what we\u2019ve always done."},"1373":{"dur":3,"text":"And so when I set up the Foundation I was very clear that we needed to make sure"},"1377":{"dur":2,"text":"that everything we did, there was a reason for it,"},"1379":{"dur":4,"text":"and at the end that we always worked out, did it actually work?"},"1383":{"dur":4,"text":"Because if it doesn\u2019t work, you should stop doing it and try and do something else."},"1388":{"dur":3,"text":"And so with all our programs, we\u2019ve just,"},"1392":{"dur":3,"text":"last year we did an analysis of our mentoring program"},"1395":{"dur":3,"text":"and we got an independent class of work associates"},"1398":{"dur":3,"text":"to assess whether actually remote mentoring really works."},"1402":{"dur":4,"text":"Fortunately, they gave us the thumbs up, so that was good."},"1407":{"dur":5,"text":"With our mobile phone programs, we did this Business Woman\u2019s App"},"1413":{"dur":6,"text":"where we reached over 70,000 women in Nigeria and 100,000 women"},"1420":{"dur":3,"text":"overall in Tanzania, Nigeria and Indonesia."},"1423":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, but again, does it make any difference sending a woman a text message,"},"1427":{"dur":2,"text":"as we were doing, four text messages a week,"},"1429":{"dur":2,"text":"and helping her with business hints and tips?"},"1432":{"dur":7,"text":"So, we got the Michigan State University to do an analysis of that and they found,"},"1440":{"dur":3,"text":"first of all, it did make a difference, but secondly,"},"1443":{"dur":4,"text":"that there was a huge desire for us to provide them with further services."},"1447":{"dur":5,"text":"So, yes it\u2019s good to have information delivered where you are,"},"1452":{"dur":1,"text":"so that you can look at it at the time."},"1454":{"dur":2,"text":"It was amazing how many of those women then shared it with others."},"1457":{"dur":2,"text":"But they really wanted some more inter-connectivity,"},"1460":{"dur":4,"text":"so that they could ask more questions, rather than just being told things."},"1464":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we\u2019ve moved on to our phase two now that we\u2019re doing"},"1467":{"dur":3,"text":"and we\u2019re doing that in Mexico and that\u2019s called, She Ventures."},"1470":{"dur":6,"text":"And She Ventures is now moving from 2G mobile phone text messaging"},"1477":{"dur":6,"text":"onto a web-based service, which is more widely available and which will enable us,"},"1484":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, sometimes even to do little videos"},"1486":{"dur":6,"text":"or allow much more interchange between the people who are using the platform."},"1493":{"dur":5,"text":"So again, our ideas have developed because of this."},"1499":{"dur":2,"text":"Our Blended Learning Program that we\u2019re doing at the moment,"},"1502":{"dur":4,"text":"we\u2019ve done thanks to Exxon Mobil in Nigeria,"},"1507":{"dur":4,"text":"and another program that we\u2019ve done in Malaysia, with the help of Qualcomm,"},"1511":{"dur":6,"text":"where we gave small tablet computers to groups of women entrepreneurs there"},"1518":{"dur":3,"text":"and free access to the internet and they came onto our mentoring program."},"1521":{"dur":4,"text":"We\u2019ve had them independently assessed to see, well, does it work,"},"1526":{"dur":1,"text":"what can we do better?"},"1527":{"dur":6,"text":"But just  as a small example, in our Enterprise Development Program,"},"1534":{"dur":2,"text":"we\u2019ve developed this business skills training for women,"},"1537":{"dur":5,"text":"which we did in Palestine and we were doing in parts of the Lebanon,"},"1542":{"dur":2,"text":"then we moved up to the Bekaa Valley."},"1545":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, we\u2019ve got our local partners, started delivering,"},"1548":{"dur":5,"text":"and of course in the Bekaa Valley, there\u2019s huge issues with what is going on in Syria."},"1554":{"dur":4,"text":"And, you know, we found that working with the women there,"},"1558":{"dur":2,"text":"when you\u2019re talking about business training"},"1561":{"dur":2,"text":"and you\u2019re talking about developing business planning,"},"1563":{"dur":2,"text":"you have to be able to think about what\u2019s going to happen,"},"1565":{"dur":4,"text":"not just next week, but next month and next year."},"1570":{"dur":4,"text":"Working with these women, where they\u2019re in such a precarious,"},"1574":{"dur":3,"text":"fragile community, they could barely think about"},"1578":{"dur":1,"text":"what was going to happen tomorrow,"},"1580":{"dur":4,"text":"and so we had to really change the way we worked our program,"},"1584":{"dur":5,"text":"to be able to help these women start to begin to believe that"},"1590":{"dur":3,"text":"they could think a little bit more than just what was going to happen"},"1594":{"dur":1,"text":"in the next twenty four hours."},"1596":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that was that was a learning experience."},"1598":{"dur":4,"text":"Another example, I said with our mobile phones,"},"1602":{"dur":5,"text":"we did this whole work with mobile phone companies and banks."},"1608":{"dur":2,"text":"We did it in three countries in particular."},"1611":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we were doing is we were giving business training to women"},"1614":{"dur":3,"text":"and at the end they were given by the mobile phone company,"},"1617":{"dur":4,"text":"a contract to enable them to sell, then become mobile money agents."},"1622":{"dur":3,"text":"I don\u2019t need to explain to you, I hope, what happens with the mobile money."},"1626":{"dur":5,"text":"But to do that you have to first buy your block of mobile phone time,"},"1632":{"dur":2,"text":"and so we\u2019d entered into deals with local banks,"},"1636":{"dur":5,"text":"to allow the women when they\u2019d been trained, to go and get credit from the banks."},"1641":{"dur":4,"text":"It worked really well in two geographies  but in one country in Africa,"},"1646":{"dur":5,"text":"we had abysmal success, well, not abysmal, but you know, the rates of take up."},"1652":{"dur":2,"text":"So we train all these women but, you know, less than 30% of them"},"1655":{"dur":2,"text":"were actually getting the loans that the bank had promised."},"1658":{"dur":5,"text":"And we realized that you have to, it\u2019s not enough to have the local bank,"},"1663":{"dur":5,"text":"the CEO and the Board, say, \u201cOh yes we\u2019re going to commit to this.\u201d"},"1668":{"dur":3,"text":"Because what was happening is, whatever they were saying up in Head Office,"},"1673":{"dur":4,"text":"at local level, the mainly male finance officers,"},"1678":{"dur":3,"text":"just couldn\u2019t get their head round the idea that giving"},"1682":{"dur":4,"text":"any loan at all to a woman was anything other than a big risk."},"1687":{"dur":3,"text":"So, that taught us that nearly ever since then,"},"1691":{"dur":6,"text":"you know, when we do enter into an agreement with banks like this,"},"1697":{"dur":4,"text":"we have to also make sure that the bank is actually going to transmit"},"1702":{"dur":4,"text":"this message down to the people who are delivering the service, you know."},"1707":{"dur":3,"text":"And that\u2019s about making sure that people have incentives,"},"1710":{"dur":4,"text":"that they are judged on how many loans they give to women,"},"1714":{"dur":3,"text":"that they\u2019re trained in why women actually are a good risk,"},"1717":{"dur":2,"text":"better risk than men in many cases."},"1720":{"dur":5,"text":"So, all the time you are learning and you have to adapt"},"1725":{"dur":5,"text":"because that\u2019s just the way of life, we\u2019re all learning every day aren\u2019t we?"},"1733":{"dur":3,"text":"I think the one thing I\u2019ve learned is to be a bit more patient."},"1739":{"dur":3,"text":"I think when you come from the business side,"},"1743":{"dur":4,"text":"you expect to get fast results and you want to get fast results,"},"1747":{"dur":2,"text":"because you want to reach many, many more people."},"1750":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think I\u2019ve learned that you really need,"},"1754":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, obviously, we do not do this on our own,"},"1756":{"dur":4,"text":"you have to have absolutely the right partners around the table"},"1760":{"dur":3,"text":"to really make sure that what you collectively want to achieve,"},"1764":{"dur":4,"text":"A) can be done, and that you each bring your unique skills to the table,"},"1769":{"dur":1,"text":"to be able to affect that change."},"1773":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, one example, I think is, you know,"},"1775":{"dur":3,"text":"of learning that we\u2019ve had that has been scalable,"},"1779":{"dur":3,"text":"because I came into this thinking we could always design everything for scale,"},"1782":{"dur":2,"text":"because that\u2019s the background I come from,"},"1785":{"dur":3,"text":"and I believed that we could make a huge difference to do that."},"1788":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think in many instances we\u2019ve been successful in doing that"},"1791":{"dur":2,"text":"and starting to design by scale right from the beginning,"},"1794":{"dur":3,"text":"and in others you hit major roadblocks and you find that actually,"},"1798":{"dur":3,"text":"what has worked in one country just does not translate,"},"1801":{"dur":3,"text":"however strong the framework might be."},"1805":{"dur":4,"text":"There\u2019s either cultural complexities, or there are operational issues on the ground,"},"1809":{"dur":4,"text":"or just education is different or habits are different, something has shifted."},"1815":{"dur":5,"text":"I think the things that I\u2019ve learned have really worked where,"},"1820":{"dur":7,"text":"for example, we worked in Kenya and Uganda with TechnoServe"},"1828":{"dur":9,"text":"and with the Gates Foundation to actually train over 50,000 fruit farmers,"},"1838":{"dur":3,"text":"mango farmers and passion fruit farmers, but particularly mango farmers,"},"1841":{"dur":5,"text":"to actually learn how to get better yields from their mango trees."},"1847":{"dur":4,"text":"We were looking for, obviously we wanted a local source of quality supply,"},"1852":{"dur":4,"text":"to be able to use in our juice drinks but also help create broader market access"},"1856":{"dur":2,"text":"for those mango farmers and we really wanted them"},"1859":{"dur":2,"text":"to significantly increase their income."},"1863":{"dur":7,"text":"We were successful collectively in actually their income increased 140%."},"1871":{"dur":3,"text":"We were able to source those juices locally,"},"1875":{"dur":2,"text":"actually produce local brands from that,"},"1877":{"dur":3,"text":"Minute Maid Mango Juice was launched in Kenya."},"1882":{"dur":3,"text":"And that model, and what we learned through that,"},"1885":{"dur":2,"text":"has then informed projects in other places."},"1887":{"dur":4,"text":"We now have a major project in India working with the Jain Corporation"},"1892":{"dur":4,"text":"on mango fruit farming to help really make sure we\u2019ve got strong quality local supply,"},"1897":{"dur":3,"text":"but equally those small farmers are learning from that."},"1901":{"dur":2,"text":"And we have trained men and women farmers,"},"1904":{"dur":3,"text":"but we always make sure that there\u2019s a very strong percentage"},"1908":{"dur":2,"text":"of women farmers as part of that program."},"1910":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think, you know, similar to Cherie\u2019s experience on technology,"},"1915":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, what we seek to do always is either provide business building skills"},"1920":{"dur":4,"text":"for that particular business, also, access to finance,"},"1924":{"dur":2,"text":"and also, access to mentors and peer networks."},"1926":{"dur":3,"text":"It\u2019s sometimes one of those things or it can be all of those things."},"1931":{"dur":4,"text":"One of the things we\u2019ve done recently, also in Indonesia,"},"1935":{"dur":3,"text":"is we took what we had designed for scale,"},"1939":{"dur":5,"text":"which was taking all of the knowledge from training small retail businesses"},"1944":{"dur":3,"text":"into a modularized approach of 30 modules,"},"1948":{"dur":6,"text":"and we tried to take it down to bite=size chunks for mobile technology."},"1955":{"dur":5,"text":"We worked with the GSMA to look at what the different technological penetration"},"1961":{"dur":6,"text":"was in different markets and we knew that it was low for apps"},"1967":{"dur":4,"text":"in somewhere like Indonesia because they are still working off SMS, as you said."},"1973":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we went in thinking it was about 35% penetration but actually it was much lower,"},"1978":{"dur":4,"text":"it was more like about 19%, so you have to adapt all the time."},"1982":{"dur":4,"text":"And we\u2019re also working now with Malaysia, which obviously,"},"1987":{"dur":2,"text":"they need a completely different application"},"1989":{"dur":1,"text":"because they have very high smart phone."},"1991":{"dur":5,"text":"So, how you adapt the content to be relevant and to reach women"},"1996":{"dur":6,"text":"who are wanting the technology, but most important,"},"2003":{"dur":1,"text":"they\u2019re wanting to have their capacity built,"},"2004":{"dur":2,"text":"to actually get that learning in a way that\u2019s safe,"},"2007":{"dur":3,"text":"is easy for them to understand, and enables them to be successful."},"2011":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you\u2019re adapting constantly with your partners along the way."},"2016":{"dur":2,"text":"Picking up on a similar thing."},"2019":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we\u2019re trying to build a global movement of people using business as a force for good."},"2023":{"dur":2,"text":"Very quickly we learn that local context is everything,"},"2027":{"dur":5,"text":"that if we\u2019re truly going to try to drive a new way of doing business"},"2032":{"dur":4,"text":"we have to make sure that it doesn\u2019t, or isn\u2019t perceived as an American export."},"2038":{"dur":1,"text":"Dead in the water."},"2039":{"dur":1,"text":"Literally dead in the water."},"2040":{"dur":3,"text":"And what that means is we\u2019ve got to work with local non-profits"},"2044":{"dur":3,"text":"on the ground in each of our markets, who are driving this movement."},"2048":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we partner with sister non-profits,"},"2052":{"dur":6,"text":"Sistema B Latin America, B-Lab UK, B-Lab Europe, B-Lab East Africa,"},"2058":{"dur":5,"text":"all of whom understand local context are staffed with local people,"},"2064":{"dur":3,"text":"and we talk about this as a global movement with local execution."},"2069":{"dur":2,"text":"That also then applies down to our standards,"},"2071":{"dur":3,"text":"right, we\u2019re a standards organization but we need to make sure"},"2075":{"dur":2,"text":"the standards fit that context."},"2078":{"dur":1,"text":"That\u2019s incredibly challenging, right,"},"2079":{"dur":3,"text":"we\u2019re already trying to measure the impact of a company on all of its stakeholders,"},"2083":{"dur":3,"text":"governance, consumers, community, environment, consumers."},"2087":{"dur":3,"text":"What it means currently, is we have 72 different versions of our assessment,"},"2091":{"dur":3,"text":"depending upon how big you are, where you\u2019re located, and what your industry is."},"2095":{"dur":1,"text":"So, that was one major learning."},"2096":{"dur":5,"text":"The second major learning, if you\u2019re trying to move business to a higher plane,"},"2102":{"dur":6,"text":"to a higher use, you have to recognize that even if you have the business leader"},"2108":{"dur":4,"text":"or the entrepreneur on board, even if you have the at the asset owners,"},"2112":{"dur":2,"text":"meaning the people who actually own the stock,"},"2114":{"dur":2,"text":"and even consumers and workers, everybody\u2019s on board,"},"2118":{"dur":3,"text":"there\u2019s these intermediaries that are in the center"},"2122":{"dur":3,"text":"and the intermediaries are incredibly difficult to move."},"2126":{"dur":3,"text":"Think attorneys, think investment managers,"},"2130":{"dur":4,"text":"think bankers and this is, I\u2019m not being majorative\u2014"},"2134":{"dur":1,"text":"You are being mean about lawyers now\u2014"},"2137":{"dur":3,"text":"Honestly I\u2019m not, but almost every one of those"},"2141":{"dur":3,"text":"intermediaries exist to mitigate risk, right?"},"2145":{"dur":7,"text":"That is their business and if we don\u2019t massively change and educate,"},"2152":{"dur":4,"text":"attorneys, bankers, investors on the need for business"},"2156":{"dur":1,"text":"to get more engaged in this problem"},"2158":{"dur":4,"text":"and it will deeply impact the acceleration of this movement, it\u2019s just critical."},"2163":{"dur":4,"text":"Totally, I totally agree as a lawyer myself and as someone,"},"2167":{"dur":2,"text":"I\u2019m just thinking, I wonder if I can make my law firm at B Corp."},"2170":{"dur":0,"text":"You can."},"2172":{"dur":2,"text":"Even when we\u2019re only an LLP?"},"2175":{"dur":0,"text":"You can."},"2176":{"dur":0,"text":"We\u2019ll talk later."},"2177":{"dur":3,"text":"But you know, I really think we have to change lawyers"},"2181":{"dur":3,"text":"from being perceived as the people who tell you what you can\u2019t do,"},"2185":{"dur":4,"text":"into people who tell you how you can do what it is you want to do,"},"2189":{"dur":4,"text":"and that it\u2019s really, really, important that we use that imagination"},"2194":{"dur":4,"text":"and skill of the lawyer in a positive, enabling way, so you know,"},"2199":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019m actually all in favor of that."},"2202":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, I will try to avoid using lawyers as a stand in for the word \u2018no\u2019,"},"2209":{"dur":3,"text":"but at the same time aren\u2019t there rigidities"},"2215":{"dur":2,"text":"that have to do with the receiving country,"},"2217":{"dur":3,"text":"that have to do with already existing codes."},"2221":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of the things that we\u2019ve been talking about"},"2224":{"dur":4,"text":"involve a sort of hybridized approach to doing business."},"2229":{"dur":5,"text":"In the case of a not-for-profit foundation supporting for-profit businesses,"},"2234":{"dur":5,"text":"a government trying to move things along in the development of businesses."},"2240":{"dur":3,"text":"You\u2019re involving different sectors that

don\u2019t keep some mandates of our own,"},"2713":{"dur":4,"text":"they will never have the capacity, you\u2019re never going to get an African Oxfam,"},"2717":{"dur":2,"text":"an African McKinsey,

themselves"},"2730":{"dur":6,"text":"out of a job and in the past eight months I have seen my acumen expand,"},"2737":{"dur":4,"text":"as I really have had to sort of say, what will it take for this

happen?"},"2748":{"dur":3,"text":"And sometimes it\u2019s not the international NGO being an intermediary,"},"2752":{"dur":3,"text":"it becomes, okay, build their capacity for them to be able to do it."},"2755":{"dur":6,"text":"But it\u2019s a fascinating push and pull on the international donor assistance community"},"2761":{"dur":3,"text":"and how do you ever have the critical mass of African,"},"2765":{"dur":1,"text":"in  my perspective, African organizations,"},"2767":{"dur":2,"text":"not only as the implementers of the programs"},"2769":{"dur":2,"text":"but also as the capacity

you say, it is push and pull."},"2781":{"dur":4,"text":"Let me give you another example, women owned businesses."},"2786":{"dur":2,"text":"Lots of people now investing in women owned businesses."},"2788":{"dur":5,"text":"This is absolutely fantastic but what is your definition of a woman owned business?"},"2793":{"dur":3,"text":"And maybe we should be talking about women led businesses"},"2797":{"dur":4,"text":"because when I talked about problem women have having access to capital,"},"2802":{"dur":4,"text":"so if you\u2019re insisting that you only help women owned businesses,"},"2806":{"dur":5,"text":"if they\u2019re 100%, or maybe even over 50%, owned by women,"},"2811":{"dur":3,"text":"you come up against a problem that in many countries in the world,"},"2815":{"dur":3,"text":"it\u2019s very difficult for women to get that access to capital."},"2819":{"dur":3,"text":"But they could be women led businesses but,"},"2822":{"dur":4,"text":"because of the way the finance is required, they may be owned,"},"2827":{"dur":2,"text":"not more than 50% by women,"},"2829":{"dur":3,"text":"does that mean that these women businesses don\u2019t deserve help?"},"2832":{"dur":5,"text":"So this is again about, we need to work out whether the definitions"},"2838":{"dur":2,"text":"we\u2019re adopting with the right intentions,"},"2840":{"dur":4,"text":"which is to help the development and to help particularly local development"},"2845":{"dur":3,"text":"or woman's development, whether in fact they\u2019re really helping"},"2849":{"dur":5,"text":"or whether in fact they\u2019re just putting up these negative legal barriers"},"2854":{"dur":2,"text":"that mean it doesn\u2019t actually work."},"2857":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think when we think about women owned businesses"},"2860":{"dur":6,"text":"we maybe be better off changing on definition to be women led businesses."},"2867":{"dur":4,"text":"How important is what\u2019s happening in the country"},"2872":{"dur":5,"text":"that you\u2019re trying to do your work in, as far as legal

sometimes,"},"2896":{"dur":2,"text":"and we were talking about all the other things that"},"2898":{"dur":3,"text":"go into operating a profitable business."},"2901":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, certainly for us it\u2019s fundamental, right?"},"2905":{"dur":3,"text":"Like, at the core of what we\u2019re trying to do is change corporate law"},"2909":{"dur":5,"text":"and if we\u2019re walking into an environment that is not enabling of a company"},"2914":{"dur":3,"text":"to both make money and make a difference, that needs to be changed."},"2917":{"dur":1,"text":"We need to start with corporate law."},"2919":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, at the very beginning when we enter a new market"},"2923":{"dur":5,"text":"is an evaluation of what current law requires of the corporation and frankly,"},"2929":{"dur":2,"text":"surprisingly, in many jurisdictions,"},"2932":{"dur":7,"text":"it is frankly a liability to not maximize the return to shareholder."},"2942":{"dur":6,"text":"Literally a liability for the directors and executives not to return"},"2948":{"dur":2,"text":"as much money as humanly possible to shareholders"},"2951":{"dur":3,"text":"and so if you ask me like, how important is that, that\u2019s\u2014"},"2954":{"dur":4,"text":"Are you out of the game in a place that has that as a requirement?"},"2958":{"dur":2,"text":"Delaware had that requirement until we changed it."},"2962":{"dur":1,"text":"Full stop."},"2964":{"dur":7,"text":"Like the vast majority of jurisdictions begin with a legal framework"},"2972":{"dur":2,"text":"that requires shareholder primacy."},"2975":{"dur":7,"text":"That is the normal approach to how business is structured and

terms of where we begin with"},"3006":{"dur":2,"text":"law in the jurisdictions in which we work."},"3010":{"dur":1,"text":"I could talk a bit about land if you like?"},"3012":{"dur":1,"text":"Quickly."},"3013":{"dur":4,"text":"All  I\u2019m going to say is, you know, when I was a law student studying land law"},"3018":{"dur":3,"text":"I thought ,why are we bothering with all this registered law stuff,"},"3021":{"dur":5,"text":"it all just you know\u2014now I realize, you know, if you don\u2019t have registered land,"},"3027":{"dur":3,"text":"and so you don\u2019t know who owns the land,"},"3030":{"dur":6,"text":"then it\u2019s a real impediment on economic development because so much of,"},"3036":{"dur":2,"text":"again our women\u2019s access to capital,"},"3038":{"dur":3,"text":"so much of your access to capital depends on your collateral."},"3042":{"dur":3,"text":"And so much of the collateral will often be depending on"},"3046":{"dur":2,"text":"whether you own land or not, and then you discover that"},"3048":{"dur":6,"text":"there is no land registration and so it is assumed that the land belongs to the men."},"3055":{"dur":3,"text":"We know, don\u2019t we, wasn\u2019t it something like 80% of all agricultural work"},"3059":{"dur":4,"text":"is done by women, and like 1% of the agricultural land is owned by women."},"3066":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, you have to do more to have registered the land and to ensure that,"},"3070":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, when land is owned by a family,"},"3072":{"dur":3,"text":"that the wives and the daughters have equal rights"},"3076":{"dur":4,"text":"to be able to hold and own and transmit that land,"},"3081":{"dur":3,"text":"and without changing that, you don\u2019t even get started."},"3087":{"dur":6,"text":"Charlotte, is there a ladder for women who you do business with,"},"3093":{"dur":7,"text":"if they show some skill and some talent at running a local retail sales point."},"3101":{"dur":6,"text":"Is there a next logical step, where perhaps they become the rep for an area,"},"3107":{"dur":5,"text":"or a distributor for a district, or is there some half,"},"3113":{"dur":5,"text":"that for talented entrepreneurs to move ahead in Coke world?"},"3120":{"dur":5,"text":"I mean, the most logical one is, if you open a small business as a retailer,"},"3126":{"dur":6,"text":"we\u2019ve seen many retailers then become bigger suppliers in that area and,"},"3132":{"dur":3,"text":"you know, we have wonderful stories of women who are now,"},"3135":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, I think the third largest distributor in Nairobi."},"3140":{"dur":4,"text":"So, huge opportunity to grow but I think a good example would be,"},"3145":{"dur":1,"text":"you know, what we do with artisans."},"3146":{"dur":4,"text":"So, a lot of the artisans that we train have literally,"},"3151":{"dur":4,"text":"some of them have literally just been living on waste dumps"},"3156":{"dur":4,"text":"and how you even make their life safe to begin with, and their waste pickers,"},"3160":{"dur":3,"text":"and help, you know, working with local NGO\u2019s in places like Brazil,"},"3164":{"dur":2,"text":"where you actually help them to form co-operatives,"},"3167":{"dur":3,"text":"you help them to actually collect waste safely"},"3171":{"dur":3,"text":"and actually be able to earn a living from that in a safe way,"},"3175":{"dur":5,"text":"and be able to then supply local artisans."},"3180":{"dur":3,"text":"And

how to make,"},"3191":{"dur":1,"text":"but make them in a much higher quality way,"},"3193":{"dur":4,"text":"so they can increase the market access they have from a very small area,"},"3198":{"dur":2,"text":"to a broader area locally."},"3200":{"dur":3,"text":"What we then have done is, we\u2019ve made those available"},"3204":{"dur":5,"text":"on our internal website to 700,000 employees."},"3210":{"dur":4,"text":"So they start to get orders and they start to learn how to fulfill those orders"},"3215":{"dur":2,"text":"and we say to all of our

done is, some of those\u2014for us, the benefit for us,"},"3256":{"dur":2,"text":"just to be really clear as a business,"},"3258":{"dur":4,"text":"is it helps people locally in the community see a value to recycling."},"3263":{"dur":2,"text":"So, suddenly the communities are cleaner."},"3267":{"dur":2,"text":"People are collecting, you know, empty bottles or empty cans"},"3269":{"dur":3,"text":"in the local community because they see that there\u2019s a value to doing that,"},"3273":{"dur":3,"text":"so not only is it benefiting the community because it\u2019s a nicer community to live in,"},"3276":{"dur":2,"text":"but it also creates value for that local community."},"3279":{"dur":2,"text":"So that\u2019s the knock-on effect."},"3281":{"dur":4,"text":"And

world,"},"3435":{"dur":3,"text":"why do you need the US African Development Foundation?"},"3438":{"dur":3,"text":"And I have spent a lot of time not meeting with the corporations"},"3442":{"dur":4,"text":"that I was hired to meet with or not doing a lot of the collaboration with philanthropists."},"3446":{"dur":4,"text":"We\u2019re talking to members of Congress about local economic development,"},"3450":{"dur":3,"text":"about peace and security and prosperity,"},"3454":{"dur":5,"text":"being the best offence to the defense of posture that we have,"},"3459":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, now in our in our political climate."},"3462":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I, personally, have lived in northern Nigeria, the home of Boko Haram."},"3466":{"dur":3,"text":"I lived in East Africa, you know, Al-Shabaab."},"3470":{"dur":2,"text":"We work in the Great Lakes regions highly,"},"3472":{"dur":2,"text":"highly, highly post conflict and conflict nations."},"3475":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, to be able to talk to members of Congress who literally are talking about,"},"3479":{"dur":1,"text":"are you efficient, are you effective,"},"3480":{"dur":4,"text":"and what\u2019s the return on investment for taxpayer dollars in those places?"},"3485":{"dur":4,"text":"To be able  to say, look, this is a local economic stimulus package,"},"3489":{"dur":4,"text":"if these local communities, women led enterprises, agricultural co-operatives,"},"3494":{"dur":5,"text":"if they are prosperous, if they grow in the revenues, if they create more jobs,"},"3500":{"dur":3,"text":"they are no longer poor and vulnerable looking for alternatives"},"3504":{"dur":3,"text":"and those alternatives lead to sort of some choices that we don\u2019t like."},"3507":{"dur":4,"text":"If we don\u2019t do this, if we are offensive with our support for local economic development,"},"3512":{"dur":4,"text":"for foreign assistance, we\u2019re going to be defensive in a way that we can never defend."},"3516":{"dur":5,"text":"So, you know, the climate is definitely, definitely a different value proposition."},"3521":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019d never in 20 years talked to anybody about what\u2019s the need for,"},"3525":{"dur":5,"text":"you know, economic development from the US foreign assistance in an African nation,"},"3530":{"dur":1,"text":"but this is a conversation we\u2019re having."},"3532":{"dur":3,"text":"But it also is making me go back to the core of what is the return on investment?"},"3536":{"dur":2,"text":"Why is this important for America?"},"3539":{"dur":4,"text":"And so it\u2019s actually cathartic to some extent because these are based\u2014"},"3543":{"dur":4,"text":"It\u2019s not preaching to the choir, which is what we do at SKOLL and WEF"},"3547":{"dur":2,"text":"and the other places, it\u2019s like the non-converted"},"3550":{"dur":3,"text":"and how do you really fundamentally talk to someone"},"3553":{"dur":4,"text":"about the importance of economic growth as a driver to peace, security,"},"3557":{"dur":2,"text":"prosperity and business as part of that solution,"},"3560":{"dur":5,"text":"and so it\u2019s been a whirlwind in terms of where I was 6-8 months ago"},"3565":{"dur":4,"text":"and where I am now but it\u2019s also been interesting on the other end, to your point."},"3570":{"dur":4,"text":"I talk to, obviously, a lot of heads of state and ambassadors in Washington,"},"3574":{"dur":4,"text":"but to be able to have conversations with them around donor assistance"},"3579":{"dur":3,"text":"and around investing in their countries and in their communities,"},"3582":{"dur":3,"text":"in these poor and vulnerable communities, in their nations, and to be able to say,"},"3585":{"dur":3,"text":"look, the reality is that I\u2019m getting asked questions about our efficiency,"},"3589":{"dur":2,"text":"our effectiveness, our return on investment."},"3591":{"dur":3,"text":"So you as a nation, you know, we have to talk more clearly"},"3595":{"dur":3,"text":"about your contribution to what we are doing as well."},"3599":{"dur":2,"text":"So it literally is having a conversation like a business deal,"},"3601":{"dur":5,"text":"Charlotte, on like, okay, where is the skin in a game in a big way?"},"3606":{"dur":2,"text":"In terms of, if we are working in these communities"},"3609":{"dur":2,"text":"and we have a model for economic development,"},"3611":{"dur":3,"text":"how are you as a nation looking at the 250,000 grant"},"3615":{"dur":1,"text":"that we\u2019re making to these co-operatives,"},"3617":{"dur":3,"text":"how are you looking at your own development programs"},"3620":{"dur":2,"text":"and saying we want to replicate that in 30 other places?"},"3623":{"dur":3,"text":"Because you know, we want to be able to come in and demonstrate success,"},"3627":{"dur":2,"text":"and to be honest, to be able to leave and so that"},"3629":{"dur":1,"text":"while we helped them get on their feet,"},"3631":{"dur":1,"text":"these businesses, they\u2019re running without us."},"3633":{"dur":3,"text":"And to now to be able to have to talk to government officials"},"3636":{"dur":4,"text":"in the nations about the US, as making that part of our value proposition now,"},"3641":{"dur":3,"text":"it\u2019s changed the framework, but to be honest, countries like Rwanda,"},"3644":{"dur":5,"text":"I was literally yesterday talking in DC with the ambassador to Rwanda and she said,"},"3650":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, in our nation we don\u2019t want aid anymore."},"3654":{"dur":3,"text":"We are talking about trade in our in nation and so,"},"3657":{"dur":4,"text":"CD, when you do come, when ADF is working with our women's groups"},"3662":{"dur":2,"text":"and doing things around agriculture,"},"3664":{"dur":3,"text":"it needs to be, not foreign assistance, but an investment."},"3667":{"dur":2,"text":"[01:01:08]  And so we also want those groups to increase their incomes,"},"3670":{"dur":2,"text":"to create jobs, to grow their revenues."},"3673":{"dur":6,"text":"It\u2019s amazing that now these nation are still seeing it as sort of transactional"},"3679":{"dur":2,"text":"but for the greater good and we\u2019re catalytic"},"3682":{"dur":2,"text":"but we get out of the way and they take over."},"3685":{"dur":0,"text":"Questions?"},"3687":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes ma'am."},"3689":{"dur":3,"text":"You, stand up, tell us who you are."},"3693":{"dur":5,"text":"Roberta Baskin and I just would like to double click on what you just said"},"3698":{"dur":7,"text":"about Rwanda and also on what Bono said last night about women\u2019s empowerment"},"3706":{"dur":3,"text":"at this time, that that\u2019s what we need."},"3709":{"dur":4,"text":"I read a book about Rwanda by Swanee Hunt that\u2019s coming out next month called,"},"3715":{"dur":2,"text":"\u2018Rwandan Women Rising\u2019 and it\u2019s about women's leadership in Rwanda,"},"3717":{"dur":2,"text":"which is now number one in the world."},"3720":{"dur":4,"text":"64% in parliament and also women on the Bench"},"3725":{"dur":4,"text":"and women in leadership positions throughout government."},"3729":{"dur":6,"text":"And I\u2019m wondering about the impact on business in Rwanda, trade not aid."},"3737":{"dur":3,"text":"What you can say from all of your perspectives about,"},"3741":{"dur":5,"text":"Rwanda is a happening place and very much based on women's leadership."},"3747":{"dur":0,"text":"Thank you."},"3749":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, let me say about Rwanda, you mentioned the ambassador, she?"},"3754":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes, exactly. \n-We also,"},"3755":{"dur":3,"text":"the High Commissioner from Rwanda here is also a woman,"},"3759":{"dur":6,"text":"so yeah, they\u2019re not just in the government, the Foreign Minister is a woman."},"3765":{"dur":3,"text":"I was in Rwanda just three weeks ago."},"3768":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean the question is, at this rate they\u2019re going to have to"},"3770":{"dur":6,"text":"implement their 66% quota on behalf of the men in Parliament."},"3777":{"dur":6,"text":"We\u2019ve done a fantastic program in Rwanda with the help from Accenture."},"3783":{"dur":5,"text":"We reached 16,000 Rwandan women with a mixture of programs."},"3789":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of them we supported with our mentoring platform,"},"3793":{"dur":5,"text":"some of them working with Care International and their savings and loans clubs."},"3799":{"dur":4,"text":"We went into the villages and turned the savings and loans clubs,"},"3804":{"dur":6,"text":"which at that time were saving in boxes and we developed a mobile phone app,"},"3810":{"dur":1,"text":"so that instead of saving in boxes,"},"3811":{"dur":2,"text":"they were able to save on the mobile phone"},"3814":{"dur":3,"text":"and earn a little interest on that product."},"3817":{"dur":2,"text":"We also developed a loan product,"},"3819":{"dur":3,"text":"which was about ten percent less in interest rate,"},"3823":{"dur":5,"text":"than the standard rate of interest for the loans in Rwanda."},"3829":{"dur":2,"text":"Because that\u2019s one of the features in Africa isn\u2019t it,"},"3831":{"dur":7,"text":"that the expense of bank loans is horrendous, you know, 25, 30, 35%,"},"3839":{"dur":5,"text":"you know, no wonder no one wants to take out a bank loan."},"3844":{"dur":3,"text":"Particularly as, and going back to the legal question,"},"3847":{"dur":4,"text":"where in many of these countries, if you default on a bank loan,"},"3851":{"dur":2,"text":"you don\u2019t just get taken to court in a civil way"},"3854":{"dur":2,"text":"but you could actually be sent to prison still for debt."},"3857":{"dur":3,"text":"So that\u2019s another example of where you need to change the laws"},"3861":{"dur":3,"text":"in order to encourage behavior."},"3864":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we are seeing in Rwanda generally,"},"3867":{"dur":3,"text":"is a development from an agricultural based economy ,"},"3871":{"dur":2,"text":"which is still very much an agricultural based economy,"},"3874":{"dur":4,"text":"because you know, Rwanda initially didn\u2019t seem to have any other resources"},"3879":{"dur":4,"text":"but its climate and its produce, though in fact,"},"3883":{"dur":3,"text":"it\u2019s now there are minerals there and things being discovered."},"3888":{"dur":3,"text":"The reasons that I think the minerals are now starting to become of interest"},"3892":{"dur":3,"text":"to companies, is the fact that the government has built the infrastructure,"},"3895":{"dur":6,"text":"it\u2019s built the roads, it\u2019s invested in the IT and in the telecommunications strategy."},"3902":{"dur":5,"text":"And it\u2019s gone right up in the ease of doing business index"},"3907":{"dur":4,"text":"so therefore it\u2019s attracting this investment now, as a result of which,"},"3912":{"dur":2,"text":"companies are much more keen."},"3914":{"dur":3,"text":"Even little things like it\u2019s developed five star hotels because,"},"3918":{"dur":5,"text":"you know, let's be honest, many businesses who are traveling to countries"},"3923":{"dur":3,"text":"for development would prefer to have a comfortable hotel."},"3927":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, it may sound trivial but all these things matter."},"3929":{"dur":4,"text":"So I think Rwanda\u2019s a great example of how political leadership"},"3934":{"dur":7,"text":"has driven that country from the depths of despair over genocide,"},"3942":{"dur":5,"text":"to one of the biggest growing economies,"},"3948":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, relatively from where it starts in Africa"},"3952":{"dur":2,"text":"Lets go the first row here, get a mic over there."},"3960":{"dur":0,"text":"Thank you."},"3961":{"dur":2,"text":"My name\u2019s Joseph Walugembe from Uganda."},"3964":{"dur":1,"text":"I will put in just two quick questions."},"3966":{"dur":4,"text":"On the first one, forgive my naivety about international relations,"},"3970":{"dur":6,"text":"but I love all the values you are trying to propel in business,"},"3976":{"dur":5,"text":"but what\u2019s your reflection on the business environment in Uganda,"},"3982":{"dur":2,"text":"that is in Africa or some African countries"},"3984":{"dur":3,"text":"that is being dominated by quote\/unquote \u201cChina\u201d,"},"3988":{"dur":3,"text":"who clearly are not talking to our governments any more about human rights"},"3992":{"dur":2,"text":"and they seem to be the driving on the block,"},"3994":{"dur":2,"text":"because they don\u2019t talk about all these issues you talk about"},"3997":{"dur":4,"text":"that make the majority of men in our governments uncomfortable."},"4002":{"dur":3,"text":"And secondly, yesterday I was running a workshop"},"4005":{"dur":5,"text":"and I was talking of how to incentivize business to think about people"},"4010":{"dur":3,"text":"who could be initially considered probably less productive,"},"4014":{"dur":6,"text":"less business wise viable, to be supported to participate in all the benefits"},"4020":{"dur":2,"text":"that business bring, like people with disabilities."},"4023":{"dur":2,"text":"I would like to hear about your take on that,"},"4025":{"dur":2,"text":"especially when you talk about extremely poor women,"},"4028":{"dur":4,"text":"who could include poor women with disabilities at the bottom of that category."},"4033":{"dur":0,"text":"Thank you."},"4035":{"dur":1,"text":"Lets take the second one first."},"4039":{"dur":3,"text":"Creation of capacity, training, so on."},"4045":{"dur":3,"text":"I think one of the reasons that it\u2019s important for us to,"},"4049":{"dur":3,"text":"why we don\u2019t do the training on our own, we do it with other people,"},"4052":{"dur":5,"text":"is to really make sure that when you\u2019re dealing with the bottom of the pyramid,"},"4058":{"dur":4,"text":"some of the some of the poorest women,"},"4062":{"dur":4,"text":"who don\u2019t have access to so many of the things that we want to give them access to,"},"4067":{"dur":2,"text":"is that you bring other people to the table."},"4070":{"dur":3,"text":"We talk about it as the golden triangle, you know, you bring government,"},"4073":{"dur":4,"text":"you bring civil society, you bring NGO\u2019s,"},"4077":{"dur":4,"text":"you bring other businesses to try and find the collective"},"4082":{"dur":2,"text":"and unique set of skills and experiences"},"4084":{"dur":2,"text":"that will actually develop the programs that are relevant."},"4087":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we don\u2019t know all of the things, we might be on the ground,"},"4092":{"dur":5,"text":"and we might have great access and understanding of the local culture and community,"},"4097":{"dur":2,"text":"but we may not know everything there is to know,"},"4100":{"dur":4,"text":"so we obviously work with other partners that bring a deeper understanding"},"4104":{"dur":3,"text":"sometimes of the unintended consequences of some of the programs,"},"4108":{"dur":1,"text":"to make sure that all of that is built in."},"4110":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I\u2019m not sure if that answers your question"},"4112":{"dur":2,"text":"but that\u2019s the way I would think about it."},"4115":{"dur":5,"text":"And on China, Africa is sort of the proving ground for\u2014"},"4121":{"dur":3,"text":"There\u2019s a competition of different visions of how to do development."},"4125":{"dur":5,"text":"Right now China's approach toward resource extraction,"},"4131":{"dur":2,"text":"skills transfer, technology transfer,"},"4133":{"dur":3,"text":"control of land is a very different proposition from"},"4136":{"dur":4,"text":"what you\u2019ve been talking about on the panel this morning"},"4141":{"dur":4,"text":"and Africa is going to be given a stark choice."},"4145":{"dur":2,"text":"Well no, they already are asking questions about that,"},"4147":{"dur":5,"text":"I think, in Africa and I think China is already starting to see that possibly going"},"4153":{"dur":6,"text":"into a country, extracting its minerals, and bringing all the labor,"},"4159":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, even the cooks and the cleaners,"},"4162":{"dur":7,"text":"all imported is possibly not the best way to win friends and influence people."},"4170":{"dur":8,"text":"I mean, we see it, don\u2019t we, now and it\u2019s what you\u2019re doing in your work,"},"4178":{"dur":6,"text":"is that companies are much more aware these days of the need"},"4185":{"dur":4,"text":"to be good corporate citizens and to engage with the local community,"},"4190":{"dur":4,"text":"so that they don\u2019t just seem to come in as vultures who swoop down,"},"4194":{"dur":4,"text":"take out the riches of the country and don\u2019t give anything back."},"4199":{"dur":4,"text":"That is not the approach of many, many mining companies these days, for example."},"4204":{"dur":1,"text":"Many of the big mining companies are very,"},"4206":{"dur":6,"text":"very aware of how they need to engage with the local community."},"4213":{"dur":1,"text":"What\u2019s interesting to me as someone"},"4214":{"dur":2,"text":"who now does a lot of these trade arbitration disputes,"},"4217":{"dur":4,"text":"is whether we\u2019re seeing it transmitting from the lawyers"},"4221":{"dur":3,"text":"who are advising the companies from a corporate social responsibility,"},"4225":{"dur":2,"text":"to the lawyers who are advising the companies at the end"},"4228":{"dur":3,"text":"when these contracts go wrong, about suing governments"},"4231":{"dur":4,"text":"who are trying to put in some kind of social responsibilities."},"4237":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think we\u2019ve seen this revulsion, if you like,"},"4241":{"dur":3,"text":"going around which is reflected TTP and TTIP,"},"4244":{"dur":3,"text":"the international trade agreements between the EU and the US,"},"4247":{"dur":5,"text":"for example, and the arbitration community itself is now talking about"},"4253":{"dur":5,"text":"how you redesign international trade arbitrations to take into account"},"4259":{"dur":4,"text":"the legitimate desire of governments to ensure that it protects the environment,"},"4265":{"dur":4,"text":"the social structure of a country."},"4269":{"dur":5,"text":"So, going back to again, lawyers are  starting to think a bit more creatively"},"4275":{"dur":3,"text":"about these things too and I think we\u2019re going to see"},"4279":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot more movement in this space."},"4283":{"dur":4,"text":"And it\u2019s very much linked into the sort of work that you\u2019re doing,"},"4287":{"dur":2,"text":"and the sort of work that Coca-Cola is doing,"},"4289":{"dur":7,"text":"because Coca-Cola absolutely understands that they need to be a good global citizen,"},"4297":{"dur":3,"text":"because if you are a good global citizen, people want to buy your products,"},"4301":{"dur":2,"text":"people want to work for you, and investors,"},"4303":{"dur":4,"text":"smart investors reckon that your share price is going to carry on going up"},"4308":{"dur":3,"text":"and not suddenly be plunged down by some scandal,"},"4311":{"dur":2,"text":"because these days we are only a mobile phone away, aren\u2019t we,"},"4314":{"dur":3,"text":"from a picture that no one wants to see."},"4318":{"dur":3,"text":"I just wanted to pick up on what Cherie\u2019s referring to here."},"4321":{"dur":4,"text":"One of the challenges that we all need to overcome is the belief"},"4325":{"dur":3,"text":"that this engagement and these critical issues is concessionary."},"4330":{"dur":5,"text":"That by engaging in, involving your organization in your local community,"},"4335":{"dur":3,"text":"building capacity, creating high quality jobs,"},"4339":{"dur":6,"text":"having a conscientious approach to the environment, those aren\u2019t cost,"},"4346":{"dur":4,"text":"those are opportunities and the data is becoming overwhelming,"},"4350":{"dur":4,"text":"that over the long haul it builds a more resilient business."},"4354":{"dur":2,"text":"I think Coke could speak to this absolutely directly,"},"4357":{"dur":4,"text":"that if you look over any significant period of time,"},"4361":{"dur":3,"text":"higher standards of environmental, social and governance practices,"},"4365":{"dur":3,"text":"leads to higher returns for shareholders and more resilience."},"4368":{"dur":3,"text":"And I can say for our community, the Certified B Corp community,"},"4372":{"dur":1,"text":"during the financial downturn,"},"4374":{"dur":3,"text":"they were 64% more likely to survive the financial downturn."},"4378":{"dur":1,"text":"I couldn't agree more, Cherie."},"4379":{"dur":2,"text":"This isn\u2019t an expense base,"},"4382":{"dur":3,"text":"it\u2019s an opportunity to build resilience in your corporations."},"4387":{"dur":4,"text":"We\u2019re pretty close to the end of our time, if someone\u2019s got a quick question,"},"4392":{"dur":4,"text":"that can be answered quickly, that might help us get off on time."},"4396":{"dur":1,"text":"Sir you had your hand up."},"4402":{"dur":3,"text":"It really is quick, I\u2019m Edward Millard from Rainforest Alliance and,"},"4406":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, to that last point, yes, but we\u2019re not there yet."},"4408":{"dur":3,"text":"And as we have a journalist moderating this panel"},"4412":{"dur":3,"text":"I just wanted to give a shout for the really, really important role"},"4415":{"dur":8,"text":"that journalism media has to play still in being one of these agents for change,"},"4424":{"dur":3,"text":"because business is more informed, more aware,"},"4428":{"dur":4,"text":"but statistics tell us that they\u2019re not all  actually there where we want them to be"},"4433":{"dur":2,"text":"and you guys often name and shame them"},"4436":{"dur":3,"text":"and that\u2019s a really important part of this moving business behavior."},"4440":{"dur":3,"text":"It wasn\u2019t a question but since you said nice things about journalists,"},"4443":{"dur":2,"text":"we\u2019ll end it there."},"4446":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you very much for
