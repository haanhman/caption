{"4":{"dur":3,"text":"[APPLAUSE]"},"10":{"dur":1,"text":"Hello, everybody."},"12":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm actually really\nexcited to do this."},"13":{"dur":1,"text":"This is kind of cool\nto be in a space"},"15":{"dur":1,"text":"where everyone\nloves 3D printing."},"17":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's cool."},"18":{"dur":3,"text":"So as you heard\nfor my actual job,"},"22":{"dur":1,"text":"I work in film\nindustry and that."},"23":{"dur":2,"text":"But what a lot of the\nstuff you see here"},"26":{"dur":2,"text":"is actually for\npersonal projects."},"28":{"dur":2,"text":"So a lot of us in the film\nindustry will take that stuff"},"31":{"dur":4,"text":"and will take those skills and\nuse them on our own projects."},"35":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's get started."},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"So one of the\ndifficult things that I"},"40":{"dur":2,"text":"heard when I got to\ncome here and talk"},"43":{"dur":1,"text":"was to say what is 3D printing."},"44":{"dur":1,"text":"So half the people here\nprobably been printing"},"46":{"dur":3,"text":"for a long time and the other\nhalf are excited to learn."},"50":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's a pretty daunting\nthing to try to describe"},"53":{"dur":3,"text":"in a very short period of time."},"56":{"dur":3,"text":"But what I thought\nof was, what would"},"59":{"dur":4,"text":"I wish somebody had told me when\nI first started out printing"},"63":{"dur":1,"text":"so I wouldn't get discouraged?"},"64":{"dur":1,"text":"So here's some--\nthis isn't negative."},"66":{"dur":1,"text":"This is words of\nencouragement, in case"},"67":{"dur":2,"text":"you start struggling when\nyou're first learning."},"70":{"dur":1,"text":"So as you can see, some\nof the pictures here."},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a cool dragon\nthat didn't quite finish"},"74":{"dur":0,"text":"and some other stuff."},"75":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's basically what it\nsays, a potential distraction"},"78":{"dur":1,"text":"from what really matters."},"79":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can sometimes become\nobsessed with the process"},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"and not so much what it's about."},"85":{"dur":4,"text":"It's definitely a master class\nin expectation management."},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's somehow both\namazing and horrible."},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"But in all seriousness,\nit actually"},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"is kind of secretly\nambitious because everybody"},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"wants you to think you just hit\nthe button and something comes"},"101":{"dur":0,"text":"out."},"102":{"dur":2,"text":"But the reality is, is\nit's very difficult."},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"And depending on the\nprocess, it could be"},"107":{"dur":3,"text":"very costly and time-consuming."},"110":{"dur":3,"text":"So what 3D printing is\nnot is, like I said,"},"114":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not a household appliance."},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not impossible,\nbut it's not easy."},"119":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not an alternative\nto doing it by hand."},"122":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think a lot of people\nthink that the prints come out"},"125":{"dur":0,"text":"like this."},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"But as you can see, this\nis the reality of it."},"129":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can try to\nprint it like this,"},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"but it limits you a little bit."},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"Another thing it's not is\nlinear in the design process."},"135":{"dur":4,"text":"So this term rip-mod-fab,\nbasically what that means--"},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's a term that they've\nbeen coining, actually,"},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"over at the Pier 9\nfacility-- is the process"},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"of kind of\nround-tripping your work."},"146":{"dur":1,"text":"So instead of just\ndesigning it in the computer"},"148":{"dur":1,"text":"and printing it\nand then that's it,"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"you'd basically 3D print it."},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe you add some clay\nto it, change some things,"},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"add some rubber tubing, 3D\nscan that, and then just"},"158":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of round-trip\nthe whole thing."},"159":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's what that\nterm means if you see it"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"a couple times in the slides."},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"And the last thing that it's\nnot is special or impressive"},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"So basically,\neventually no one will"},"169":{"dur":1,"text":"care that you 3D printed it."},"170":{"dur":3,"text":"They'll just be looking at it."},"173":{"dur":1,"text":"So some of the\ncommon types of 3D"},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"printers that you\nprobably heard of."},"177":{"dur":1,"text":"One is an FDM machine."},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"That's like MarketBot or Cubify."},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"Those are accessible."},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"And it really is just a\nglorified hot glue gun."},"185":{"dur":3,"text":"I know that sounds bad, but\nit's basically how it functions."},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you guys saw\nthe idea Ember outside."},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a DLP SLA."},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's basically\na liquid resin."},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"So instead of using a\nPLA or an ABS plastic,"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"like LEGOs, it uses liquid."},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you have a PolyJet,\nwhich is a photo polymer."},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's actually\nwhat these were made on,"},"204":{"dur":3,"text":"was an Objet machine."},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"So another thing to\nbe aware of, if you're"},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of knew to 3D printing,\nis some of the materials"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can use-- that\nyou have access to."},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"Some with these machines and\nsome with special machines"},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"just made for\nmetal, for example."},"222":{"dur":0,"text":"You could do metal."},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"Porcelain is really cool."},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can actually do-- not\njust like vases and stuff."},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can actually order\ncoffee mugs and that."},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like food-safe."},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a carbon fiber\nprinter out there."},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's actually a lot\nlike the FDM machines."},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"And finally, there's wood."},"238":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can actually print with\na wood filament on the MakerBot"},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"So those low-cost\nprinters, you can actually"},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"get different filaments that\nare made with like bronze powder"},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"inside of them and that."},"249":{"dur":4,"text":"And when you buff them out,\nthey look just like real bronze."},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"So a question I\noften get, and I used"},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"to ask this, which 3D\nprinter is best for art?"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"And as corny as it sounds,\nit literally is the one"},"261":{"dur":0,"text":"you have access to."},"262":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you can only afford\na MakerBot or maybe just"},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"a $300 knock-off at Maker Faire,\nget that and learn with it"},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"and become comfortable with\nthe process in general."},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"Because even if you\nsaved all your pennies"},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"and you got the most\nexpensive machine, sometimes"},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"you have a tendency\nto kind of glorify"},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"that machine and you\nwill be afraid to use it."},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"Or you'll think,\noh, I didn't make"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"something that was worthy\nof printing on that machine."},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"But if it's something that\nyou know you don't really"},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"have that much invested into\nand the material is cheap,"},"290":{"dur":5,"text":"you'll fail fast and kind of\nbecome comfortable doing it."},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"So quick examples of how 3D\nprinting is being used today."},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"And outside of this room is\nactually a perfect facility"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"for this that you could\nsee all of these things,"},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"like the Nike exhibit and that."},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"But medical, consumer\nprototypes as you saw the shoes"},"308":{"dur":4,"text":"out there, architectural,\nvisualization, toys-- McFarland"},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"uses a lot of different\n3D-printed action figures"},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"and that for their faces-- and\nproof of concept and fine art."},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"And I kind of probably\nbalance with my buddies"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"in that last two categories."},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"So because working in the\nfilm industry, and then also"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of wanting to have\na sculptural take on it,"},"329":{"dur":4,"text":"I kind of try to balance\nbetween those last two."},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"So along those lines,\nhow I use 3D printing."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"Basically, the way that\nI got into this-- I"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"remember the first\ntime that I learned 3D."},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"The first question\nthat I had was,"},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"can we get this stuff\nout of the computer?"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"And at the time, I don't\nremember how-- maybe it"},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"was like 15 years ago."},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"Someone chuckled\nand was like, yeah."},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, Lockheed and those\nbig companies, they have them,"},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's super-expensive."},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"And basically, no."},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"You can't afford to\nuse a 3D printer."},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"But in my head I thought,\nthere is a chance."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"So someday, maybe it will\nbecome affordable to where"},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"we can make stuff."},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"So put my head down, kept\ngoing, and here we are."},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"We can all have 3D\nprinters, so that's cool."},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"So my overall workflow."},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's kind of\na mobile workflow,"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's not necessarily--\nthat wasn't my intent."},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"It's mostly because--\nas silly as it sounds,"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"I sit at a desk all day."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"So when I go home, I don't\nwant to sit at a desk more."},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'll tend to like want\nto just sit on the couch"},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"and sketch on my\nphone or on a tablet."},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"So one of the quick things\nis I start out always"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"by writing down ideas."},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"And I might get ideas if\nyou're stuck in the DMV,"},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"or in the line at the cafeteria."},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"Or you could just sit there\nand jot down ideas and work"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of stuff out\nbefore you even"},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"start making any kind\nof drawings or anything."},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I'll\nusually use-- I like"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"to use sketchbook, which is\nactually an Autodesk thing."},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"And they have that\nfor Android and Mac,"},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"but it's really good because\nit uses pressure sensitivity"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"if your phone has that."},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's a quick way of,\nagain, getting ideas down."},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"Once I got that\nstuff blocked in,"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll typically\njump over to Maya."},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I kind of bounce\nbetween Mudbox and ZBrush,"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"just to kind of\nblock out the form"},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"that I'm actually\ngoing to be printing."},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"And this fourth one,\nit seems kind of silly"},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's actually the\nmost exciting time."},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"Once you get one of\nthese designs done"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"and you have it on\nyour computer screen,"},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"the first thing\nI'll start doing,"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"before I start to set it up for\nhow big I'm going to print up,"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"is I'll scale it\nup on the screen."},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm looking at the\nmonitor in front of me"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"and getting an\nidea like, oh, man."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"It's going to be about\nthat big on the desk."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"It's going to be amazing."},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"So then I literally just\ntake a ruler and measure"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"that on the screen\nand say, OK, cool."},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"It's going to be 12 inches."},"459":{"dur":0,"text":"Sweet."},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I set that up."},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what's cool about\nthe fine art stuff."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're doing something more\nlike manufacturing or that,"},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"you've got to be a\nlittle bit more specific."},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's certain specs\nand how much the plastic"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"might swell when it prints."},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"But when you're doing\nthis kind of fun stuff,"},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"you have those liberties."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"Once I got the scale done,\nI'll jump back to ZBrush."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"I usually make it\na watertight mesh,"},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"decimate it, and just reduce\nit so it's faster to prep."},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"And then finally,\nwhether you're using"},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"Ember, any kind of\nMakerBot or anything,"},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"they usually have a set of\ntools to create structures"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"that will hold this stuff up."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"Because this thing can't\njust-- some of this stuff"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"can't just float in\nmidair when it's printed."},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"So it will create\nlittle structures."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"And I actually brought\nsome stuff here."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a print."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"You can pass this stuff around."},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"That's some of the support\nstructures I was talking about."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"The software automatically\ngenerated those."},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"And that one was actually\ndone in Form software,"},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"but MeshMixer has a really\nneat one that grows like roots."},"521":{"dur":5,"text":"And finally, again with\nthat rib-mod-fab terminology"},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"I was telling you,\nonce I usually"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"will print something out,\nI'll find that, you know what?"},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"This thing might need\nto be snapped and moved"},"533":{"dur":0,"text":"down a little bit."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"Or I accidentally snapped it."},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'll glue some\ntubes on there."},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe add some clay."},"538":{"dur":0,"text":"Scan that."},"539":{"dur":0,"text":"3D print it again."},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"And you just kind of do\nthis round-trip thing."},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"So one example of\nthis workflow is--"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know if you\nguys saw it out there."},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"It was the little\nstormtrooper helmet."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"So these things are the\npersonal projects stuff."},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"But what was really\ncool was LucasFilm"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"did this really nice\ncharity auction where"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"they would basically\npass out these--"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"they called them as blanks."},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"And you've probably\nseen them before,"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"like they do them with\nMickey Mouse and that."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"And then all the artists\nthat worked for the company"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"would decorate them, and\nthen they auction them"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"So I instantly knew\nbeing the 3D print guy"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"that I wanted to incorporate\n3D printing somehow into it."},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"So right out of the gate,\nI scanned in the helmet."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, you can see I did\nthe little silhouette there"},"583":{"dur":0,"text":"on the phone."},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"And then once I had\nthat silhouette,"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"I was like, it'd be kind of\ncool to make it a vehicle."},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"So I took that\nscan of the helmet,"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"chopped it up, and\nstarted placing it"},"591":{"dur":4,"text":"in ways where you could\nrecognize those surfaces,"},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"like as if it would\nkind of fold up"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"and the action figure\nwould be in there."},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"And because I wanted\nit to be something"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"that looked like a toy, I went\nand got an action figure down"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"in the store at work and scanned\nthat little sand trooper in,"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"and started making\nsure that it was all"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"going to fit in there nicely."},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"So here you can see on the left\nside we've got the Maya model."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"And I didn't want to cheat\nby like scaling anything."},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"I wanted it to be as if\nthat thing could really"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"fold back up."},"619":{"dur":4,"text":"And then just like you could\nsee here, for efficiency"},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"and also just the ease of-- and\nalso being able to print big."},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"You chop these\nthings up sometimes"},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"and lay them out in a way\nwhere you can reassemble them."},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's kind of what\nyou're seeing here."},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"I could have tried\nto print it that way,"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"but it would have filled it all\nup full of support material."},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"And you might not have been able\nto go as big from the volume"},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"that the bill volume allows."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"So usually breaking it\ndown is a good thing."},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"So before we kicked it off\nin the Objet printer-- again,"},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"the nice thing about\nthe glue gun technology"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"is it's really inexpensive."},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"So before going and kicking\nit off on a really expensive"},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"printer, you can kick it off\non one of these lower-end FDM"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"And test to make sure,\nlike in this case,"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"that the stormtrooper would fit\ninto the little walker and all"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"And then once we\nwere happy with it,"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"we went ahead and kicked it\noff in the Objet machine."},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"So on the left, you can see\nwhen it comes out on the Objet"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"machine, the photo\npolymer, that is actually"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"like this wax-like material\nthat's on it on the left."},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's that support\nstructure I was talking about."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"And on the right is after\nit's been all removed"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's kind of been\nrinsed off in a sink."},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's what that is there."},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"On the left here,\nyou see-- usually we"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"use a proxy to kind of\nglue this stuff together"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"and it holds pretty\nwell, but you're always"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"scared that it's\ngoing to collapse"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"when everybody's looking at\nlike here in the gallery."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"So you wire that stuff\nup in case something"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"like that does happen, you can\nkind of get through the night."},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"On the right here, you\ncan see-- the reason"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"it's different materials, too."},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"My wife asked that\nquestion, was just that was"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"And we knew we were\ngoing to paint it."},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"So instead of taking\nthat out and swapping"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"the cartridges of\nmaterial, we just"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"went ahead and rolled with it\nand then sprayed it all black."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"And then finally, for the rust."},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"In this particular\ncase, the paint actually"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"has like iron filings in it."},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you use this\nvinegar-based paint"},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"that actually will activate\nthe-- it's real rust."},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not just like a paint\njob that looks like rust."},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"And then there it\nis at the gallery."},"739":{"dur":0,"text":"So that was pretty cool."},"740":{"dur":0,"text":"That was a fun, little thing."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"And they're actually auctioning\nthose off, I think, here soon."},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"There was a lot of really good\ndesigns that came out of that."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"So the next example is-- I don't\nknow if you saw that guy out"},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"He's the tall guy."},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"He's got this staff."},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"So I call him the Neforak."},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"He's just this alien creature\nthat I wanted to make."},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"And on this one, it was a\nlittle bit different of a build."},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"What I wanted to\ndo was basically"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"kick it off on an FDM\nmachine and maybe do"},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"a small study on an Ember\nor a Form-1 kind of size."},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"And then also, kick it\noff on a big print--"},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"on one of these guys."},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"So this was a little\nbit more ambitious,"},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"but it kind of allowed me to\ndo all three at the same time."},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"And I actually have some\nstuff to pass around while I'm"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"pulling through these ones."},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"So this one here, the gray one."},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"All three of those are\nactually a resin-based print."},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"But they're all from\ndifferent machines."},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"The red one is from a\nnewer machine coming out."},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the clear one\nis from the Ember right"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"out here, the new Autodesk one."},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"And then that gray one\nis from the Form-1."},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see, they all\nhave their strengths."},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"And I don't like to say\nstrengths or weaknesses,"},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"but they're all a\nlittle bit different."},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"The Ember is very high detail."},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"It's got a smaller build\nvolume, but you start"},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"to use that stuff as a tool."},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"You can make maybe a little\naction figure face for that,"},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"and then use a different\nprinter for the vehicle part."},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"But in this case, I kicked\noff the Neforak just in FDM."},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just an ABS plastic."},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"It's very similar to what\nyou would use for LEGOs."},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, here's the one\nthat's passing around now."},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"And what's really\ncool, on the right"},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"I used these little inexpensive\nsolar-powered turntables"},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"And that finishes\nthe cure process."},"842":{"dur":0,"text":"So it's kind of cool."},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"Because I used to\nkind of move it around"},"845":{"dur":1,"text":"and chase the sun at work."},"846":{"dur":3,"text":"We had this like hallway where\nall the old movie stuff is at."},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"And now I just-- I got\nslick and I went on Amazon"},"853":{"dur":0,"text":"and got something."},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, here's\nthe Objet printer."},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"It's the same one we\nused here for dropship."},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"And you see on the left,\nit looks a little soft"},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's covered in that\nwax support material."},"865":{"dur":3,"text":"In the middle, we--\nand I like to say \"we.\""},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"By \"we,\" I mean Evan removed\nall the support material"},"871":{"dur":1,"text":"in the middle there,\nwhich is tedious."},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"And on the right, it's been\nremoved and it's rinsed again."},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can kind of\nsee this process."},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"And here's an example\nof that rip-mod-fab"},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"that I was talking about."},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"So it all keyed together\nwhen it was printed out."},"886":{"dur":1,"text":"But when I saw it\nI thought, it'd"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"be kind of cool if his arm's\ndown a little bit more."},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"And as you become\nmore comfortable,"},"892":{"dur":1,"text":"you'll get in there\nwith tools and kind of"},"894":{"dur":1,"text":"make it to where it can fit."},"895":{"dur":3,"text":"So I changed his pose,\nbasically, a little bit."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the middle, gluing\nthat arm back in after I"},"901":{"dur":1,"text":"dremeled out that piece."},"902":{"dur":1,"text":"And then on the right,\njust painting it,"},"904":{"dur":3,"text":"masking off the base."},"907":{"dur":6,"text":"So this comes back into that\nrip-mod-fab process as well."},"914":{"dur":1,"text":"Basically, I wanted\nto add a staff to him,"},"916":{"dur":1,"text":"have some kind of thing."},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"So if I hadn't\nchanged the print,"},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"I could have just went\nback to the digital file,"},"922":{"dur":1,"text":"made the cool staff,\nand printed it out."},"923":{"dur":2,"text":"But now I know that I've\nchanged the way he is posed"},"926":{"dur":1,"text":"and it wouldn't line up."},"927":{"dur":2,"text":"So what I did was I just took\na piece of armature wire,"},"929":{"dur":1,"text":"put some clay on it,\nreally quick and dirty,"},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"and just posed it so\nthat it was like, yeah."},"933":{"dur":0,"text":"That's quick."},"934":{"dur":0,"text":"I can do that fast."},"935":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't have to get in\nthe computer or anything."},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"Once I got that to where I\nknew it would fit in his hand,"},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"3D scanned that in, tricked\nit out in the computer,"},"941":{"dur":4,"text":"printed it out, and that\nwas the final version."},"946":{"dur":2,"text":"And then as you become more\ncomfortable doing this stuff,"},"948":{"dur":3,"text":"too, and doing things\nto them, you'll"},"951":{"dur":1,"text":"start adding stuff like hoses."},"953":{"dur":1,"text":"Like my first print,\nI feel so bad."},"955":{"dur":1,"text":"Evan printed out\nthat sleepwalker guy"},"957":{"dur":1,"text":"And all those\ncables were printed."},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, I couldn't believe that\nhe didn't snap any of them."},"961":{"dur":3,"text":"He probably did and I just\ndon't even recognize it."},"964":{"dur":1,"text":"A cool technique\nthat you can do--"},"966":{"dur":3,"text":"and this is actually from some\nof the awesome original model"},"969":{"dur":3,"text":"makers at ILM,\nGoodson and Howie."},"973":{"dur":1,"text":"They helped me out so much."},"974":{"dur":1,"text":"But basically, you\ncan take tubing"},"976":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you can put a piece\nof wire inside that tubing"},"978":{"dur":3,"text":"and it allows you to sculpt\nthe tube into a specific way."},"981":{"dur":2,"text":"And you might think, well, I\ndon't really care about that."},"983":{"dur":1,"text":"But if you're doing\na ship like this"},"985":{"dur":1,"text":"that's supposed\nto be really big."},"986":{"dur":1,"text":"If you just take a\npiece of rubber tubing"},"988":{"dur":1,"text":"and let it do it's\nthing, it's going"},"989":{"dur":1,"text":"to be kind of sticking out."},"990":{"dur":1,"text":"It will look like a toy."},"991":{"dur":1,"text":"So what that wire\nallows you to do"},"993":{"dur":4,"text":"is sculpt in like a fake gravity\nthat would be at that size."},"998":{"dur":1,"text":"And in that case,\nI had it all kind"},"999":{"dur":2,"text":"of winding behind his head."},"1002":{"dur":2,"text":"So for the sleepwalker\nand the dropship--"},"1005":{"dur":3,"text":"this is the dropship here."},"1008":{"dur":1,"text":"This one I started out\na little bit different."},"1010":{"dur":5,"text":"I started out banging out a\nlot of basic shapes in Maya."},"1015":{"dur":1,"text":"Got the bulk of it\nworking really well,"},"1017":{"dur":1,"text":"and then I basically\ndid a tune line render,"},"1018":{"dur":1,"text":"and then painted on top of that."},"1019":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is kind of a combination\nbetween like a concept"},"1022":{"dur":4,"text":"sketch and a tune render."},"1026":{"dur":2,"text":"And then once I kind\nof was happy with that,"},"1028":{"dur":2,"text":"I started both of them in tandem\nso that the design language"},"1031":{"dur":1,"text":"would all fit together,\nso it felt like it"},"1033":{"dur":1,"text":"was from the same culture."},"1034":{"dur":1,"text":"And at one point, I\nveered off and did--"},"1036":{"dur":2,"text":"once I was happy with the\ndirection it was going,"},"1038":{"dur":2,"text":"I did the character\nfirst-- the pilot--"},"1041":{"dur":1,"text":"and then worked the\nship around him."},"1042":{"dur":2,"text":"Because then that way,\nlike the ergonomics and all"},"1044":{"dur":2,"text":"that fit him inside\nthe cockpit and stuff."},"1046":{"dur":2,"text":"But initially, I wanted to\nstart them in tandem so they'd"},"1049":{"dur":3,"text":"both work well together."},"1052":{"dur":2,"text":"And here is-- and I\nactually brought these guys"},"1055":{"dur":1,"text":"so you can check them out."},"1059":{"dur":3,"text":"So here is the sleepwalker head."},"1062":{"dur":1,"text":"And this was a resin print."},"1064":{"dur":1,"text":"This is in the software."},"1065":{"dur":2,"text":"This specific one was Form\nthat generates the supports"},"1068":{"dur":2,"text":"that you guys saw earlier."},"1070":{"dur":1,"text":"And here it is when it came out."},"1071":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is that print."},"1072":{"dur":2,"text":"And I don't know if some of\nyou probably already passed it"},"1075":{"dur":1,"text":"But if you look\non the bottom, you"},"1077":{"dur":2,"text":"can feel these little burrs\nthat I've cut off the supports,"},"1080":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can feel on\nthe bottom of that guy."},"1082":{"dur":0,"text":"And that's the thing."},"1083":{"dur":1,"text":"This 3D printing stuff, there's\ndefinitely an art to it."},"1085":{"dur":1,"text":"You could just say\nauto orient my print."},"1087":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, then it faces\nthe character down"},"1088":{"dur":1,"text":"and it sticks like a million\ntoothpicks on his face."},"1090":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you go cut\nthose off and it"},"1092":{"dur":1,"text":"looks like he had chicken pox."},"1093":{"dur":1,"text":"So you learn really\nfast, oh, I'm"},"1095":{"dur":1,"text":"going to lean him\nback and put all"},"1096":{"dur":1,"text":"those burrs underneath\nwhere no one would see it"},"1098":{"dur":0,"text":"after I clip those off."},"1099":{"dur":1,"text":"And then there's little\ntricks to that stuff"},"1100":{"dur":2,"text":"that you learn over time."},"1103":{"dur":3,"text":"And that ship, this\nlittle guy here,"},"1107":{"dur":2,"text":"I knew from putting a big\nship together recently"},"1109":{"dur":2,"text":"with my buddy,\nPete, that you start"},"1112":{"dur":1,"text":"hooking all these fins on."},"1113":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can actually\ngo crazy trying"},"1115":{"dur":2,"text":"to orient these things exactly\nhow you did on the computer."},"1117":{"dur":2,"text":"So this time, I ran\na small resin ship."},"1120":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's this guy right here."},"1123":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was like a little\nstudy that I would use"},"1125":{"dur":1,"text":"while I was posing the fins."},"1126":{"dur":0,"text":"And that was huge."},"1127":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm always going to\ndo that from now on."},"1129":{"dur":1,"text":"That saved a lot of time."},"1133":{"dur":2,"text":"And then moving on\nto the sleepwalker,"},"1136":{"dur":1,"text":"jumped back over to him."},"1138":{"dur":2,"text":"Started running out prints\nof him on the MakerBot."},"1140":{"dur":1,"text":"Because again, it's cheap."},"1141":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, that little\nhead of that sleepwalker"},"1144":{"dur":1,"text":"that I passed around,\nthat's probably,"},"1146":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd say, $40 in material\nwe'll say, roughly."},"1148":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe a little less."},"1150":{"dur":1,"text":"And this was probably like $5."},"1152":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's bigger."},"1153":{"dur":1,"text":"So it doesn't have\nthe same quality,"},"1154":{"dur":2,"text":"but you can prototype it really\nfast and say, you know what?"},"1157":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't even like his\nears being that long."},"1158":{"dur":0,"text":"Run out another one."},"1159":{"dur":1,"text":"And once you start\ngetting happy with it,"},"1161":{"dur":2,"text":"then you start going at the\nmore expensive material."},"1163":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see on the\nbottom there on the left,"},"1166":{"dur":3,"text":"I add clay to them, too, and\nsketch a little bit of stuff,"},"1170":{"dur":2,"text":"just to kind of get a feel\nfor how the details might"},"1172":{"dur":2,"text":"be in the computer."},"1174":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I broke\nit all down just"},"1175":{"dur":1,"text":"like I did with the dropship."},"1177":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can see all of his\nlegs down there on the left."},"1180":{"dur":2,"text":"And then in the middle\nis all of these fins."},"1183":{"dur":3,"text":"On the right is the\nsleepwalker himself printed,"},"1186":{"dur":1,"text":"support material\nremoved, ready to go."},"1196":{"dur":2,"text":"So once it came out of the\nprinter, the sleepwalker"},"1199":{"dur":1,"text":"you can see on the left."},"1200":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, he's covered in\nthat wax-like material."},"1203":{"dur":4,"text":"In the middle, I am\ngluing him all together."},"1207":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can see a close-up."},"1208":{"dur":2,"text":"It's kind of hard to see the\ndetails when these guys first"},"1210":{"dur":0,"text":"come out."},"1211":{"dur":1,"text":"They're very translucent."},"1212":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's hard to\nhandle, but you also"},"1216":{"dur":1,"text":"know that once you\nspray it-- like"},"1217":{"dur":1,"text":"there's some things on here\nthat you can't really see."},"1219":{"dur":2,"text":"But once you spray it black\nand you hit the high points,"},"1221":{"dur":2,"text":"you start to see all\nthose little details."},"1224":{"dur":3,"text":"But it helps early on\nto just kind of keep"},"1227":{"dur":2,"text":"it-- don't put any\npaint on it or anything"},"1229":{"dur":2,"text":"because that can interfere\nwith the epoxies and that."},"1232":{"dur":2,"text":"So at first, it's kind of tricky\nonce you get it all going."},"1234":{"dur":2,"text":"But then once you've got it\nall glued on and ready to go,"},"1237":{"dur":1,"text":"it's really fun when\nyou get to that point"},"1238":{"dur":1,"text":"where you get to spray it and\nsee all those details pop."},"1240":{"dur":2,"text":"Stuff that you didn't even\nknow had made it through."},"1245":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a turntable of it."},"1252":{"dur":2,"text":"And then finally--\nand I'll be honest,"},"1254":{"dur":1,"text":"one of the things about\nthat little walker guy,"},"1256":{"dur":2,"text":"was I actually had\nhis helmet closed up"},"1259":{"dur":1,"text":"when I first designed him."},"1261":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I split it open and did\nthat open version of his suit,"},"1264":{"dur":2,"text":"was the first time my\nfriends and everybody saw it."},"1266":{"dur":1,"text":"So I don't think a lot\nof people understood"},"1268":{"dur":1,"text":"I think they thought it was\nlike some kind of neck thing"},"1270":{"dur":0,"text":"or something."},"1271":{"dur":2,"text":"So then when I closed up\nthe suit and ran it out,"},"1273":{"dur":2,"text":"it was really neat for me to\nhave my friends see it the way"},"1276":{"dur":1,"text":"that I wanted them to see it."},"1277":{"dur":2,"text":"Because at first I was\nlike, this is cool, right?"},"1279":{"dur":1,"text":"And everybody's like, I\ndon't know about that one."},"1280":{"dur":1,"text":"I like the ships, but I\ndon't like that thing."},"1282":{"dur":2,"text":"But once I closed him\nup, everybody got it."},"1285":{"dur":0,"text":"Oh, I see."},"1286":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's what so\ncool about printing,"},"1288":{"dur":2,"text":"is you can actually set\nkey frames on that stuff,"},"1290":{"dur":2,"text":"have the suit kind of\ntransition, and you can pick,"},"1292":{"dur":1,"text":"like maybe three poses\nand run those out."},"1294":{"dur":2,"text":"So they don't have to\nplay a video or anything."},"1297":{"dur":2,"text":"You can just look at it and see\nhow that is going to behave."},"1306":{"dur":1,"text":"And then finally, the dropship."},"1307":{"dur":1,"text":"This is the biggest one."},"1308":{"dur":3,"text":"And the reason that I wanted to\nshow it in this state and not"},"1312":{"dur":4,"text":"just in the pictures is so you\ncan see how-- it's actually"},"1316":{"dur":2,"text":"really fun, but it looks kind\nof intimidating when you first"},"1318":{"dur":1,"text":"get into printing, maybe."},"1319":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, it was for me seeing\nall this wire and stuff."},"1322":{"dur":1,"text":"But once you become more\ncomfortable with it,"},"1324":{"dur":2,"text":"you can do things that you\nwould never be able to print."},"1326":{"dur":2,"text":"You can add wires to them, and\nlittle antennas, and

you could buy that\nat the hardware store"},"1337":{"dur":2,"text":"and then glue it on the back\nof where the exhaust would be."},"1339":{"dur":2,"text":"And once you s that thing black,\nno one's going to know what was"},"1341":{"dur":0,"text":"printed and what wasn't."},"1345":{"dur":4,"text":"So the scariest thing with\nthese prints that you'll"},"1349":{"dur":1,"text":"become

make."},"1363":{"dur":1,"text":"And you literally just\nhave to close your eyes"},"1365":{"dur":2,"text":"and just go for it."},"1367":{"dur":1,"text":"But once you become\ncomfortable with
