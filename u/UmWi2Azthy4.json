idiot."},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"I felt maybe above average relative to the\npeople that I went to high school with."},"580":{"dur":7,"text":"And one of the things that seemed to drive\nsuccess more than sort of hard IQ numbers"},"588":{"dur":6,"text":"was the delayed gratification and the impulse\ncontrol and also just a sense of like willfulness."},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, a lot of people don't think in these\ncommunities that if they work hard they're"},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"actually going to get ahead."},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"And that was a really important component,\nI think, of why so many kids didn't do that"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"well coming from the high school I came from."},"605":{"dur":8,"text":"So I'm probably not providing a very satisfactory\nanswer, but

that your experience,\nI think, would be ones that some of your fellow"},"637":{"dur":5,"text":"students at Yale could use, which is to say,\nyeah, you had a sense that you were maybe"},"642":{"dur":4,"text":"above average, but you weren't paying too\nmuch attention to that kind of thing, and"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"you also did not convey that you had a sense\nthat you were surrounded by a bunch of people"},"651":{"dur":4,"text":"that you couldn't talk to because they weren't\nsmart enough, no sense of that at all."},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"Vance: Right."},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"Absolutely."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"Charles: And I think one of the problems we\nhave these days is that a lot of your fellow"},"659":{"dur":5,"text":"students at Yale have never known anybody\nexcept the same kinds of people they were."},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"Vance: Sure."},"665":{"dur":4,"text":"Charles: And they think of a person who has\nan average IQ or an IQ of 95, and they think,"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Oh, they must be impossible to deal with.\""},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can teach a lot in that regard."},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"Vance: Yeah."},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"I think I have sort of two responses to that\nfeeling that a lot of folks do have, and I"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"agree with you."},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"One is that common sense is really undervalued\nin society and a lot of folks with an IQ of"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"95 or 85 have a lot of common sense, even\nif they don't have fancy degrees, and that's"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"really important."},"691":{"dur":4,"text":"The other thing I'd say is that people maybe\noverstate how smart they are when they get"},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"to Yale."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"I think that there's this impulse to be a\nlittle self-congratulatory about where you"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"came from and one of the ways to do that is\nto just say,
