start"},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"you're actually using something\u2026"},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean generally artists will use\na towel or a piece of clothe\u2026"},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"KATE : Yes.\nGRAEME : But this is a really cool invention."},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"I've never seen this before."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"You've actually set yourself up\nwith a little board\u2026"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"KATE : I have.\nGRAEME : With padding on the back,"},"314":{"dur":4,"text":"like felt padding, which just rests\non this little section

that stops Kate\nfrom smudging her work."},"327":{"dur":6,"text":"And I think, when you look at Kate's work,\nit's got this wonderful soft subtleness in it."},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"You'll find a lot of artists,\nthey'll be fairly heavy"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"but yours is really smooth and subtle all the way."},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"Show us the techniques.\nI know you've got some STAEDTLER

Okay."},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"KATE : It's hot pressed and 300 GSM.\nGRAEME : Okay."},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"KATE : So it's a nice solid\u2026"},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"a smooth finish with a slight tooth, which I like."},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"I actually draw the outline with a HB."},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"GRAEME : Yeah?\nKATE : Which is very light."},"364":{"dur":6,"text":"And I pretty much do the whole drawing\nwith just 2B and a 3B pencil."},"370":{"dur":4,"text":"I really like the STAEDTLER\nwith this combination of paper."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"GRAEME : Yeah.\nKATE : They're a very consistent pencil."},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"GRAEME : Okay.\nKATE : And quite a hard lead"},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"and very rarely get the little\ngritty bits"},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"that some other pencils\u2026"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"GRAEME : Sure.\nKATE : \u2026come with"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"which can damage the surface of the paper.\nGRAEME : You get a dead zone in the pencil."},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"Absolutely."},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"KATE : So I will start with her eyes."},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"GRAEME : If you\u2019re looking at really\ncapturing the detail of an animal,"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"if you\u2019re an expressionist or an abstract artist,"},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of that comes from the heart."},"403":{"dur":5,"text":"But when you're a realist artist, what Kate's\ndone is obviously set up her Mac over there,"},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"and then these are her own photos,"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"when you were back last year\nin Africa weren\u2019t you?"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"KATE : I was, yes."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"GRAEME : And obviously she can refer to those,"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's really important to\nobviously have good material,"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"particularly if it's your own of course,\nto be able to work from."},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"So, and this..."},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"this is...\nSome artists would trace,"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"some artists would grid,"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"you\u2019re good enough to just draw."},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"KATE : I've drawn all my life."},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"GRAEME : Isn't that great?\nKATE : So it has been great."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"GRAEME : Yeah there are not\na lot of artists that can do that."},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"You've got to be very specialized\nand I think extremely talented"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"to know just exactly\nwhere everything\u2019s got to go."},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"Generally a lot of us stumble\naround the pencil going \u2018that's not right\u2019."},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, now the rubber that you've got there?"},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"KATE : Yes I use a knead-able rubber."},"454":{"dur":4,"text":"And the secondary one is a vinyl rubber,"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"which is Karandash."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"Certain brands of knead-able erasers\nare better than others."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"GRAEME : A lot of artists will...\nobviously you being right handed,"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"will do the sketch and\nstart going from left to right?"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"KATE : Yes.\nGRAEME : But you're building"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"the essence of the picture up,\nvery soft layers at a time\u2026"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"KATE : Yes, that's right.\nGRAEME : \u2026to get it where you need to go."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"KATE : And with this I can move across it."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"GRAEME : You don't find that the edge of that\ninterferes?"},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean the beauty about drawing is\nusing the natural arch of your hand\u2026"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"KATE : Yes.\nGRAEME : \u2026to be able to create circles and form."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't find that gets in the way of doing that?"},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"KATE : I found it a little bit awkward when\nI started but it's something you get used to."},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"So yeah you can actually just sort of rest"},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"and get a bit of a\u2026"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"because some of the work is quite\u2026"},"501":{"dur":4,"text":"you need quite a bit of movement in it. So yeah,\nfine, but it does take a few days to get use to."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"GRAEME : Sure, sure.\nKATE : It's great. Keep the work,"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"all the oils and dirt off your hands."},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"And I always start with clean hands,\nkeeps it off the paper."},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"GRAEME : I think part of the mystique"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"and the intrigue of great animal pictures is\nwhat you're doing right now,"},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"which is the eyes.\nKATE : Yes."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"GRAEME : And if you capture\nthe essence of the eyes of an animal\u2026"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"KATE : Yes.\nGRAEME : \u2026you tend to capture their soul as well."},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"KATE : That's right."},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"GRAEME : Your favorite essence about animals"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"is the larger animals.\nKATE : Yes."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"GRAEME : Obviously the predators,\nand you've got the bison"},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"and I've seen that you've done for\u2026"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"and you've been, we've both been\nin the same place as well Jackson Hole."},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"KATE : That's right.\nGRAEME : The galleries in Jackson Hole\u2026"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"KATE : Yes.\nGRAEME : \u2026in Wyoming."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"I was in the Trail Side Gallery many years ago."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"And you are actually in the Wildlife Museum?"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"KATE : I have, yes, I have been\nin the Wildlife Museum show"},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"Western Visions for two years."},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"GRAEME : That's wonderful.

when you're drawing this,"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"I can only speak for myself of course,"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"but that comes back into your mind."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"KATE : Oh it does.\nGRAEME : You can hear everything can't you?"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like you\u2019re there again.\nKATE : That's right."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that's the\nessential part of my artwork"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"and why I use my own reference photos,"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"because I've experienced the whole thing"},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"that transfers then into the piece

soon."},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"GRAEME : Well I can see that,\nas Kate progresses through this,"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"is that you've swapped to a 3B pencil."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"And a lot of people might not be aware"},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"that there are a number of different B pencils"},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"that are graded to harder leads to quite soft."},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"And

paper"},"757":{"dur":5,"text":"I don't usually, so I find I can get\nvery dark with the 3B."},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"And I like to do, as you can see\nbuilding it up here,"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"that base coat in the 2B."},"771":{"dur":4,"text":"And even though it looks flat at the moment,\nit also gives it a softness."},"775":{"dur":4,"text":"So that where the shadows meeting the light areas,"},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"when I come in with the 3B,\nits a little bit different with the mouth,"},"785":{"dur":6,"text":"but there's a rolling sensation rather than\nthe 3B coming in and meeting a hard edge."},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"So I'll get a nice softness\nby having that 2B underneath."},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"GRAEME : And with your work,"},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"it really does take a great deal\u2026"},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"KATE : It does.\nGRAEME : \u2026of effort to get it where it needs to go."},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think that's\nthe beauty of what it is as well."},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean even looking at the pictures\nof the elephants walking at the moment,"},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"and just with the pencil"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"you can see that you've gradiated out that dust"},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"and that perspective in the background."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"KATE : Yes.\nGRAEME : So you can see"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"the tonal effects all the way through it,\nwhich I think is wonderful."},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"KATE : Yes, that was an interesting piece\nto be able to do,"},"820":{"dur":5,"text":"and working with the pencil\nby using the pencil to its full capacity\u2026"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"GRAEME : Yeah.\nKATE : \u2026to get that bit of perspective

progress faster than others,\nbut it is a slow process."},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"GRAEME : But I think it's amazing\nthat you can see what you can do."},"845":{"dur":1,"text":"You know you hold up these pencils\u2026"},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"KATE : That's it.\nGRAEME : \u2026and then..."},"848":{"dur":4,"text":"a hundred hours later you've got\nthis magnificent drawing in front of

about it is"},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"they're the sort of most simple\nand fundamental tools"},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can use for artwork."},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"And you start with pencils"},"869":{"dur":7,"text":"and white paper and it's just then a bit of\nchoice and experience into what you produce,"},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"and then perseverance."},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"Yes there's a bit rolled into it\nbut it's a challenge as well\u2026"},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"GRAEME : Yeah.\nKATE : \u2026to get from an outline,"},"886":{"dur":1,"text":"and when I say, when I'm teaching,"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"I say it's actually an outline that you shade in."},"891":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's your choice and your experience"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"that you get to the
