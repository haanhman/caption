work."},"458":{"dur":4,"text":"All of those roles have a lot\nof leadership involved in them."},"462":{"dur":6,"text":"The first reason is because\npeople perceive you as a

process belongs\nto the parties."},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"It belongs to the parties and\nthey will craft it and come up"},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"with a unique and creative\noutcome, and I'm just there to"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"try to make sure everything\nworks effectively.\""},"490":{"dur":4,"text":"And the problem with that\ndiscourse is that that person"},"495":{"dur":4,"text":"saying that doesn't acknowledge\nthe extent to which they are"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"powerful in the process."},"502":{"dur":5,"text":"When you come into a process as\na facilitator or as a mediator"},"507":{"dur":6,"text":"or as an advocate or as a\nmanager, you are powerful."},"513":{"dur":4,"text":"You carry with you the power\nof experience, the power of"},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"insight, the power of your\npassion and your convictions."},"522":{"dur":4,"text":"And if we don't realize that we\nactually have that power, then"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"we don't realize all\nthe choices we have about"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"how we exercise it."},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's reason one."},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"Leadership is important\nfor us to think about because"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"we are leaders."},"538":{"dur":6,"text":"Reason number two is that we\nhave, at least in the aspect of"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"some of your work, which we\nwould call dispute resolution, a"},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of discourse of neutrality."},"552":{"dur":5,"text":"This idea that I'm just there\nto try to make sure everything"},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"happens in a fair way, and we\nwould, of course, be in favor of"},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"everything happening in a fair\nway, but I would argue"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"we're never neutral."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"We can't be fully neutral."},"571":{"dur":4,"text":"Indeed, when you work in special\neducation related processes,"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"you're not neutral at all."},"578":{"dur":3,"text":"You care about the integrity\nof those processes."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"You care about the quality\nof the services that are"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"going to be provided."},"587":{"dur":4,"text":"You care about strengthening\nrelations between parents and"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"schools and making sure that\nthose can be functional"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"in the future."},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"And those very convictions are\nthose things which will animate"},"600":{"dur":4,"text":"the processes

children"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"in specific situations."},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think sometimes that\ndiscourse of neutrality takes us"},"631":{"dur":5,"text":"a little bit away from the\nways that we are partial, those"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"positive ways that\nwe are partial."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"Of course, there's a bigger\ndiscourse about this."},"642":{"dur":4,"text":"If you look now at new research\nabout neuroscience and about the"},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"ways that our minds actually\nmirror, our minds and hearts"},"651":{"dur":4,"text":"actually mirror what's going on\nwith others in the room, we know"},"655":{"dur":4,"text":"that actually neutrality is more\nand more mythical, but we'll"},"660":{"dur":4,"text":"leave that provocative\ndimension aside for now."},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"The third reason that I think\nit's important for us to think"},"668":{"dur":10,"text":"about ourselves as leaders has\nto do with cultural fluency."},"678":{"dur":5,"text":"As Phil told you, I've cared\nfor a long time about cultural"},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"dimensions of conflicts\nand resolving conflicts."},"688":{"dur":4,"text":"And if you think about cultural\ndimensions, you begin to ask"},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"questions about who is involved\nin various processes, who feels"},"697":{"dur":5,"text":"at home, who feels estranged,\nwho feels included, who feels"},"702":{"dur":5,"text":"excluded, who feels cared about,\nwho feels cast to the side."},"708":{"dur":4,"text":"Cultural fluency, of course,\nmeans that we need to think"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"about processes in ways that\nask and answer those kinds of"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"questions, and that's one of the\nthings I'd like to explore"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"with you today."},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"And finally, we need to think\nabout ourselves as leaders"},"725":{"dur":5,"text":"because, as Bernie Mayer was\nsaying yesterday, when we are in"},"730":{"dur":5,"text":"conflict, our perceptions\ntend to narrow."},"735":{"dur":4,"text":"Our communication tends\nto become more rigid."},"740":{"dur":6,"text":"In short, we are least able to\nbe creative when we are really"},"746":{"dur":4,"text":"in the grip of conflict\nthan any other time."},"751":{"dur":5,"text":"And therefore, those of you who\nare in some way involved with"},"756":{"dur":6,"text":"trying to help resolve disputes\nrelated to special education or"},"762":{"dur":4,"text":"to create systems in which those\ndisputes can be handled well and"},"767":{"dur":5,"text":"effectively need to bring that\ncreativity to the table, need to"},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"bring that creativity to process\ndesign, and there again it's a"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"function of leadership."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"I've been kind of curious\nbecause, actually, if you go to"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"a business school, you hear\npeople talk about leadership"},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"all the time."},"787":{"dur":5,"text":"But when we get involved in work\nrelating to dispute resolution,"},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"people tend not to talk about\nleadership as much, and I think"},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"it is because we're afraid to\nactually say, \"Oh yes, we're a"},"801":{"dur":4,"text":"leader,\" because it is too\ncontrasting with some of our"},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"other ideas about neutrality and\nabout the way that parties"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"own the process."},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm very happy for\nparties to feel that they can"},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"meaningfully participate in\nprocesses and, at the same time,"},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"I want us to think about what\nare the implications of thinking"},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"about ourselves as leaders."},"826":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's the adventure\nI invite you into today."},"830":{"dur":5,"text":"And if we don't dance, we will\nat least find some ways to look"},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"at things from some\ndifferent perspectives."},"839":{"dur":6,"text":"So each of those four things:\nthe fact that we are leaders,"},"845":{"dur":5,"text":"which I relate to commitment and\ntherefore the element of earth;"},"850":{"dur":6,"text":"the fact that we are never\nneutral, which I would relate to"},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"collaboration and to thinking\nin a number of ways about how we"},"861":{"dur":5,"text":"collaborate, which I would\nrelate to the element of air;"},"866":{"dur":4,"text":"the fact that cultural fluency\nis very important to our work,"},"870":{"dur":4,"text":"working in diverse settings as\nalmost all of us do, I would"},"875":{"dur":4,"text":"relate to the element of water\nwhich, after all, finds its way"},"879":{"dur":5,"text":"around all of the rocks in the\nstream; and finally, the fact"},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"that creativity is important to\nour leadership and to our work I"},"889":{"dur":4,"text":"would relate to the element of\nfire and to the passion that we"},"894":{"dur":2,"text":"bring to our work\nand that creativity."},"896":{"dur":4,"text":"So we'll work with those four\nelements a bit this morning in"},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"what I hope will be an\ninteractive and interesting kind"},"904":{"dur":6,"text":"of exploration for you and for\nme because, as we discussed last"},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"night in the small group where\nI was in the reception, we don't"},"914":{"dur":3,"text":"want to do anything\nunless it's fun."},"918":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's see if we can't have fun\nthis morning for a few minutes."},"922":{"dur":4,"text":"So we'll think about\nthose four dimensions."},"926":{"dur":4,"text":"And we begin, then, before we\nwork with those four elements"},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"and four dimensions of\nleadership, if we might, with"},"934":{"dur":2,"text":"words from our sponsor."},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"Actually, with words\nfrom one of my mentors,"},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"whose name was Jim Laue."},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"And you may or may not know\nabout Jim Laue because Jim sadly"},"944":{"dur":4,"text":"passed away at age 56 before\nhe had had a chance to write"},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of things."},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"He was very busy doing\nthings in the world."},"954":{"dur":3,"text":"He worked with the Reverend\nDr. Martin Luther King and he"},"957":{"dur":5,"text":"did a lot of wonderful work on\npublic policy dispute resolution"},"962":{"dur":3,"text":"and would have cared a lot about\nissues that you care about."},"966":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said something that I\nthink is so important as a kind"},"970":{"dur":2,"text":"of anchor for this work."},"972":{"dur":5,"text":"He said, \"No process of conflict\nresolution should happen without"},"978":{"dur":6,"text":"asking how it will affect\nthose without voice or power.\""},"984":{"dur":4,"text":"He said, \"Justice is the\nultimate social good.\""},"989":{"dur":4,"text":"And again, this relates to the\ntopic of leadership because if"},"993":{"dur":5,"text":"we are not asking about those\nwithout voice or social power,"},"999":{"dur":3,"text":"then we are part of a\nsystem which is not"},"1002":{"dur":3,"text":"as just as it might be."},"1005":{"dur":3,"text":"So I want to invoke also\nJim's memory in thinking about"},"1009":{"dur":5,"text":"questions of justice and\nlinking them to leadership."},"1014":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, let's begin with the\nelement of earth, the question"},"1020":{"dur":6,"text":"of commitment, and the question\nof how we exercise leadership."},"1026":{"dur":4,"text":"And in order to do that, I'd\nlike to share with you a
