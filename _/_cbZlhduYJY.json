But it's not much because it's a very short duration where you pressing up against it"},"76":{"dur":3,"text":"now if you're leaving your hand on the\ngear shift while it's in gear"},"79":{"dur":3,"text":"what's happening is you could be\napplying pressure on that selector fork"},"83":{"dur":3,"text":"up against that collar so you've got a\nrotating component pressing up against"},"86":{"dur":0,"text":"that"},"87":{"dur":4,"text":"selector fork and you can wear out\nthat selector fork and so you don't want"},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"to be doing that.

So moving on to number two"},"124":{"dur":3,"text":"one bad habit is to leave it in gear\nwhile you're sitting at a stoplight so"},"128":{"dur":3,"text":"if you come up to a stoplight the best\nidea instead of just leaving it in gear"},"131":{"dur":3,"text":"take it out of here put it in neutral\nand let your foot off the clutch"},"135":{"dur":3,"text":"so why should you do this well here is\nthe pressure plate and this is the"},"139":{"dur":3,"text":"diaphragm spring and so this is what's\ngoing to be engaging and disengaging"},"142":{"dur":3,"text":"your clutch and so within your\ntransmission this is the throw out"},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"bearing and so when you push in that\nclutch pedal"},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"what you're doing is you're pushing the\nthrow out bearing up against this"},"150":{"dur":3,"text":"diaphragm spring and you're relieving\npressure so that it doesn't clamp down"},"154":{"dur":1,"text":"on that clutch disc"},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"so when you're sitting at a stoplight\nand you put it in gear"},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"what you're doing is you're pressing\nthis up against it and you can wear out"},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"these throw out bearing so it's\nunnecessary wear to just have it sitting"},"166":{"dur":1,"text":"there so you can just put it in neutral"},"167":{"dur":4,"text":"let out the clutch and then you know it\ncan sit there and it's not wearing up"},"171":{"dur":1,"text":"against it"},"173":{"dur":5,"text":"now the other thing is when you do have\nyour clutch engaged with it in neutral"},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"you're not gonna have your clutch\nspinning in there so you know if you did"},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"start to have some clearance issues with\nyour clutch"},"183":{"dur":3,"text":"you could have some premature wear just\nsitting there with an in gear"},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"rather than engaging it now people will\nargue hey you know you want to have it"},"190":{"dur":3,"text":"in gear just in case you need to get up\nand go or whatever but you know there's"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"plenty of scenarios where there's going\nto be a car in front of you a car behind"},"196":{"dur":3,"text":"things like that there's no need to just\nleave it in gear and it doesn't really"},"199":{"dur":3,"text":"take any time to put it into gear it's a\nvery quick thing to do"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"and the other thing people say it's like\nhey you know you might get rear-ended"},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"you want to have it in gear so that you\nknow if your foot comes off the clutch"},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"your vehicle stops it's like well you\nshould have your foot on the brake so if"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"you are going to get rounded your foots\nare going to be on the break I've had"},"216":{"dur":1,"text":"this happen to me twice"},"217":{"dur":4,"text":"unfortunately in my Subaru STi where\nI've been stopped with my foot on the"},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"brake cards in neutral and I've been hit\nfrom behind and it's not a big deal you"},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"know you keep your foot on the brake\nyour kind of natural reaction in an"},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"emergency situation like that is a\ntendency to break because you don't want"},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"to move you're not trying to move"},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"so your thought is I need to stop moving\nso you hit the brake when your foots"},"238":{"dur":3,"text":"already on it you know obviously you're\njust going to stay stopped but anyways"},"241":{"dur":4,"text":"the big point there with leaving it in\nneutral when you come to a stop light is"},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"to prevent premature wear of this throw\nout bearing which is going to be"},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"pressing up against that diaphragm\nspring"},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"moving on to number three you should\nnever use the clutch to hold yourself on"},"254":{"dur":3,"text":"a hill and this may seem pretty obvious\nbut plenty of people still do it where"},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"you basically feather the throttle and\nthe clutch pedal to get that sweet spot"},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"where your vehicle doesn't"},"263":{"dur":3,"text":"roll down the hill but what you're doing\nis you're burning up the friction"},"266":{"dur":4,"text":"material on your clutch disc so your\nclutch is spinning at one speed and your"},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"engines is the pressure plate here which\nsandwiches this clutch disc between the"},"274":{"dur":1,"text":"flywheel"},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"this is going to be rotating at another\nspeed based on your throttle"},"278":{"dur":5,"text":"so you're rotating this at one speed in\norder to bring this up to speed and in"},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"doing so you're just gonna be wearing\nout this friction material because this"},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"is rubbing up against the pressure plate\nand flywheel and so you're going to be"},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"wearing out your clutch and there's just\nabsolutely no reason to do that"},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"so instead what you should be doing is\njust holding the brake when you're on"},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"the hill that seems pretty obvious but\nthe next question is okay well how do I"},"301":{"dur":0,"text":"accelerate"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"well there's two things that you can do\nactually probably three things a lot of"},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"modern cars now come with break hold and\nso when you're on a hill and you have"},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"the clutch pressed in when you let your\nfoot off the brake"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"they'll tend to hold you now plenty of\nvehicles do not for example I don't"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"believe this nissan 370z has it"},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"and so in that case if it's not a big\nhill you know you can just kind of wait"},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"and then get on to the throttle fairly\nquickly bring out your clutch a little"},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"bit so you know you're ready to do that\nand have a transition you may roll a"},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"little bit back but not much where it\nmatters now the third scenario let's say"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"you're on a pretty steep hill and you\ndon't want to roll back because there's"},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"a car right behind you"},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"well what you're going to do is pull the\nbrake you've got your clutch pedal and"},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"your foot on the brake"},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"you can now let your foot off of the\nbreak assuming your brakes going to hold"},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"and so then what you want to do you can\nput it in gear now you're going to start"},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"to ease off of the clutch where it\nstarts to bite and you'll feel this"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"because the car is going to start to\ntalk a little bit and then you're going"},"353":{"dur":4,"text":"to let off the brake and then you're off\nnow it's a good idea to practice this on"},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"flat ground so you get the hang of it\nbefore you're actually on a hill and you"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"need to actually do it for real"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"so you know you can just find an empty\nparking lot something like that pull the"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"ebrake start to let the clutch out"},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"you can feel it start to grab let me\nbreak down and you accelerate you don't"},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"roll back at all"},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"number four"},"374":{"dur":4,"text":"didn't apply a lot of throttle when\nyou're not at a very high engine rpm"},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"so for example if you're in sixth year\nand I'm going 40 miles per hour right"},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"now it's not a good idea to floor it\nbecause what you're doing is you're"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"lugging the engine it's not a huge\ngearing disadvantage and you're telling"},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"it to accelerate as hard as it can and\nso you're kind of conflicting there"},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"so rather than you know flooring in 6th\ngear it's a much smarter idea don't be"},"396":{"dur":0,"text":"lazy"},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"just down shift if you need more than 50\nor you know go down the second gear if"},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"you need you can skip gear so long as\nyou rub match i have a separate video"},"404":{"dur":5,"text":"explaining that but it is important that\nyou know if you need to accelerate don't"},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"be lazy just down shift because you're\ngoing to lug the engine"},"413":{"dur":4,"text":"if you have it in you know 60 or 40\nmiles per hour in the engine RPMs are"},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"really low and you're telling it to work\nreally hard but it's that such a huge"},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"gearing disadvantage that it doesn't\nwork out it can cause problems and"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"finally number five"},"426":{"dur":4,"text":"one thing you don't want to do is while\nyou're driving rest your foot let's see"},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"here on the highway rest your foot on\nthe clutch pedal and that also seems"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"pretty obvious but it's also something\nthat some people commonly do and so"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"there are several reasons why don't want\nto do this first of all resting your"},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"foot on that clutch pedal means your\nclutch may not be fully engaged in so"},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"you can have a little bit of slip with\ntheir clutch disc"},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"you're not putting down full power and\nyou can be wearing out your clutch"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"another reason there is you can be\nwearing out your throw out bearing once"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"again because you're pressing that throw\nout bearing against the diaphragm spring"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"as i showed earlier in the video"},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"so those are five habits that may be\nfairly common for some people if you"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"don't fully understand how manual\ntransmission works"},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"hopefully that cleared up the confusion\nand hopefully you know you can learn"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"from that if you are applying any of\nthese bad driving techniques you know"},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"from time to time i'll always find\nmyself resting my hand on the gearshift"},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"lever it's not the end of the world you\nknow I'm not applying a ton of pressure"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"on and wearing out that fort but there\nare some little things like that"},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"what you may not always be thinking\nabout which you you know but should put"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"a little bit of thought into while\ndriving a manual transmission vehicle as"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"you could wear it out a little bit\nsooner"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"so thank you guys for watching and if\nyou have any questions or comments feel"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"free to leave those below"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"I guess it really need to make the\nnoises i mean it's got a great sounding engine."}}
