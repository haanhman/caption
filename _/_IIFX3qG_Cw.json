how"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"this applies to the workplace."},"381":{"dur":6,"text":"So before we go on, I'd like\nto start with the end in mind"},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"about where we're

that."},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"But what I want to\ndo is really create"},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"a spot, a spot that\nrepresents that place."},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's

years I threw\nmyself into that sport."},"719":{"dur":4,"text":"And the reason that I\nloved rock climbing so much"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"was because it put\nme in this flow
