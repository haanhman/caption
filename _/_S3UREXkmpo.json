consider\ncoming back on the set?"},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"And they were near the\nend of their shoot."},"829":{"dur":1,"text":"It was like 60 days."},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you know\nanything

says,\nsummer's last hurrah."},"870":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the first line."},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"And in that scene, there's\na shot right at Tim McGraw,"},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's when
