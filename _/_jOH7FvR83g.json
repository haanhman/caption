And it's also"},"679":{"dur":4,"text":"the number one, usually the number one and\nnumber two searched for terms in online dictionaries."},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"So we're gonna spend more than a little, a\nlittle bit significant time on 'affect' versus"},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"'effect'.\nSo there are exceptions to this rule. [giggles]"},"693":{"dur":5,"text":"And a few years ago I was on the Oprah Winfrey\nShow and I talked about this and again I was"},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"a little nervous and I forgot to say there\nwere exceptions. And I got a nasty e-mail."},"703":{"dur":4,"text":"Someone wrote, 'Thank you for confusing the\nwhole world.' [audience laughter] So I'm always"},"708":{"dur":5,"text":"really careful now to say there are exceptions.\nBut most people don't even know the basic"},"713":{"dur":6,"text":"rule. So if you get this part right, you'll\nbe right like 85% of the time and that's probably"},"719":{"dur":4,"text":"better than you're doing now. Some of you.\n[audience chuckles] I'm sure some of you have"},"724":{"dur":7,"text":"it down. But 'affect' is usually a verb and\n'effect' is usually a noun. So Aardvark is"},"731":{"dur":5,"text":"a character in my book. Aardvark and Squiggly\nare buddies and they fish together and stuff."},"737":{"dur":7,"text":"So I, I,the first memory trick I came up with\nuses this sentence because it's all A's. So"},"744":{"dur":6,"text":"Aardvark is our friend and it's all A's. \u00ebThe\narrows affected Aardvark.\u00ed And 'affected'"},"750":{"dur":6,"text":"is a verb in that sentence. The arrows are\ntaking an action on Aardvark. They're affecting"},"757":{"dur":7,"text":"him. And you can see that it's a verb by substituting\nother verbs and they work in the sentence,"},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"that's a little trick I often use. If I don't\nknow what kind of word to use, I'll substitute"},"768":{"dur":5,"text":"similar words and see if it makes sense. So\nthe arrows affected aardvark. The arrows hit"},"774":{"dur":5,"text":"Aardvark. They poked Aardvark. And they annoyed\nAardvark. Those are all verbs. So if you can"},"779":{"dur":6,"text":"remember that sentence, you can compare it\nto a sentence you're trying to write and see"},"785":{"dur":5,"text":"if it's kinda like that sentence. And that's\none way to, to choose the right word and remember"},"791":{"dur":4,"text":"that 'affected', the verb, starts with an\n'A' because the arrows affected Aardvark."},"796":{"dur":7,"text":"Now a second memory trick that some people\nseem to like better is 'affect' is for verbs"},"804":{"dur":5,"text":"and verbs are actions. And both 'affect' and\n'action' start with the letter A. And you"},"810":{"dur":4,"text":"can see these kids, they're, they're affecting\nthe balls. They're taking action on the balls."},"815":{"dur":7,"text":"They're making craziness happen to the balls.\nSo then 'effect' is the noun. And this is"},"822":{"dur":7,"text":"the example sentence with all E's for the\nnoun. The effect was eye-popping. The effect,"},"829":{"dur":5,"text":"the thing that happened to Aardvark, the noun,\nwas eye-popping. And you can see that is a"},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"noun by substituting other nouns in the sentence.\nSo the blood was eye-popping. The holes were"},"839":{"dur":5,"text":"eye-popping. And the sound, the sound Aardvark\nmade, was eye-popping. So those are example"},"844":{"dur":7,"text":"sentences where one uses 'affect' the verb\nand the other one uses 'effect' the noun."},"852":{"dur":7,"text":"So another trick is that nouns can usually\ntake an article. So 'the effect was eye-popping'."},"860":{"dur":6,"text":"'She loved the effect the light had on the\npaintings.' And 'the lightning effects were"},"866":{"dur":5,"text":"amazing.' So you can see, in the final one,\nthere's a word that comes between the article"},"872":{"dur":4,"text":"and the noun. It's modifying 'effects'. It's\ntelling you what kind of effects they were."},"876":{"dur":5,"text":"But you can still put an article in front\nof 'effect'. When, when what you want is the"},"882":{"dur":5,"text":"noun, you can usually put an article in front\nof it. It doesn\u00edt work at all with the verb."},"887":{"dur":5,"text":"So you can't say, 'The arrows the affected\nAardvark' [audience murmurs] 'He was the affected"},"893":{"dur":5,"text":"by the layoffs.' That doesn't make any sense.\nIt's not even remotely grammatical. So if"},"898":{"dur":5,"text":"you can put an article like 'the' in front\nof the word, then the one you want is 'effect'"},"904":{"dur":6,"text":"with an E. And the way I remember it is that\n'the' ends with E. And 'effect' starts with"},"910":{"dur":4,"text":"E. So if you have those two E's that can butt\nup against each other, then you want the word"},"915":{"dur":5,"text":"that starts with the E. [pause]\nAnd this is the memory trick that actually"},"921":{"dur":6,"text":"works for me. It doesn't work for a lot of\npeople but I'll share it with you anyway."},"927":{"dur":3,"text":"[laughs] To some people, some people do say,\n'Oh that's my favorite one.' So, I remember"},"931":{"dur":6,"text":"'affect \u00f1 verb; effect \u00f1 noun'. It's a mnemonic\n\u00f1 A-V-E-N. And you can make words with A-V-E-N."},"937":{"dur":5,"text":"So I always think of a raven because you can\nspell raven 'R-A-V-E-N'. So if you can think"},"943":{"dur":4,"text":"of that raven in your head and you try to\nremember which is the verb and which is the"},"947":{"dur":5,"text":"noun, then you have 'affect - verb; effect-noun'.\nSo just think of that black raven on the yellow"},"953":{"dur":5,"text":"background and you'll have it forever.\nSo that was one of my early memory, early"},"959":{"dur":5,"text":"tricks, one of my early tips, one of the first\nthings I covered. And then I realized, people"},"964":{"dur":6,"text":"starting asking me about 'affective' versus\n'effective'. Like it gets harder. So effective"},"971":{"dur":5,"text":"is almost always the word you want. 'She's\na particularly effective leader.' 'We had"},"976":{"dur":7,"text":"an effective meeting. And \u00ebEffective immediately,\nwe'll have coffee at every meeting.' So really"},"983":{"dur":6,"text":"almost the only time you want to use 'affective'\nwith an A is when you're talking about a disease."},"990":{"dur":7,"text":"So, or something in psychology. So I grew\nup in Seattle. So seasonal affective disorder,"},"997":{"dur":7,"text":"little children with their, their chins on\nwindow sills looking out at the rain. So seasonal"},"1004":{"dur":6,"text":"affective disorder is an example of when you\nwould use 'affective' with an A. But most"},"1010":{"dur":5,"text":"of the time, it's 'effective' with an E that\nyou want."},"1016":{"dur":4,"text":"So, so that's the end of the 'affect' versus\n'effect' section. Hope I've given you some"},"1021":{"dur":6,"text":"memory tricks to remember. And then it sort\nof leads into the next thing because 'impact',"},"1027":{"dur":8,"text":"when people don't know whether to use 'affect',\nthey often use 'impact' and that bothers probably"},"1035":{"dur":6,"text":"20% of the population. Twenty, 80% of the\npeople have no idea about this but 20% of"},"1041":{"dur":5,"text":"the people, when you talk about 'impact' as\na verb, 'The weather impacted fourth quarter"},"1047":{"dur":5,"text":"sales', people like lose their minds. They\nhate it. So it, 'impact' as a noun is okay."},"1053":{"dur":5,"text":"You can say 'The weather had an impact on\nfourth quarter sales'. But as a verb, it's"},"1058":{"dur":4,"text":"better to avoid it. And now you know how to\nuse 'affect'. You can say 'The weather affected"},"1062":{"dur":5,"text":"fourth quarter sales.' You don't have to worry\nabout this. But when you say 'impact', the"},"1068":{"dur":3,"text":"sticklers, they think of 'impact' only means\nto hit.

Oh I've had people call,\nwhen I was doing radio interviews, and they\u00edll"},"1087":{"dur":5,"text":"say, 'I think of impacted teeth. Or even like\nan impacted colon.' [audience laughter] You"},"1093":{"dur":4,"text":"do not want people thinking about that when\nthey're reading your writing. It's just better"},"1097":{"dur":4,"text":"to avoid it.\nSo that's that. Okay. And then, okay. Moving"},"1102":{"dur":4,"text":"on. Another common thing that you may or may\nnot know you do but that bothers a lot of"},"1107":{"dur":8,"text":"people is using 'they' or 'their' as a singular\npronoun. So, absolutely, the language is evolving."},"1115":{"dur":6,"text":"So that in 50 years, it won't be an issue.\nYou can use, people already use 'they' and"},"1122":{"dur":3,"text":"'their' as singular pronouns in speech all\nthe time.
