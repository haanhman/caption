That's it?"},"689":{"dur":7,"text":">> Well I want to thank you Phil,\nfor not only that introduction,"},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"but for coming up with the idea to make\nthis our classroom here at

I want to start if we can by\nsetting some facts on the ground,"},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"there has been a lot of confusion\nabout the different programs,"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"surveillance programs that Ed Snowden\nhas revealed in the past year."},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"In particular, the distinction between\nthe telephone meta data program,"},"721":{"dur":5,"text":"which policy wonks know under section 215,\nand the Internet communications program"},"726":{"dur":6,"text":"under section 702, can you lay out for us\nin layman's terms what these programs do?"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":">> Sure\n>> And how they do it?"},"734":{"dur":1,"text":">> Yeah."},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"As Amy suggests, 215 program has\nto do with telephone meta data."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's not email traffic, it's voice."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's not content, it's fact of."},"746":{"dur":9,"text":"And so what the Agency gathers is\nwho called whom, when, for how long."},"756":{"dur":6,"text":"It's also within the technical definition\nof metadata to include locational data but"},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"this program doesn't, okay,\nit's consciously excluded."},"766":{"dur":4,"text":"So what you've got is\na record of all phone"},"771":{"dur":5,"text":"calls made within the United States, or\nbetween the united States and overseas."},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"It's given to the National Security Agency\non a daily basis by the telecom providers."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"It is not technically\nelectronic surveillance, it"},"783":{"dur":5,"text":"is not even metaphorically alligator clips\non some wire somewhere getting signals."},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"These are actually business records\nkept by the phone company in"},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"order to charge you for your phone usage."},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"That pipe, that data is then bent\ntowards the National Security Agency,"},"801":{"dur":0,"text":"where it is stored."},"803":{"dur":5,"text":"Key point about this is that\nit is unarguably domestic."},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"It's your stuff, it's my stuff."},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's put into this large database."},"814":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, that in itself causes a lot of\npeople concern, because, you know,"},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"even with good intent, there's some\nnervousness about the government having"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"that kind of information."},"824":{"dur":6,"text":"The NSA view is that, although that\nis kind of theoretically frightening,"},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"as a practical matter, one has to\nlook at what happens to that data,"},"834":{"dur":3,"text":"in order to make a coherent\njudgement about it."},"837":{"dur":6,"text":"It has to of what you've got here, are the\nrecords of phone calls as I've described,"},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"between and among us, and between us and"},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"overseas, either originating overseas,\nor originating here."},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"That data is locked and"},"853":{"dur":6,"text":"inaccessible at NSA except under\na very narrow set of circumstances."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"Now number one,\nthe number of people who are allowed to"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"access that data is about two thou,\ntwo dozen."},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"Actually the right number is 22,\nall right?"},"867":{"dur":5,"text":"And the way you access\nthe data is through a number,"},"873":{"dur":6,"text":"almost always foreign, about which you\nhave a reasonable, articutable suspicion"},"880":{"dur":4,"text":"that the foreign number is\naffiliated with terrorist groups."},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"Specific example."},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"So you, you raid a safe house in Yemen."},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"And, you go in and you."},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"With your Yemeni allies."},"893":{"dur":1,"text":"And you, you grab some people."},"894":{"dur":1,"text":"And you grab what's called pocket litter,\nwhich is."},"896":{"dur":4,"text":"Identifiable stuff inside,\ninside their pockets confirms that yeah,"},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"these guys are who we, they,\nwho we though they were."},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"They're aff, affiliated with AQAP,\nAl-Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula or"},"908":{"dur":1,"text":"some other group."},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"And you discover a cell phone\nthat you'd never seen before."},"914":{"dur":3,"text":"Now you have a reasonable\narticulable suspicion that,"},"917":{"dur":4,"text":"that cell phone is in fact\naffiliated with the terrorists."},"922":{"dur":1,"text":"What you then get to do, and, and"},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to be a little cartoonish here,\nbut this is kind of how it works."},"927":{"dur":3,"text":"What you then get to do is\nwalk up to that database,"},"931":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of yell through the transom."},"933":{"dur":2,"text":"Say hey,\nanybody in here talk to this phone?"},"937":{"dur":3,"text":"And then if a number in the Bronx\nkind of raises its hand and"},"940":{"dur":3,"text":"says, well yeah, I do every Thursday."},"945":{"dur":3,"text":"NSA then gets to say to that a number in\nthe Bronx, well then who do you talk to?"},"951":{"dur":1,"text":"That's it."},"952":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the program."},"954":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no mining of the data,"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"there's no pattern development,\nno pattern recognition."},"959":{"dur":5,"text":"It is, did any of those, did any of those\nphone events that were captured there"},"965":{"dur":5,"text":"relate to a phone that we have reason\nto believe is affiliated with Al Qaeda?"},"970":{"dur":2,"text":"The last year I've seen\nstatistics is 2012,"},"973":{"dur":3,"text":"and that,\nhey anybody in here talk to this phone."},"978":{"dur":3,"text":"Happened 228 time."},"981":{"dur":2,"text":"That's 215 meta

seven to two is, is about content."},"1010":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's about emails."},"1011":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's about emails who are re,\nwhich are residing in the United

the travel region of Pakistan."},"1119":{"dur":3,"text":"And they were using Gmail to do it,"},"1122":{"dur":5,"text":"because Gmail's cheap,\nubiquitous, it works."},"1128":{"dur":3,"text":"The only
