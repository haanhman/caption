interested in more."},"416":{"dur":4,"text":"So, what I like to tell people\nis that there is hope."},"421":{"dur":4,"text":"I do see hope of a China being able\nto go green fast enough."},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is because the change\nis not happening linearly."},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"Part of this is because\nof the mentality of China"},"434":{"dur":4,"text":"to be able to throw spaghetti on the wall,\nsee what clean tech models will stick,"},"438":{"dur":4,"text":"and then be able to scale them\nacross the country very quickly."},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll give you a very simple example."},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"In July 2008, after China had\nexperimented in a couple cities"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"with banning free plastic bags:"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"July 2008, one day, boom!"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"No more free plastic bags\nacross the country."},"458":{"dur":4,"text":"So, those are simple things\nthat China can do to go green."},"462":{"dur":5,"text":"This type of experimental\nattitude started in the 1980s"},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"after the cultural and economic slate\nof China was wiped clean,"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"they started to rebuild 30 years ago."},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"And in the 1980s, they started\ncreating these special economic zones."},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"One that

science parks,\ndifferent high techs zones,"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"industrial zones, more\nspecial economic zones, etc."},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"So, China is not afraid to fail"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"because it puts these special\nzones at arm's length, and says,"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"\"It's OK if you fail,\nbut the ones that do win,"},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"we will showcase\nand celebrate across the country.\""},"509":{"dur":5,"text":"So I'll give you a simple example\nof how quickly China can move."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"Three years ago in JUCCCE,"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"one of our key spots\nthat we focused on is smart grid,"},"520":{"dur":5,"text":"so revolutionizing the electrical grid\nto be more efficient, to use less energy,"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"and to be able to carry\nmore wind and solar."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"So three years ago,"},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"we started approaching\nthe government officials in China,"},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"responsible for the grid,"},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"and their response\nto our presentation about smart grid is,"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"\"What is smart grid?\""},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"Are you talking about electric vehicles"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"because if you are,\nthere\u2019s probably ten years out,"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's probably too early\nto come talk to us."},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"You probably know"},"550":{"dur":4,"text":"electrical vehicles are on the forefront\nof clean tech industry in China today,"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"and this was just three years ago."},"556":{"dur":4,"text":"So, what happened was JUCCCE,\nin 2008, joined up with Duke Energy,"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"and many other companies,\nand NGOs, and national labs,"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"to create the JUCCCE China\nsmart grid cooperative"},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"and bring solutions to the state grid,"},"570":{"dur":4,"text":"and it's interesting, because in China,\nthere's only a handful of people"},"575":{"dur":5,"text":"that you need to reach to convince,\nto create great change."},"580":{"dur":5,"text":"There's only two utilities in China\nversus, let's say, 3,000 in the US."},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"Of those utilities, one is\nthe Goliath vs the David,"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"and covers 88% of the grid."},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"And inside that State grid\nthere was, at that time,"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"only one organization that looked\nat new technologies like smart grid,"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"the CEPRI group,"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"and within that, there's really only\nfew people that dealt with foreigners."},"606":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, by bringing in\nall of these experts, in person,"},"610":{"dur":4,"text":"live, in Beijing, to talk with them,\nit created great change very rapidly."},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"And that let to a road map in May 2009"},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"to launch the state grid,\nsmart grid road map"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"to implement smart grid\nacross the country by 2020,"},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"and they've put 7 million dollars\nbehind this effort already."},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"So they can move very, very quickly."},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"The other reason why\nChina is very effective"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"is because of the clustering effect."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"So a couple of interesting examples\nin this small town of Wenzhou,"},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"which is a very rich\nlight manufacturing town,"},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"part of that creates cigarette lighters,"},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"and 70% of the cigarette lighters\nin the world are generated"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"from this one town."},"654":{"dur":6,"text":"In that same city, there's a part\ncalled Qiaotou, the \"button city\""},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"that creates almost two thirds\nof all buttons in the world."},"663":{"dur":6,"text":"So what China is able to do\nis bring all of these people"},"669":{"dur":4,"text":"who are thinking about a specific part\nof clean tech into one area,"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"and all of those juices flowing creates"},"677":{"dur":4,"text":"sort of great experiments,\na great environment for innovation."},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"Quick piloting process\nis also key to China."},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"So, in the last three years, again\n- I'll talk about electric vehicles -"},"690":{"dur":4,"text":"first, they started with\n13 pilot cities, a couple years ago,"},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"and then, they added another 20 cities\nto experiment on electric vehicles,"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"recently this year,\nthey announced another five cities"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"that they would create subsidies\nfor private purchases"},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"of electric vehicles, and car chargers,\nand battery recycling centers."},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"High speed rail, you might have heard\nof the Maglev in Shanghai,"},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"using German technology."},"715":{"dur":6,"text":"We've already build\n6,500 kilometers of high speed rail,"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"and over the next 10 years, by 2020,"},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"we'll build another [16,000] kilometers."},"729":{"dur":5,"text":"That's a lot of high speed rail,\nhundreds of billions of RMB"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"going into that investment,\nso very quick scale up."},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"The last piloting effort\nthat I'll share with you,"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"although there are many in China,"},"743":{"dur":5,"text":"is recently in August, they announced\neight pilot cities for low carbon cities."},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"This is, basically, allowing mayors\nand party secretaries to do"},"752":{"dur":5,"text":"anything they want to figure out how\nyou can create a low carbon city in China."},"757":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is probably the ultimate\nclean tech experiment going on"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"starting today, in China."},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"They're searching\n- from all across the world -"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"for solutions to bring\ninto these experiments."},"770":{"dur":4,"text":"All of them have the freedom to do\ndifferent combinations of solutions."},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"But what's going to happen is"},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"one of these pilots are going to hit\n- one or more of them -"},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"they're going to be commercially viable"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"and China, with this sort\nof manufacturing mentality,"},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"is going to be able to deploy\nthis at large scale within China."},"789":{"dur":5,"text":"The challenge is how can you then,\ntake these solutions, these technologies"},"794":{"dur":5,"text":"and actually, scale them around the world\nto create low cost sustainable solutions"},"800":{"dur":4,"text":"that can be deployable at large scale\nanywhere in the world;"},"804":{"dur":5,"text":"that's the hope\nfor China's clean tech laboratory."},"809":{"dur":4,"text":"The other reason why China, I think, has\na really good environment for doing this,"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"is because they have\na lot of low cost capital,"},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"and this is not because there's a lot\nof money floating around in China."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"The reason really is\nbecause prioritization."},"823":{"dur":5,"text":"And starting in the 1980s, with programs\nlike 863, or 973, Spark, and Torch,"},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"our national level R&D programs put"},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"billions of dollars\ninto clean tech research."},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"And they are able to pull off\nthese types of large scale"},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"solar farms, wind farms,\nthings that need a lot of money."},"841":{"dur":4,"text":"And they are able to buy at wholesale\nvery expensive high tech solutions"},"846":{"dur":3,"text":"from places like Germany\nto create these types of solar panels."},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"They can move very quickly\nbecause of the decision making power"},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"within the mayor and\nthe Party Secretary's grasp."},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the mayors, I like to call them,\nkings of the kingdoms."},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"They're not like mayors in the west,"},"865":{"dur":4,"text":"they can give you fast approvals,\nif they are interested in our project."},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"This is Yangzhou, where last June and July"},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"we did a smart grid forum,\na two-day forum."},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"And Jiang Zemin, who was\nthe former Head of China,"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"this is his hometown,\nand he called the mayor and said,"},"882":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Smart grid is a fantastic opportunity\nfor Yangzhou, what will you do about it?\""},"886":{"dur":6,"text":"So the mayor then carved out five acres\nwithin the economic development zone,"},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"and within nine months JUCCCE was back,"},"894":{"dur":4,"text":"after working with them to bring\nour partners to these five acres,"},"899":{"dur":3,"text":"to launch China's first\nsmart grid business hub."},"902":{"dur":4,"text":"So, nine months, one building, 12,000 m2\nof smart grid exhibition center,"},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"five acres, a dormitory,\nand an office center,"},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"so phenomenal power to move quickly."},"912":{"dur":1,"text":"We also have low cost of labor"},"914":{"dur":3,"text":"that allows us to build\nthese things very quickly."},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"I was recently at the\nWorld Economic Forum, in Tianjin,"},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"and this conference center,\nthis huge sort of cavernous building,"},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"was built in nice months,\nit was quite incredible."},"927":{"dur":2,"text":"China actually really likes\nto build these showcases"},"930":{"dur":4,"text":"because they realize is not enough\nto have R&D or progressive policy,"},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"but you need to change\nthe hearts and minds of people,"},"938":{"dur":2,"text":"you need to have something\nthat people can aspire to."},"941":{"dur":5,"text":"So this is the Beijing Olympics, in 2008,\nand that was sort of a really star"},"946":{"dur":5,"text":"in the sort of green showcase cap,\nthe feather in the cap of China."},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"And this year, of course,\nwe have the Shanghai Expo,"},"954":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Better city, better life\"."},"956":{"dur":4,"text":"These things show the average citizen\nthat is OK to sacrifice today"},"960":{"dur":4,"text":"if we know that is a better future\naround the corner."},"964":{"dur":2,"text":"And again, China is changing\nevery five years,"},"967":{"dur":5,"text":"I can tell you that my block in five years\nis going to be completely different,"},"973":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not going to be able to recognize it."},"978":{"dur":4,"text":"The interesting thing about China is\nhow does it actually disseminate this"},"983":{"dur":3,"text":"or deploy these models\nthat work across the country."},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, you might not know"},"989":{"dur":3,"text":"these government officials\nhave mandated training,"},"993":{"dur":1,"text":"so we worked with one of the ministries,"},"995":{"dur":2,"text":"the Ministry of Housing\nand Urban Rural Development,"},"998":{"dur":2,"text":"that together with\nthe Central Organization Department,"},"1000":{"dur":4,"text":"which promotes the government\nofficials to their next job,"},"1005":{"dur":2,"text":"have a National Academy\nfor mayors of China"},"1007":{"dur":4,"text":"and each of these mayors, vice mayors,\nhave to take 12 days of training a year,"},"1012":{"dur":4,"text":"then every five years, they have to take\na total of three months of training."},"1017":{"dur":4,"text":"And we bring curriculum\non energy smart cities to them in Beijing."},"1021":{"dur":4,"text":"So, through these types of training,\nwe could train in the last two years,"},"1025":{"dur":3,"text":"150 mayors that represent\nover 300 million people,"},"1028":{"dur":1,"text":"and 50 state owned enterprises."},"1030":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is a tremendous channel,\na distribution channel for solutions"},"1035":{"dur":4,"text":"that come from China but also\ncome from the rest of the world."},"1040":{"dur":3,"text":"Think of China as a corporation,"},"1043":{"dur":6,"text":"where the Premier, Wen Jiabao, Hu Jintao,\nare the Chairman and the CEO,"},"1049":{"dur":4,"text":"so again, China today is not\nthe communist party you have in your mind."},"1054":{"dur":5,"text":"It's really the most capitalist society\nI've ever lived in, coming from America."},"1059":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"1063":{"dur":4,"text":"What I want to share with you\nis that China is changing,"},"1067":{"dur":4,"text":"is changing from the factory of the world\nto the clean tech laboratory of the world."},"1072":{"dur":4,"text":"And It is going to need new forms of\npartnership to make this vision a reality."},"1077":{"dur":4,"text":"There are certain things that China\nstill lacks in its developing, internally,"},"1082":{"dur":2,"text":"the ability to do radical innovation,"},"1085":{"dur":2,"text":"so our educational\nsystem is rote learning,"},"1087":{"dur":4,"text":"so this creative, out of the box thinking\nreally is coming from outside in,"},"1091":{"dur":4,"text":"whether is foreigners\nor returnees, \"Sea Turtles\"."},"1096":{"dur":4,"text":"We are better at tweak ovation\nrather than radical innovation,"},"1100":{"dur":5,"text":"so if you take something\nlike KFC, we will give you"},"1105":{"dur":5,"text":"a dish of deep fried chicken\nwith rice and sweet and sour on the side."},"1111":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we are looking for is solutions,"},"1114":{"dur":2,"text":"people who know how to\nintegrate solutions,"},"1116":{"dur":1,"text":"who know how to deploy

deploy\nat large scale across the country."},"1136":{"dur":3,"text":"One quick example\nthat you have is Lake Taupo"},"1140":{"dur":3,"text":"with one of the largest forest\nin the southern
