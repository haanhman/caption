affording"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"it."},"410":{"dur":5,"text":"And a world-class education means preparing\nevery young person with the skills they need"},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"for college, for a career, and for a lifetime\nof citizenship."},"419":{"dur":5,"text":"So what we did was we launched a new competition,\nbacked by America's Departments of Education"},"425":{"dur":5,"text":"and Labor, to start redesigning some of our\nhigh schools."},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"We call it Youth CareerConnect."},"433":{"dur":6,"text":"And we're offering $100 million in new grants\nto help schools and local partners develop"},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"and test new curricula and models for success."},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"We want to invest in your future."},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"You guys are all

the"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"world."},"457":{"dur":5,"text":"Young people in India and China, they're all\ninterested in trying to figure out how they"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"get a foothold in this world economy."},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"That's who you're competing against."},"467":{"dur":9,"text":"Now, I'm confident you can match or exceed\nanything they do, but we don't do it by just"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"resting on what we've done before."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"We've got to out-work and out-innovate and\nout-hustle everybody else."},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"We've got to think about new ways of doing\nthings."},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"And part of our concern has been our high\nschools, a lot of them were designed with"},"488":{"dur":9,"text":"curriculums based on the 1940s and '50s and\n'60s, and haven't been updated."},"497":{"dur":5,"text":"So the idea behind this competition is how\ndo we start making high school, in particular,"},"503":{"dur":5,"text":"more interesting, more exciting, more relevant\nto young people."},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"Last year, for example, I visited a school\ncalled P-TECH --- this is in Brooklyn -- a"},"513":{"dur":6,"text":"high school that partnered with IBM and the\nCity University of New York to offer its students"},"519":{"dur":4,"text":"not only a high school diploma, but also an\nassociate's degree in computer systems or"},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"electromechanical engineering."},"527":{"dur":4,"text":"IBM said that P-TECH graduates would be the\nfirst in line for jobs."},"532":{"dur":4,"text":"Then I visited a high school in Nashville\nthat offers \"academies\" where students focus"},"537":{"dur":4,"text":"on a specific subject area -- but they're\nalso getting hands-on experience running their"},"541":{"dur":7,"text":"own credit union, working in their own TV\nstudios, learning 3D printing, tinkering with"},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"their own airplane -- which was pretty cool."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"I never got to do that."},"554":{"dur":4,"text":"I did get my own airplane later in life."},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"(Laughter.)"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"Although I've got to give it back."},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter.)"},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't get to keep it."},"569":{"dur":6,"text":"But this is stuff I didn't get to do when\nI was in high school -- and I wish I had."},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"But it's stuff you have to know how to do\ntoday, in today's economy."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"Things are moving faster, they're more sophisticated."},"583":{"dur":5,"text":"So we challenged America's high schools to\nlook at what's happening in a place like P-TECH,"},"588":{"dur":5,"text":"look at what's happening in cities like Nashville,\nand then say what can you do to make sure"},"594":{"dur":6,"text":"your students learn the skills that businesses\nare looking for in high-demand fields."},"600":{"dur":6,"text":"And we asked high schools to develop partnerships\nwith colleges and employers, and create classes"},"606":{"dur":6,"text":"that focus on real-life applications for the\nfields of the future -- fields like science"},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"and technology and engineering and math."},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"And part of the reason we have to do this\nnow is because other countries, they've got"},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"a little bit of a lead on us on some of these\nareas."},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"A country like Germany right now focuses on\ngraduating their high school students with"},"628":{"dur":5,"text":"a technical degree equivalent that give them\na head start."},"633":{"dur":5,"text":"So we're asking schools to look into what\nplaces like Germany are doing."},"639":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, not every school that enters into this\ncompetition for the $100 million is going"},"646":{"dur":5,"text":"to win -- because we don't have enough money\nfor everybody, and we want to force schools"},"651":{"dur":5,"text":"to think hard and redesign, and we want to\nreward the schools that are being most innovative"},"656":{"dur":5,"text":"and are actually proving some of the concepts\nthat they're trying out."},"662":{"dur":5,"text":"But the great thing is that through this competition,\nschools across the country that entered have"},"668":{"dur":5,"text":"changed the way they prepare their students,\nand have already made enormous improvements,"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"even before they get the grant."},"675":{"dur":5,"text":"And, ultimately, we had to choose the top\nYouth CareerConnect initiatives."},"681":{"dur":5,"text":"Today, I'm proud to say that schools across\nAmerica are putting up some pretty impressive"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"proposals."},"689":{"dur":5,"text":"The winners across the board are doing the\nkinds of stuff that will allow other schools"},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"to start duplicating what they're doing."},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"The winners in Indianapolis are expanding\ntheir career prep programs to encourage more"},"702":{"dur":6,"text":"young women and kids from diverse backgrounds\nto join our science and technology workforce."},"708":{"dur":5,"text":"New York City likes that Brooklyn high school\nmodel, P-TECH, so much that they're using"},"713":{"dur":5,"text":"their grant to fund two more just like it,\nso that students can gain two degrees at once"},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"and get the edge they need in today's high-tech,\nhigh-speed economy."},"723":{"dur":5,"text":"And as I mentioned earlier, one of our 24\nwinners is a three-school team including your"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"high school."},"730":{"dur":7,"text":"Mustangs, you guys are part of the team that\nwon!"},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"(Applause.)"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"That's good."},"740":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, in part, the reason you won is because\nyou guys were ahead of the curve."},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"You were already winning."},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"For a couple years now, your career academies\nhave been integrating classroom learning with"},"753":{"dur":5,"text":"ready-to-work skills, and you're preparing\nstudents to move directly into the in-demand"},"759":{"dur":5,"text":"jobs of the future -- jobs in IT and biosciences\nand hospitality."},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"And now you're stepping it up."},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"You're taking it to another level."},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"So in the classroom I just visited, you had\n10th graders -- although there was also a"},"772":{"dur":9,"text":"freshman -- who are studying epidemiology\n-- the study of disease patterns and outbreaks."},"781":{"dur":7,"text":"And they're getting potentially college-level\ncredit for it, which is good because they"},"788":{"dur":6,"text":"may be the young people who discover a cure\nfor some disease down the line that we don't"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"even know about yet."},"798":{"dur":5,"text":"I know our brilliant scientists at the National\nInstitutes of Health and the Centers for Disease"},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"Control, they'd be proud of you."},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"They like looking at bacteria."},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter.)"},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"And I got a little worried when I went into\nthe classroom -- everybody was wearing goggles"},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"and vests, and I didn't have my goggles."},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter.)"},"817":{"dur":4,"text":"But they assured me it was safe."},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"But some of you Mustangs are pushing yourselves\nto get industry-recognized certifications"},"825":{"dur":5,"text":"in nursing, while other students on this winning\nteam are studying cutting-edge technology"},"830":{"dur":4,"text":"and getting hands-on internship experience\nat local businesses."},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"And we know these are skills that will be\nin demand."},"838":{"dur":6,"text":"Companies will come looking to hire you because\nof the experiences you've gotten here."},"844":{"dur":5,"text":"If you're focused, if you're working hard,\nyou now have a platform so that by the time"},"849":{"dur":4,"text":"you get out of high school you're already\nahead of the game; you're already in a position"},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"where you've got some skills that make you\nemployable."},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"And then you can just take it further, whether\nit's a two-year college or a four-year college,"},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"or graduate school."},"864":{"dur":7,"text":"Or there are a couple of young ladies in there\nwho said they want to be neurosurgeons, psychiatrists."},"871":{"dur":5,"text":"So you can build on these careers, but the\npoint is you have a baseline where you know"},"877":{"dur":6,"text":"if you're focused here at this school, doing\nyour work, you're going to be able to find"},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"a job."},"885":{"dur":8,"text":"And the grants that you've won in this Youth\nCareerConnect competition mean that the programs"},"893":{"dur":5,"text":"you've started are going to expand, and you're\ngoing to get more college and career counseling"},"899":{"dur":5,"text":"to help get you a jump on your post-high school\nplans."},"904":{"dur":6,"text":"So a little over four years from now, Bladensburg\nand your partner schools will graduate hundreds"},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"more students with the knowledge and skills\nthat you'll need to succeed."},"913":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's what we want for all the young\npeople here."},"916":{"dur":4,"text":"We want an education that engages you; we\nwant an education that equips you with the"},"921":{"dur":6,"text":"rigorous and relevant skills for college and\nfor a career."},"927":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'm confident -- meeting these young people,\nthey were incredible."},"931":{"dur":5,"text":"And a couple of them giggled a little bit\nwhen I walked in, but after they kind of settled"},"937":{"dur":9,"text":"down -- (laughter) -- they were -- they knew\ntheir stuff, and they were enjoying it."},"946":{"dur":7,"text":"And that's part of the message I've got for\nall the young people here today, is your potential"},"954":{"dur":6,"text":"for success is so high as long as you stay\nfocused."},"960":{"dur":4,"text":"As long as you're clear about your goals,\nyou're going to succeed."},"965":{"dur":7,"text":"And my message to the older people here -- like\nme -- is we've got a collective responsibility"},"972":{"dur":3,"text":"to make sure that you're getting those opportunities."},"976":{"dur":4,"text":"And there are resources out there that we've\ngot to pull into the school setting."},"980":{"dur":5,"text":"Businesses, foundations around the country,\nthey want to fund more CareerConnect programs"},"986":{"dur":2,"text":"-- because it's in their interest."},"989":{"dur":2,"text":"They want good employees."},"991":{"dur":2,"text":"They're looking for folks with skills."},"994":{"dur":4,"text":"When you can say, hey, the math that I'm doing\nhere could change the way the business operates;"},"998":{"dur":4,"text":"or, I see how this biology experiment could\nhelp develop a drug that cures a disease -- that's"},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"a door opening in your imagination."},"1005":{"dur":1,"text":"It's also good for our economy."},"1006":{"dur":3,"text":"It's good for our businesses."},"1010":{"dur":5,"text":"That's a new career path you're thinking about\nthat allows you to pursue higher education"},"1015":{"dur":5,"text":"in that field, or the very training you need\nto get a good job, or create a new business"},"1020":{"dur":1,"text":"that changes the

just"},"1040":{"dur":4,"text":"studying because your parents tell you to\nor your teacher tells you to, you're studying"},"1044":{"dur":2,"text":"because you know you've got something to
