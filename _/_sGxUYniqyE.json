ask"},"22":{"dur":5,"text":"is, so you were the\nfounder, this was your baby,"},"27":{"dur":3,"text":"Nasty Gal was your\ncompany for years,"},"31":{"dur":3,"text":"how did the idea of\nwriting a book come about?"},"34":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, was that\nsomething you've always"},"36":{"dur":4,"text":"wanted to do, is that something\nsomebody else had the idea for?"},"46":{"dur":0,"text":"SOPHIA AMORUSO: Hi."},"47":{"dur":1,"text":"OK."},"48":{"dur":1,"text":"OK."},"50":{"dur":4,"text":"Let's see, so part of\nmy stories has a lot"},"54":{"dur":1,"text":"to do with social media,\na lot of my stories"},"56":{"dur":1,"text":"have a lot to do\nwith social media."},"57":{"dur":3,"text":"And on my personal social media,\nwhich I didn't really have,"},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"at least publicly, until\nInstagram really came around,"},"64":{"dur":3,"text":"I was getting a lot of\ncomments that were like,"},"68":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to do what you did,\nI want to work for you,"},"70":{"dur":0,"text":"how did you do it?"},"71":{"dur":4,"text":"Like I have an\neBay store, I want"},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"to learn from what\nyou've done, whatever."},"78":{"dur":4,"text":"And so everything I've done\nwith Nasty Gal, social media,"},"82":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of it is about listening,\nand it was very serendipitous."},"86":{"dur":3,"text":"So I moved to LA, I bought\na house, so it was cool,"},"90":{"dur":1,"text":"and I needed an attorney."},"92":{"dur":1,"text":"And the only attorney\nI'd really had"},"93":{"dur":3,"text":"was someone who worked\non my will, which"},"97":{"dur":3,"text":"is a kind of depressing\nthing to do in your 20s."},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I needed someone that\nwas like a general attorney that"},"103":{"dur":3,"text":"could deal with contractors,\nand an architect, or whatever."},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"I was going to\nremodel this place."},"108":{"dur":1,"text":"And I got introduced\nto someone who"},"110":{"dur":1,"text":"was like, I didn't\nknow at the time,"},"112":{"dur":2,"text":"they were an\nentertainment attorney."},"115":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I had a\nmeeting with him, he"},"116":{"dur":1,"text":"was like, listen I can\ndeal with contracts"},"118":{"dur":2,"text":"for like, your\nwhatever, plumber,"},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"but what else do you want to do?"},"123":{"dur":1,"text":"Like do you want\na TV show, do you"},"125":{"dur":1,"text":"want-- what do you want to do?"},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"Nasty Gal's amazing, you\ncould do so much with this,"},"129":{"dur":3,"text":"and I was like, I don't know,\na book seems really cool,"},"133":{"dur":1,"text":"but I don't know."},"135":{"dur":1,"text":"And then he said, cool\nI'll introduce you"},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"to the head of the\nliterary department at WME,"},"139":{"dur":1,"text":"I can't make anything\nhappen for you,"},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"but all I can do is\nmake the introduction"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"and if something\nhappens then great."},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"And he did, and I had\na meeting with someone"},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"who works for her, who is\nnow kind of like my fairy"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"godmother at WME."},"155":{"dur":1,"text":"And we had one\nmeeting and she said,"},"156":{"dur":1,"text":"what would you want to do?"},"158":{"dur":3,"text":"The obvious thing would be to\ndo a style book, a hardcover"},"161":{"dur":1,"text":"coffee table book."},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was like, I don't know,\nI mean that's so expected."},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's not because I wanted\nto do something unexpected,"},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"it's just because a business\nbook would be really fun."},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's a lot\nof stories that I"},"175":{"dur":3,"text":"hadn't told about my experience\nto reporters in the media,"},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"because what am I going\nto do, tell Forbes"},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"that I was a dumpster diver?"},"182":{"dur":1,"text":"Like what's the\nheadline going to be?"},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"So it was cool to\ntell my own story"},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"and also I really\nkind of set out"},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"to write a book that\nwas, in some way,"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"like the gateway\ndrug to the business"},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"section of the\nbookstore, for someone"},"197":{"dur":5,"text":"who may not be going there\nyet, because I was that girl."},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think there's\na lot to learn"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"in that part of the bookstore."},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: So\nthat's interesting"},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"that you say that that's\nsort of the gateway drug"},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"to like a book about\nbusiness or management,"},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"because when you\nsee the cover it"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"doesn't look like a book\nabout business, right?"},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"It's \"#Girlboss,\" I mean, yeah,\nit has the word boss in it,"},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"but what made you\npick that title,"},"221":{"dur":1,"text":"at what point did\nyou pick that title,"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"what does it mean\nfor you, and also,"},"225":{"dur":4,"text":"how would you differentiate\na #Girlboss from a Nasty Gal."},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"Like if both have a\npersona, are they the same"},"231":{"dur":0,"text":"or are they different?"},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"SOPHIA AMORUSO: Good questions."},"235":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I named Nasty Gal\nafter an album and a song"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"by a lady named\nBette Davis, and I"},"242":{"dur":3,"text":"don't know, just\nin that same vein,"},"245":{"dur":1,"text":"really I'm not inventing names."},"247":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's a film, a\nvery little known film,"},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"called \"Girl Boss Guerrilla\"\nfrom the '70s that's"},"253":{"dur":4,"text":"like a Japanese\nfemale revenge flick,"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's really\nstylish, really good."},"261":{"dur":4,"text":"It's like girl gangs knife\nfighting in the streets."},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just so cool, and they\nhave a tattoo over their,"},"267":{"dur":3,"text":"like, right boob or something."},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's called \"Girl\nBoss Guerrilla,\""},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"and I just loved the name, and\nI was just like, \"#Girlboss.\""},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know, it was never\ncalled anything else,"},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"there were no alternate\nnames, it was just kind of"},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"really simple."},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"And then how do you\ndifferentiate a Girl Boss"},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"from a Nast Gal?"},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"I think Nasty Gal\ndresses girls to feel"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"like they can live the\nlife that they want"},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"and achieve what they want,\nand Girl Boss gives them,"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"hopefully, the tools to do it."},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"So I would say, the\nethos is very similar."},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"Nasty Gal is a fashion\nbrand, first and foremost,"},"307":{"dur":5,"text":"and I think Girl Boss right now\nis a book, [AUDIO OUT] cast."},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"This isn't working,\ndo you wanna switch?"},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER:Yeah,\nlet's switch."},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"SOPHIA AMORUSO: Hello."},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"But I think Girl Boss has the\npotential to be a lot more."},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: You have a\nfoundation now and everything,"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's hear a little\nmore about that."},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"SOPHIA AMORUSO: Yeah, so\nwe launched the Girl Boss"},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"foundation about a year ago,\nand I just really wanted"},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"to do something to give back\nto girls who were starting"},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"their own businesses,\nand specifically"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"creative entrepreneurs,\nI think, because it"},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"was my experience\nwith photography that"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"got me kind of like,\noh that was really"},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"fun about having an online\nshop was the photography."},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"And it still is today,\neven though I'm not"},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"taking the pictures."},"357":{"dur":5,"text":"So to date we've given\naway $75,000 in grants"},"363":{"dur":4,"text":"to girls in like art,\nmusic, fashion, design."},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"One girl makes these really\nbeautiful silk scarves,"},"370":{"dur":4,"text":"and used the grant to like\nrent some space in a showroom"},"375":{"dur":3,"text":"and to make samples\nof silk pajamas using"},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"the same kind of\nillustrations that she"},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"prints onto her\nscarves, and they're"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"really, really beautiful."},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"There's another grant recipient\nwho publishes novellas, so"},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"short-form books."},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"Her company is called Novella\nand she's really awesome."},"393":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's the start\nto something that I"},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"think will become a bigger\nway that Girl Boss can tell"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"other people's stories\nother than my own,"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"because I think even\nhearing their stories"},"405":{"dur":3,"text":"gives other people\nperspective and confidence."},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: I mean I\nthink that's the biggest"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"appeal of your book,\nand it was for me."},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"It certainly was\nvery inspiring for me"},"416":{"dur":4,"text":"when I read the hardback\nmaybe a year ago."},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think what's\ninteresting is"},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"the whole trajectory from\nquote unquote \"dumpster"},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"diving free-gan,\"\nsort of interested"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"in anarchy and sort of\ngoing from job to job,"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"and then bam you're\na CEO and you"},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"have this multimillion\ndollar company,"},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're this\nbig success story."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"And everybody thinks it's\nan overnight success,"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"but that journey was definitely\nnot an immediate one."},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"SOPHIA AMORUSO: It's been\nalmost nine years since I"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"started selling stuff on eBay."},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: And so,\nwhat I'm curious about"},"450":{"dur":5,"text":"is, was there a\nmoment that showed"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"you, that demonstrated that,\nyou had sort of, quote unquote,"},"458":{"dur":0,"text":"\"made it.\""},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"Was there a moment\nwhere you were like,"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"wow this is much bigger than\nI ever thought it would be."},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"SOPHIA AMORUSO:\nYeah, absolutely."},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't ever use the\nterm, I've made it,"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"and I get that a lot like,\nwhen did you made it?"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"Making it, I think, is just,\nlike that's an everyday thing,"},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"because if I thought\nI'd made it I'd probably"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"look like the wrong way and\nget hit by a bus or something,"},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"be like, woo-whoo, phew."},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"You know like, don't turn\nyour back to the ocean."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"But there was a\ntime, and there's"},"489":{"dur":4,"text":"different moments over\nthe course of Nasty Gal's"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"trajectory, I think,\nthat were symbols"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"of that and other symbols of\nlike, holy shit this could all"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"fall apart, you know?"},"503":{"dur":4,"text":"But I think the first one was\nwhen I was in LA, like shopping"},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"for vintage and\nvisiting friends,"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"drinking canned beer\nin someones backyard,"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"and my auctions were closing,\nwhich is just so cool."},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"You get all these\ne-mails and the auctions"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"go crazy at the last\nminute, because people think"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"they're going to like sneak\nin and get a great deal,"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"but they actually just drive\nprices up because all it takes"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"is two people that are\nwilling to spend $100 more."},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"And you're like,\nwhoa like it went up"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"$100 in the last three seconds."},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I think it was\nprobably 2007--"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean it was only on eBay\nfor like a year and a half--"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"that my auctions were\nclosing and it was one week's"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"worth of auctions and\nit was like $2,500"},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"of stuff, which I probably paid\nlike, who knows in total, $100"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"Who knows what my\ntotal cost was."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"But it was just like, wow I'm\ndrinking a beer with friends"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"and I just made $2,500."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't even know if I'd ever\nmade that in a month at a job"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"at that point in my life,\nso that was pretty exciting."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: It's almost like\nit's so surreal because it's"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"an ordinary moment where\nyou're drinking beer,"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"instead of this\nbig glitzy moment."},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"SOPHIA AMORUSO: Yeah, I mean\nso many exciting moments"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"happen on our\nphones now, I guess,"},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"and that was the case for me."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: So tell us\nmore about your current role."},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"So you were the CEO, now you\nare the executive chairman."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"You are, of course,\nalways the founder"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"and you carry and embody\nso much of the brand"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"to so many people\nwho admire the brand,"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"but what's your current role?"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"How has that evolved\nand do you still"},"600":{"dur":3,"text":"have as much\ncreative input as you"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"did in the choices and the\ndirection the brand is moving?"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"SOPHIA AMORUSO: Yeah."},"607":{"dur":4,"text":"So you know, when you found a\ncompany, you're also the CEO."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean I was a CEO of a one\nperson company at one point,"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"I was also, as soon as we\nincorporated on LegalZoom,"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"I guess I was the executive\nchair or the president,"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"and the secretary, and\nall of those things."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"And, you know, CEO\nwas never a title"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"that I was like, I'm going\nto start an eBay store,"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"I can't wait to\nhave the CEO title"},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"and have people call me that."},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"It just doesn't really matter\nto me because what I've built"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"is what matters."},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"What I get to do\neveryday matters."},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"So I've always been\nthe executive chairman,"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm still the\nexecutive chairman."},"643":{"dur":0,"text":"What does that mean?"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean I own most\nof the company,"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"technically I\ncontrol the company,"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"and I have as much\ncreative input as I want."},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"One thing we're spending\na lot of time on right"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"now is creating tools\nfor our creative team,"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"for anyone that\ntouches the brand"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"to understand what the brand is,\nto know how to use the brand,"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"what the parameters\nare, where you can play."},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"But over the course\nof the last--"},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean since I've had a team\nthat are making decisions"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"on Nasty Gal's behalf, whether\nit's writing email copy,"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"social media copy, taking\na photo for social media,"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"or taking a photo that's\ngoing to go on the home page,"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"all of those things have to\ngo through some sort of brand"},"682":{"dur":4,"text":"And when all you have is\nconversations about that, one,"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"you find yourself having\nthe same conversation"},"688":{"dur":4,"text":"over and over, and two, it\nfeels like a personal thing,"},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"so it feels like my opinion\nversus your opinion,"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"or someone's opinion versus\nsomeone else's opinion"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"about what's right\nfor the brand,"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"rather than this is what\nit is, it lives here,"},"704":{"dur":4,"text":"let me self-reflect before\nanyone-- a tool basically."},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"So it makes things\nmore objective,"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's something we're\ndoing a lot of work on,"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"is getting this kind\nof like brand bible,"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"I guess, to get out of my head\nthe things that make Nasty"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"Gal tick, so that other\npeople can do a great job"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"and aren't getting emails from\nme at midnight being like,"},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"what is this insane copy,\nlike what does this even mean?"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't send emails that\nsound exactly like that,"},"732":{"dur":6,"text":"but you know, there's a lot of,\nwhen a company becomes sizable,"},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"and the brand-- you know, I\nthink if our brand was more"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"focused, if we had a singular\nproduct, if we were Blue Bottle"},"745":{"dur":5,"text":"Coffee, keeping the brand\nin line would be simpler."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not saying it's easy,\nor it's easy for them."},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"We have so many products that\nwe write so much copy for,"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"we take so many pictures and\nsend out so many e-mail blasts,"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"and post on social media\nso often that it's almost"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"like the volume is\nhard, but also Nasty Gal"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"has a very specific\nvoice, which isn't"},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"as easy to nail as the voice\nof maybe some other brands."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you feel like\nthere have ever been moments"},"774":{"dur":5,"text":"where you felt pressured?"},"779":{"dur":0,"text":"It's not working."},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"SOPHIA AMORUSO:\nHere, let's just--"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: Hello."},"784":{"dur":0,"text":"Hello."},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you feel like they\nhave ever been moments"},"787":{"dur":7,"text":"where you felt that there was\nsome pressure on Nasty Gal"},"794":{"dur":4,"text":"to conform to whatever was the\nsexiest sort of mass market"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"trend at the time and then\nyou might have-- have there"},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"been any moments where you took\na direction that didn't fit"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"feel like it was faithful\nto the actual brand?"},"808":{"dur":5,"text":"SOPHIA AMORUSO: Yes, but\nI would say our intent"},"813":{"dur":6,"text":"and the execution-- so in\nintent, no in execution, yes."},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"So when there's a lot of\ndifferent people fulfilling"},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"the task at hand-- we have\nsomething internally that we"},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"call \"fuxury,\" which is kind of\nlike the word fuck and luxury"},"830":{"dur":5,"text":"together, and it's almost like\nanother word for aspirational"},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"or any word you could\nthink of, but it's"},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of like our\nproduct architecture,"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"we just use it to refer\nto something internally."},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"But, because it sounds like\nluxury, at a certain point--"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"and we had a fair\namount of turnover"},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"in this period in\nmerchandising, so there's that."},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's the\npeople that did know,"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's the people who\nare new and still trying"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"to figure it out, and\nyou never really know"},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"who placed the order\nfor whatever it is."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"But the last year\nor so there's been"},"861":{"dur":4,"text":"a fair amount of\npricey stuff coming"},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"through, beautiful\nstuff, but I think,"},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"we want to have quality product,\nand to really stand behind"},"872":{"dur":4,"text":"that, our price should migrate\na teeny bit, like a little bit,"},"877":{"dur":4,"text":"but I think it migrated faster\nthan we had anticipated."},"881":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's something that takes,\nI mean, the lead time's long,"},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"reacting takes time, and\nthat affects your business."},"888":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's definitely-- I\ndon't want to turn off the girl"},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"who's looking for\na $58-$68 dress,"},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"we have to have\nsomething for her."},"898":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's been\nmoments in the last year"},"899":{"dur":4,"text":"that it looks like we're over\nher or something, which is not"},"904":{"dur":1,"text":"the case, you know?"},"908":{"dur":4,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: So let's take\nit back to the earlier days,"},"913":{"dur":1,"text":"around the time you\nstarted the eBay store."},"915":{"dur":4,"text":"Right before that,\nyou had a lot of jobs"},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"and you detail\nthose in the book."},"922":{"dur":4,"text":"You worked at the art\nschool checking IDs,"},"927":{"dur":4,"text":"and you worked at Subway, and\nall these different things,"},"931":{"dur":4,"text":"and then Nasty Gal\nhappened, and it stuck."},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"So one thing I am\ncurious about is, do you"},"939":{"dur":4,"text":"have sort of like\na system, a way"},"943":{"dur":5,"text":"that you know now, after having\nbeen through all those choices,"},"949":{"dur":4,"text":"of knowing when to quit and\nwhen to keep grinding or keep"},"954":{"dur":1,"text":"hustling?"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"How do you make that\ndecision about anything"},"958":{"dur":3,"text":"big about Nasty\nGal or otherwise?"},"962":{"dur":3,"text":"SOPHIA AMORUSO: It's tough\nbecause I worked really hard,"},"965":{"dur":4,"text":"but a lot of what's worked\nfor me has also been somewhat"},"970":{"dur":2,"text":"of a path-of-least-resistance\nmodel,"},"972":{"dur":5,"text":"and that can work when you're\ndoing everything or when"},"978":{"dur":2,"text":"you're young, when
