CUNY system,"},"1567":{"dur":2,"text":"including all four-year and\ntwo-year colleges, combined."},"1570":{"dur":2,"text":"And you see a very different distribution,"},"1572":{"dur":2,"text":"you

know,"},"1593":{"dur":2,"text":"in order to create mobility,\nyou have to give access"},"1595":{"dur":3,"text":"to children from relatively\nlow-income families."},"1599":{"dur":2,"text":"And so CUNY, you can see,\nis clearly doing that."},"1601":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the next step, in\nterms of creating mobility,"},"1604":{"dur":2,"text":"is that you also have\nto deliver good outcomes"},"1606":{"dur":2,"text":"for students in adulthood, right?"},"1609":{"dur":1,"text":"And so let's now examine\nstudents' earnings,"},"1611":{"dur":3,"text":"measuring kids' earnings when\nthey're in their mid-30s."},"1615":{"dur":3,"text":"Which is what we're able to do\nin currently-available data."},"1618":{"dur":2,"text":"And the way we're gonna\nlook at this data is ask:"},"1620":{"dur":3,"text":"what fraction of students from families"},"1623":{"dur":2,"text":"in the bottom fifth of\nthe distribution make it"},"1626":{"dur":2,"text":"to the top fifth of the distribution?"},"1628":{"dur":1,"text":"So there are many different ways"},"1630":{"dur":1,"text":"in which you can define mobility."},"1631":{"dur":2,"text":"They tend to give you similar

what does that look\nlike, again, at CUNY?"},"1643":{"dur":2,"text":"And here I'm gonna focus on\none particular CUNY college,"},"1645":{"dur":3,"text":"Hunter College, and so here,\nfirst, just showing you"},"1648":{"dur":4,"text":"the bars representing\naccess as a reference."},"1653":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can see at Hunter\nCollege, 21 percent of students"},"1656":{"dur":2,"text":"come from the bottom\nquintile of the distribution."},"1658":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's now ask: what fraction\nof those low-income kids"},"1662":{"dur":2,"text":"end up making it to the top 20 percent"},"1665":{"dur":1,"text":"of the national income distribution?"},"1667":{"dur":2,"text":"That is: when they're around 30 years old,"},"1669":{"dur":2,"text":"earning more than $60,000 a year."},"1672":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can see that, at Hunter College,"},"1674":{"dur":4,"text":"about 36 percent of kids end\nup making it to the top fifth."},"1678":{"dur":3,"text":"Conditional on starting in a\nfamily on the bottom fifth."},"1682":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, an interesting pattern,\nwhich turns out to be true"},"1684":{"dur":3,"text":"not just at CUNY, but at\nall colleges we look at,"},"1687":{"dur":3,"text":"is that kids' outcomes\ndon't vary very much"},"1690":{"dur":2,"text":"with respect to their parents' income,"},"1693":{"dur":2,"text":"conditional on the college they attend."},"1695":{"dur":2,"text":"So that is to say, kids\nfrom high-income families"},"1698":{"dur":1,"text":"and kids from low-income families"},"1700":{"dur":2,"text":"do just about as well\nas each other at CUNY"},"1702":{"dur":2,"text":"and at most other colleges\nin the United States."},"1705":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that, I think,\nis quite encouraging,"},"1707":{"dur":1,"text":"because it shows that\nCUNY is quite effective"},"1709":{"dur":2,"text":"in leveling the playing field between kids"},"1712":{"dur":1,"text":"from high-income and low-income families."},"1713":{"dur":3,"text":"Kids from low-income families\nappear to be able to overcome"},"1717":{"dur":2,"text":"the disadvantages they\nmay have had in childhood"},"1719":{"dur":3,"text":"and have similar rates of success."},"1722":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I want to do next\nis put together the measure"},"1726":{"dur":3,"text":"of access, the number of\nlow-income kids at each college,"},"1730":{"dur":1,"text":"with these measures of success rates,"},"1731":{"dur":1,"text":"how well those kids are doing,"},"1733":{"dur":2,"text":"to construct what I'll\ncall a \"mobility rate\"."},"1736":{"dur":3,"text":"That is, what fraction of\nstudents at a given college"},"1740":{"dur":2,"text":"start poor, that is come from a family"},"1742":{"dur":2,"text":"in the bottom fifth of the distribution,"},"1744":{"dur":2,"text":"and end up well-off,\nthat is end up in the top"},"1747":{"dur":2,"text":"20 percent of the income distribution."},"1750":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, that mobility rate can be computed"},"1753":{"dur":3,"text":"as just access times the success rate."},"1756":{"dur":2,"text":"So to take an example, at Hunter College,"},"1758":{"dur":2,"text":"we saw that access was 21 percent."},"1760":{"dur":2,"text":"21 percent of kids came\nfrom poor families."},"1763":{"dur":4,"text":"And 36 percent of those kids\nmade it to the top 20 percent."},"1768":{"dur":2,"text":"So that means that the mobility rate at"},"1770":{"dur":2,"text":"Hunter College is seven\nand a half percent."},"1772":{"dur":1,"text":"The way to interpret that number is"},"1774":{"dur":2,"text":"that out of 100 students\nat Hunter College,"},"1777":{"dur":3,"text":"seven and a half started\npoor and ended up rich, okay?"},"1781":{"dur":2,"text":"So now let's, as a frame of reference,"},"1783":{"dur":2,"text":"now let's compare that to\nall of the other colleges"},"1786":{"dur":2,"text":"in the US, and I'm gonna show the data"},"1788":{"dur":3,"text":"for all the colleges in the\nUS, using this plot here."},"1792":{"dur":3,"text":"So, on the vertical axis\nis the success rate,"},"1796":{"dur":2,"text":"how well kids do, conditional on starting"},"1798":{"dur":3,"text":"in a low income family, and\nthe horizontal axis is access."},"1802":{"dur":2,"text":"So again, just to remind\nyou, at Hunter college,"},"1805":{"dur":4,"text":"access is 21 percent, the\nsuccess rate is 36 percent."},"1809":{"dur":4,"text":"So now let's bring in all\nof the other CUNY campuses,"},"1813":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can see that there's\nthis cloud of points,"},"1816":{"dur":2,"text":"all with relatively high levels of access,"},"1818":{"dur":3,"text":"and fairly high success rates."},"1822":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can see variation between"},"1823":{"dur":1,"text":"these colleges, as you might expect."},"1825":{"dur":2,"text":"So for example, the two-year\ncolleges like Queensborough"},"1827":{"dur":3,"text":"and Kingsborough tend to\nhave higher levels of access,"},"1830":{"dur":3,"text":"but lower levels of\nsuccess rates, alright?"},"1834":{"dur":2,"text":"So now, as a comparison,\nlet's now contrast this"},"1836":{"dur":3,"text":"with all the other\ncolleges in New York City."},"1840":{"dur":3,"text":"And you see that the\nCUNY colleges tend to be"},"1843":{"dur":2,"text":"in the upper-right portion\nof this chart, right?"},"1846":{"dur":2,"text":"They tend to have relatively high access"},"1848":{"dur":2,"text":"and relatively high success rates,"},"1851":{"dur":2,"text":"which is what contributes\nto high mobility rates,"},"1854":{"dur":2,"text":"relative to other colleges in New York."},"1856":{"dur":2,"text":"So the average mobility rate"},"1858":{"dur":2,"text":"for the CUNY system is 7.2 percent."},"1861":{"dur":2,"text":"That's more than twice\nas large as the average"},"1863":{"dur":3,"text":"mobility rate for all the\nother New York City colleges."},"1867":{"dur":2,"text":"And so if, you know, why\nis that you have some"},"1869":{"dur":2,"text":"colleges like Columbia and Princeton"},"1872":{"dur":2,"text":"that have terrific\noutcomes, the best outcomes,"},"1874":{"dur":1,"text":"essentially, of any college in the US,"},"1876":{"dur":2,"text":"perhaps not surprisingly, but they admit"},"1878":{"dur":2,"text":"such a small fraction of low-income kids"},"1881":{"dur":2,"text":"that they move very few low-income kids"},"1883":{"dur":2,"text":"to the upper part of\nthe income distribution."},"1885":{"dur":1,"text":"At the other end of the spectrum,"},"1887":{"dur":1,"text":"you have certain community\ncolleges in New York"},"1889":{"dur":1,"text":"that have lots of low-income kids,"},"1891":{"dur":1,"text":"but don't have very high success rates."},"1892":{"dur":1,"text":"And as a result, they also don't"},"1894":{"dur":1,"text":"have very high mobility rates."},"1896":{"dur":2,"text":"So CUNY has that relatively\nunique combination"},"1898":{"dur":2,"text":"of admitting lots of low-income kids"},"1900":{"dur":2,"text":"and having quite good outcomes."},"1903":{"dur":2,"text":"And then finally, we can bring\nin all the other colleges"},"1905":{"dur":2,"text":"in the United States, represented\nby the gray dots here,"},"1908":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can, again, see\nhow much of an outlier"},"1911":{"dur":3,"text":"the CUNY system really is,\nrelative to the entire spectrum"},"1914":{"dur":2,"text":"of colleges in the US."},"1916":{"dur":3,"text":"So, to summarize that data, we can look"},"1919":{"dur":3,"text":"at the top 10 colleges in\nAmerica by these mobility rates,"},"1923":{"dur":2,"text":"and this is the statistic\nthat Mike Bloomberg"},"1926":{"dur":2,"text":"was referring to, you see that this list"},"1928":{"dur":2,"text":"of top 10 colleges

there's a lot of value\nadded from attending CUNY"},"2648":{"dur":3,"text":"because of the particular\ninstruction that it offers."},"2651":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, piecing apart those\nexplanations is what"},"2653":{"dur":2,"text":"we hope to do, going forward."},"2656":{"dur":1,"text":"One thing I will note,\nwhich makes me think"},"2658":{"dur":2,"text":"that there is a lot of value added
