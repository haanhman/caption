everything."},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"So why is International Women's Day still\nimportant?"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"Why do we have to keep having this conversation?"},"366":{"dur":7,"text":"And I'm just gonna refer to some images that\nI'm carrying with me from some of the things"},"373":{"dur":4,"text":"that I've been doing in the last little while,\nand I'm going to start with some images from"},"378":{"dur":4,"text":"my trip to India, the trade mission to India."},"382":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was a wonderful opportunity."},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"We brought back agreements."},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"We made connections in India."},"391":{"dur":6,"text":"And there's so much happening in India that\nis an opportunity for people who in India"},"398":{"dur":9,"text":"are living in poverty, who have a Prime Minister\nnow who really wants to find ways to change"},"407":{"dur":4,"text":"the economy so that it benefits a much broader\nswathe of the population."},"411":{"dur":7,"text":"KW: But there's an enormous amount to do,\nand the task is almost overwhelming to an"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"outside observer."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"So a couple of the images that I am carrying\nwith me."},"424":{"dur":8,"text":"The first one is women sitting on the medians\nand the sides of the roads nursing their children,"},"433":{"dur":6,"text":"cooking on an open flame, living sitting under\ntarps."},"440":{"dur":4,"text":"And these are people who don't even have the\nbenefit of living in one of the slums where"},"444":{"dur":5,"text":"there actually are four walls and a ceiling."},"450":{"dur":4,"text":"But they're actually living in the open air."},"455":{"dur":5,"text":"And then the second image is of those women\nin the slums."},"461":{"dur":6,"text":"And I'm saying the women because it was the\nwomen and the children who I saw the most"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"of in those situations."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the group of people that I saw."},"471":{"dur":8,"text":"KW: And so we visited a slum in New Delhi\nand I had the opportunity to meet with an"},"480":{"dur":5,"text":"NGO who was working with, this group was working\nwith women in this community."},"486":{"dur":4,"text":"And what they had done was they had brought\nthe women together."},"490":{"dur":4,"text":"Women who had been living very close to one\nanother, but hadn't had the opportunity to"},"494":{"dur":4,"text":"come together, hadn't had the resources to\nactually begin to solve problems together."},"499":{"dur":5,"text":"And what this project, called Asha, did was\nit brought women together."},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"They started to solve problems."},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"They put in place some supports for the kids\nto be studying."},"510":{"dur":4,"text":"There were kids from the community now going,\nthere are kids now going to college, going"},"515":{"dur":5,"text":"on to university, because their mothers had\nhad the opportunity to work together, with"},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"some support, and start to solve some problems."},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's another image."},"525":{"dur":7,"text":"KW: And then the third one from my trip was\na group of politicians, one from Nepal, one"},"533":{"dur":7,"text":"from India, one from Pakistan, one from Sri\nLanka, and one from Afghanistan, and me talking"},"540":{"dur":6,"text":"about women in politics and women in leadership\nand how we can encourage more young women"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"to be involved, how we can encourage women\nto be involved."},"549":{"dur":5,"text":"And what was interesting about that conversation\nwas that although we come from such radically"},"555":{"dur":4,"text":"different places, many of the themes were\nthe same."},"559":{"dur":8,"text":"They were the same themes about the burden\nof work and how to balance a family and a"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"schedule that a politician would have."},"570":{"dur":7,"text":"How to find, how to get access to the money\nthat was needed to launch a political career?"},"577":{"dur":7,"text":"And then how to, once in the political culture,\nto raise their voices, raise our voices, to"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"the point where we could have an impact?"},"586":{"dur":6,"text":"KW: So those were some of the conversations\nthat I had when I was in India."},"592":{"dur":7,"text":"And so all of that just reinforces for me\nthat this is such an important conversation."},"600":{"dur":4,"text":"It's an important conversation in Ontario,\nCanada and I will come to that, but it's an"},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"important conversation outside of our borders\nas well."},"608":{"dur":7,"text":"And so I think that we are privileged here\nto have the opportunity to have this conversation"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"in the way that we can."},"618":{"dur":8,"text":"So right now I am serving in a government\nwhere there is more than 30% representation"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"of women in the legislature."},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"30% is a bit of a magic number."},"631":{"dur":4,"text":"Whether it's a cooperation or whether it's\na political entity once you get to 30% what"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"the research shows is that there's a different\nconversation at the table."},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"KW: And why is that important?"},"641":{"dur":5,"text":"That's important because if 50% of the population\nis not represented at the table then that's"},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"a real challenge."},"648":{"dur":7,"text":"And so what we know is that when we have 30%\nrepresentation at those tables, at those decision"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"making tables, then different issues are talked\nabout."},"659":{"dur":5,"text":"So for example, and I wish Pauline were still\nhere, because what I would say to her is the"},"664":{"dur":9,"text":"fact that at our caucus and cabinet table\nwe had a conversation about the salaries and"},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"wages of different groups in our society."},"677":{"dur":4,"text":"And two years ago when we looked at the trajectory\nof certain groups, certain professional groups"},"682":{"dur":7,"text":"in Ontario, we saw that there were some groups\nthat were going straight up that they had"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"for a number of years had very regular increases."},"692":{"dur":5,"text":"KW: And then there was a group that was right\nat the bottom of that grid, and were not getting"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"increases."},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"And those were personal support workers, they\nwere developmental support workers, and they"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"were early childhood educators."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"Those lines were going flat along the bottom\nof the graph."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we made a decision."},"709":{"dur":8,"text":"The Finance Minister, the Treasury Board President,\nand I and our caucus and cabinet made a decision"},"717":{"dur":5,"text":"that we were going to invest specifically\nin those people."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"Those people who delivered those services."},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"Most of whom are women."},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"And we were going to put a direct increase\ninto those salaries because it wasn't happening"},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"naturally, for whatever reason."},"733":{"dur":5,"text":"Their voices in their unions, in their federations,\nin their workplaces were not carrying and"},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"they were not getting the increases that other,\nother groups were."},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"KW: So we made a direct, we made a direct\nincrease on those salaries."},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"That would not have happened."},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"It would not have happened."},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"And I've had members of my caucus and cabinet\nsay it would not have happened if we hadn't"},"754":{"dur":6,"text":"had a critical mass of women who said, \"This\nwork is not being recognized and we have to"},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"do something about that.\""},"761":{"dur":5,"text":"KW: So that's the kind of decision, like the\ndecision that we made to put a new policy"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"in place in terms of sexual assault and violence."},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"The, It's Never Okay Policy."},"772":{"dur":5,"text":"The ad campaign, the changes we're making\nin legislation in terms of victim services"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"and supports within the justice system."},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"That would not have happened if we hadn't\nhad a big enough group of women who said,"},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"\"This is important, we have to pay attention\nto this.\""},"787":{"dur":6,"text":"KW: So, that is why it is important that we\ncontinue to have this conversation."},"794":{"dur":5,"text":"It's why it's important that we have made,\nwe've put a policy in place in terms of comply"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"or explain."},"800":{"dur":4,"text":"In terms of corporate boards having more women,\nmore representation."},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll tell you that that's not working."},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"From my perspective it's not working."},"810":{"dur":6,"text":"I think it's 15% of boards or something has\nactually increased the number of women and"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"is even approaching 30%."},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we're gonna have to do something more\nabout that."},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"And in fact, the group Catalyst is going to\nbring us a report where they're going to be"},"825":{"dur":5,"text":"giving us some advice on what more we can\ndo in terms of getting more representation"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"on board."},"832":{"dur":4,"text":"So we try the nudge and the encouragement."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"If that doesn't work then we bring out the\nhammer."},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"What can I say."},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"To make a difference."},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"KW: I think that there are a number of other\nissues."},"845":{"dur":1,"text":"There's the wage gap."},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"We've got a working group right now."},"849":{"dur":1,"text":"We're tackling the wage gap."},"850":{"dur":4,"text":"I can't tell you exactly what we're going\nto do about it, but it exists, it's real."},"855":{"dur":6,"text":"As our Minister of Labor said, \"Whether it's\n12% or 35%, whatever it is, no number's a"},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"good number.\""},"863":{"dur":6,"text":"And so we need to figure out how we can once\nagain begin to tackle that wage gap."},"869":{"dur":8,"text":"KW: And then I guess I would just say finally\nthat we're having another theoretical conversation"},"878":{"dur":5,"text":"in our society and the society to the south\nof the border."},"883":{"dur":6,"text":"About who's a feminist and who's not a feminist\nand who should be voting for whom."},"890":{"dur":7,"text":"I think that one of the things that is very\ndangerous is if we let those labels and that"},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of a debate pull us apart."},"900":{"dur":5,"text":"As I've said to folks over the last few days,\nI'm 62 years old, I've been having this discussion"},"905":{"dur":2,"text":"with my mother for 60 years."},"907":{"dur":1,"text":"She doesn't want to call herself a feminist."},"909":{"dur":1,"text":"I always called myself a feminist."},"911":{"dur":1,"text":"Whatever."},"912":{"dur":7,"text":"[chuckle] The point is, what are we doing\nto make sure that every child in this province,"},"919":{"dur":7,"text":"male, female whatever background children\ncome from, that they see the opportunities."},"927":{"dur":5,"text":"That the see no limit to their opportunities,\nthat they see the possibilities, and they"},"933":{"dur":5,"text":"feel free and unconstrained to follow whatever\ntheir dream may be."},"938":{"dur":2,"text":"KW: That for me is the point."},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's the place that we're not at yet."},"943":{"dur":1,"text":"But that's our goal."},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"That has to be our objective to get there."},"946":{"dur":5,"text":"And so when people come up to me and say,\n\"What's it like to be the first female premiere"},"951":{"dur":1,"text":"in the province?\""},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"And I've said this to many people, you may\nhave heard me say it before."},"955":{"dur":2,"text":"What's it like to be the first female premiere\nin the province?"},"957":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't know what it's like to be a male premiere,\nso I can't answer that question."},"961":{"dur":3,"text":"I have no way of comparing what it's like."},"964":{"dur":1,"text":"[applause]"},"965":{"dur":8,"text":"KW: So all I know is, that if there are young\npeople who see me in this role and that helps"},"973":{"dur":4,"text":"them to imagine themselves in a leadership\nrole, that's great."},"978":{"dur":1,"text":"That is a very good thing."},"979":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I try whenever I can to encourage young\npeople."},"984":{"dur":1,"text":"And mentoring is very, very important."},"986":{"dur":6,"text":"It's a very important part of what we all\ndo as we get into our lives."},"993":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm gonna continue to do that."},"994":{"dur":6,"text":"And I appreciate all of you who are interested\nin having this debate."},"1000":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a very important one."},"1002":{"dur":4,"text":"I think that one of the things that we're\nseeing in the United States is this, and I"},"1007":{"dur":1,"text":"keep."},"1008":{"dur":3,"text":"I've heard myself say this to myself a number\nof times over the years, but I hope I'm saying"},"1011":{"dur":1,"text":"it now and it's true."},"1013":{"dur":10,"text":"The last gasp of some of this really vile\nsort of misogyny and division."},"1024":{"dur":2,"text":"I hope that's it's the last gasp."},"1026":{"dur":3,"text":"I, maybe it's not but we can talk about that."},"1029":{"dur":7,"text":"But it's really important that we, here, do\neverything we can to create that equitable"},"1037":{"dur":3,"text":"society that we've been talking about for\nso long."},"1041":{"dur":5,"text":"KW: So I'm just going to quote Canadian hero\nof mine, Nellie McClung, she said, \"The women"},"1047":{"dur":5,"text":"who have achieved success in the various fields\nof labor, have won the victory for us."},"1052":{"dur":4,"text":"But unless we all follow up and press onward\nthe advantage will be lost."},"1057":{"dur":2,"text":"Yesterday's success will not do for

Premier."},"1072":{"dur":2,"text":"So I wanted to begin by asking you."},"1075":{"dur":5,"text":"You've said, you're often asked what it's\nlike to be a woman and to be premier and I"},"1081":{"dur":4,"text":"wondered if after two years as the leader\nof a majority government, you just spoke about"},"1085":{"dur":4,"text":"a number of issues where a critical mass of\nwomen in

issue and said, \"I as a\nwoman care about this and because I'm premier"},"1100":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm gonna take this on personally and it's\ngonna go?\""},"1102":{"dur":7,"text":"KW: Well, there are a number of those, and\nI identified a couple of them I think that"},"1110":{"dur":1,"text":"we could..."},"1111":{"dur":8,"text":"I can tell you that in our recent budget,\nthe changes around post-secondary education"},"1119":{"dur":5,"text":"and tuition, those were issues that are very\nnear and dear to my heart but there were other"},"1125":{"dur":6,"text":"women, staff and otherwise who were pushing\nvery hard to make those changes so that we"},"1131":{"dur":6,"text":"could ensure that there would be more access\nto post-secondary education for young

women."},"1146":{"dur":6,"text":"So when I first became premier, so I have\nbeen premier about three years now, you're"},"1152":{"dur":5,"text":"right, two years in a majority government,\nbut in the first year when I was at the Council"},"1158":{"dur":3,"text":"of the Federation meeting with the other premiers\nthere actually were six women at the table,"},"1161":{"dur":4,"text":"there were six premiers that year, and it\nwas sort of a moment in time and it was one"},"1166":{"dur":4,"text":"of those moments where people were saying,\n\"Oh do you think this means history's

your breath\", and\nnow we've got three, so..."},"1181":{"dur":6,"text":"KW: But it was a moment, and when we sat with\nthe National Aboriginal Leaders that year"},"1187":{"dur":7,"text":"in 2013, it was very interesting because it\nwas the year that the National Aboriginal"},"1195":{"dur":4,"text":"Leaders were starting to ramp up the call\nfor national enquiry on missing and

between\nrural women and urban women and how would"},"4002":{"dur":6,"text":"we go about that because it's very clear to\nme that urban Ontario does not really understand"},"4009":{"dur":5,"text":"rural Ontario, in particularly the agricultural\nsector where women are very, very predominant."},"4015":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, what can we do about that?"},"4016":{"dur":1,"text":"Thanks so much."},"4017":{"dur":1,"text":"KW: That's a great question."},"4018":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I've got four great questions here."},"4020":{"dur":6,"text":"I'm just gonna go through them quickly and\nthen I know we have to wrap up."},"4026":{"dur":4,"text":"So, maybe I'll start with the streaming question."},"4031":{"dur":5,"text":"Some of you who have been in education for\na while will remember that decades ago we"},"4037":{"dur":3,"text":"had a big debate about streaming and de-streaming\nin Ontario."},"4040":{"dur":7,"text":"And in fact, there was a push to de-stream\nthe education system."},"4047":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think that the debate is coming up again\nbecause we are still seeing that there are"},"4053":{"dur":5,"text":"certain groups of kids who are not achieving\nat the level of other kids."},"4058":{"dur":4,"text":"And that is a challenge and it's a problem\nfrom my perspective."},"4063":{"dur":5,"text":"KW: If you look at Liz Sandals, our Minister\nof Education, look at her mandate letter from"},"4068":{"dur":6,"text":"me, you will see in it that I have asked her\nto focus on strategies that actually would"},"4075":{"dur":2,"text":"recognize that there are certain groups of\nkids."},"4077":{"dur":7,"text":"So, aboriginal kids, kids of color, kids of\nspecial needs, kids in care, there are groups"},"4085":{"dur":2,"text":"of students who do not do as well."},"4088":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, we are working on strategies to address\nsome of those things."},"4092":{"dur":1,"text":"We're not there."},"4094":{"dur":6,"text":"There is some sign that that is changing a\nbit."},"4100":{"dur":6,"text":"But, just so everyone is clear, there is no\ninstitutional streaming in the Ontario education"},"4106":{"dur":1,"text":"system."},"4107":{"dur":8,"text":"What happens is there are particular groups\nof kids who end up taking certain courses"},"4116":{"dur":8,"text":"for a variety of reasons and we haven't sorted\nout how to prevent some of that differentiation."},"4124":{"dur":6,"text":"But, it's not institutionalized and it's not\nanything that we think is acceptable."},"4130":{"dur":5,"text":"KW: Women's Economic Forum and women in technology,\none of the questions I have about women in"},"4136":{"dur":10,"text":"technology is when I go into some of the startup\ncenters and I see the young people who are"},"4146":{"dur":6,"text":"involved in a lot of the technological innovation,\nI worry that there aren't as many women as"},"4152":{"dur":1,"text":"there are men."},"4154":{"dur":2,"text":"That is actually a concern of mine."},"4157":{"dur":7,"text":"Because there are tax credits in place, there\nare supports for startup and scaling up companies."},"4164":{"dur":3,"text":"We've made that a real focus of our government."},"4167":{"dur":5,"text":"But, it is a conversation I've had with groups\nof young men in technology about what is it"},"4173":{"dur":7,"text":"about technology that doesn't draw as many\nwomen as it should and that's related to the"},"4180":{"dur":5,"text":"conversation about STEM, so the Science Technology\nEngineering and Math courses where we see"},"4186":{"dur":3,"text":"women leaving at a greater rate than young\nmen."},"4190":{"dur":5,"text":"So, if anybody has answers on that, I would\nlove to hear that because we have made a focus"},"4195":{"dur":5,"text":"on technology and we need to figure out how\nto get more women into it."},"4200":{"dur":3,"text":"KW: New innovations, I love the idea of focusing\non good things are happening."},"4204":{"dur":3,"text":"We just need to get the media to report on\ngood

what"},"4223":{"dur":8,"text":"sells papers, sells radio spots, sells social\nmedia."},"4232":{"dur":7,"text":"So, I don't know the answer to that except\nthat I think that we do need to, as a society,"},"4240":{"dur":4,"text":"tell each other the good stuff, because there\nis so much good going on."},"4244":{"dur":4,"text":"Every time I go into a high school or into\na college and I see what is happening, the"},"4248":{"dur":3,"text":"young minds that are at work, it's just phenomenal."},"4252":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I couldn't agree more about that."},"4255":{"dur":8,"text":"KW: Rural and urban Ontario, I think there's\na degree to which there is a rift."},"4263":{"dur":4,"text":"I also think there's a degree to which we\nmake more of it than we should, and that we"},"4268":{"dur":5,"text":"should, again, talk about the similarities\nand not just the differences."},"4274":{"dur":3,"text":"But, I just want you to know that Jeff Leal\nwho is your

isolation"},"4312":{"dur":5,"text":"in rural communities in a different way than\nphysical isolation in urban communities."},"4317":{"dur":3,"text":"Of course, we have isolation in our urban\ncentres."},"4321":{"dur":7,"text":"But the vulnerability of rural women who are\nliving in poverty is quite, is quite graphic."},"4328":{"dur":1,"text":"So one of the things, for example..."},"4329":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll just end on this."},"4331":{"dur":7,"text":"KW: We're trying to work to provide transportation\noptions for women in rural communities,

regulation\non some of these things in the past."},"4357":{"dur":7,"text":"But having those small community transportation\nsolutions, putting some money into that, would"},"4364":{"dur":5,"text":"be something that would actually address a\nproblem that rural women talk about, because"},"4369":{"dur":2,"text":"transportation can be a huge concern."},"4372":{"dur":3,"text":"So we know that there
