{"0":{"dur":1,"text":"[MUSIC PLAYING]"},"15":{"dur":2,"text":"Doctor Oro, thanks so\nmuch for joining me."},"17":{"dur":2,"text":"You gave an incredible talk\nand discussed this idea"},"19":{"dur":1,"text":"of therapeutic reprogramming."},"20":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes."},"21":{"dur":1,"text":"Can you tell me what that means?"},"22":{"dur":0,"text":"Sure."},"23":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a long word\nthat's hard to say,"},"26":{"dur":5,"text":"but the idea is that with a\nconfluence of stem cell biology"},"31":{"dur":2,"text":"and the ability\nto edit the genome"},"34":{"dur":2,"text":"to fix errors in the DNA."},"37":{"dur":3,"text":"We have the ability now to\nmake personalized stem cells"},"41":{"dur":2,"text":"for you, for each\nindividual, and then"},"43":{"dur":3,"text":"take those stem cells\nand then manufacture"},"46":{"dur":3,"text":"broken or diseased\norgans in the body."},"49":{"dur":4,"text":"And so the idea is that in\nthe past we'd have surgery,"},"53":{"dur":2,"text":"or if it's bad you cut\nit out, and medicine"},"56":{"dur":1,"text":"where you can give them a pill."},"58":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you have a diseased\norgan that you can't cut out"},"60":{"dur":2,"text":"because you need it,\nlike a heart or the skin,"},"62":{"dur":2,"text":"or the brain, or the\npancreas, for instance,"},"65":{"dur":3,"text":"now we have the capability\nof actually making"},"68":{"dur":2,"text":"personalized stem cells then\ngenerating those organs for you"},"71":{"dur":1,"text":"to put it back in\nfor transplantation."},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can grow someone\na heart made just"},"75":{"dur":1,"text":"for them from their own cells?"},"77":{"dur":3,"text":"So the big picture really\nis that these embryonic stem"},"80":{"dur":3,"text":"cell like cells called\ninduced pluripotent cells have"},"84":{"dur":2,"text":"all instructions you need\nto make organs in your body,"},"87":{"dur":3,"text":"because they did it\nbefore when you were born."},"90":{"dur":1,"text":"And so now, just\ngoing back in time,"},"91":{"dur":2,"text":"taking these cells that have\nthe instructions to make"},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"the organs for you,\nand then developing"},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"recipes, if you will, to\nthen manufacture the organs."},"99":{"dur":3,"text":"Now obviously,\nthat's the concept."},"102":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we've done\nthis for skin, where"},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"we can take diseased\niPS cells and then"},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"correct genetic\ndefects for predicted"},"110":{"dur":3,"text":"diseases such as\nepidermolysis bullosa,"},"113":{"dur":3,"text":"which is a disease where your\nskin comes off because you're"},"116":{"dur":1,"text":"missing one of 12 proteins."},"118":{"dur":2,"text":"Correct that little defect, and\nthen manufacture the skin back"},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"so we graft it on the\npatient and correct it."},"123":{"dur":2,"text":"So you're fixing their\ncell outside their body"},"125":{"dur":0,"text":"and then giving it back to them."},"126":{"dur":1,"text":"That's really fascinating."},"127":{"dur":0,"text":"That's right."},"128":{"dur":3,"text":"And so the idea is that you need\na number of different things."},"131":{"dur":1,"text":"Sort of the talk\nwas about, you need"},"133":{"dur":1,"text":"to be able to make,\nto manufacture"},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"in the clinical\ngrade these iPS cells"},"136":{"dur":1,"text":"for each individual person."},"138":{"dur":3,"text":"And then correct the genetic\ndefect, manufacture the cells,"},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"but then the key is to\nthen have scaffold and bio"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"engineer them in the right\nway so that they'll actually"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"incorporate into the body\nand into a normal way."},"150":{"dur":1,"text":"You can't just stick it in?"},"151":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, I mean you\ncould use a shoe horn,"},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"but really those four things\nare really what we need"},"157":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's where we're moving\nin the future here at Stanford."},"160":{"dur":1,"text":"That's so exciting."},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"Has it happened with any\norgans beside the skin?"},"165":{"dur":1,"text":"Have you been able to\ndo a heart or a lung"},"166":{"dur":1,"text":"or anything of that nature?"},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, So if you look back,\nwe've been for many years"},"172":{"dur":1,"text":"now doing bone\nmarrow transplants,"},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"where you can take bone\nmarrow cells and bone marrow"},"175":{"dur":0,"text":"transplant."},"176":{"dur":2,"text":"And in fact, many older\nmen have been doing it"},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"with hair transplants."},"181":{"dur":4,"text":"So those are like the earliest\nstem cell transplants."},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"Truth in advertising, I\nhave not had that yet."},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"But now we're trying\nto develop new organs"},"191":{"dur":1,"text":"that we can't do easily."},"193":{"dur":3,"text":"And the first actually is\ngoing to be probably done"},"196":{"dur":3,"text":"by the group in Japan\nfor macular degeneration."},"199":{"dur":0,"text":"For eyes."},"200":{"dur":1,"text":"For eyes."},"201":{"dur":4,"text":"And then after that with their\nlead, as well here at Stanford"},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"we'll hopefully move into\nskin and other organs"},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"as well using our new\ncell facility that we're"},"212":{"dur":1,"text":"building here at Stanford."},"214":{"dur":3,"text":"Do all tissues have the\nability to have stem cells?"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"Can we find these, as you said,\nthese pluripotent stem cells"},"220":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"So the big a-ha in stem cell\nbiology in the last decade"},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"is that every organ\nin the body has"},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"a group of cells that they\nset aside for a rainy day"},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"in case they need to regenerate."},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"And the question really is, not\nreally do they have stem cells,"},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"but how do you coax them out."},"236":{"dur":5,"text":"And also, how to get enough of\nthem to regenerate the organ."},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the blood, for\ninstance, does it all the time."},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"Your skin regenerates\nall the time as well,"},"246":{"dur":4,"text":"but other organs such as\nheart, or your brain, there's"},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"small subsets that\nhave these stem cells,"},"254":{"dur":1,"text":"but you have to be able\nto try to expand them."},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"That's really difficult."},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"So another way to do it is to\nmake these embryonic stem cells"},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you can grow\nthem at large quantities"},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"and then generate this\nhuge manufacturing"},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"to make the tissues."},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"The trick is though\nto incorporate them"},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"into the tissue\na functional way."},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's going to be easier\nfor some tissues than others."},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"So for example, the\nneural connections,"},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"you can probably stick\nsome cells in there,"},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"but the connections that\ndefine your personality,"},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"your memories, and your\nexperience, that's going"},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"to be really hard to replicate."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're not going to go\nstick a new brain in someone,"},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"that probably wouldn't work?"},"292":{"dur":0,"text":"No I don't think so."},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, Frankenstein\nnot withstanding, I"},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"think we're not going\nto be able to do that."},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"But aspects of that\nwill be helpful."},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"This is really exciting\nwork you're doing."},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you much for\nspeaking with me."},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"Yep, thanks for having me."},"304":{"dur":0,"text":"Yep."},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"[MUSIC PLAYING]"}}
