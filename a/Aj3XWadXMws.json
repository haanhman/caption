few years later,"},"150":{"dur":3,"text":"you start to see little glimmers of\nit happening in the energy space."},"153":{"dur":4,"text":"And so you start to connect some\ndots there and I'd say for us,"},"158":{"dur":5,"text":"probably about maybe 2008,\nwe started to really pick our head up."},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"And really by 2011 or so we said,"},"165":{"dur":4,"text":"this is serious and

stage,\nwe thought it was either or."},"254":{"dur":3,"text":"It was software versus hardware."},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we embedded it, first,\nin our research center,"},"260":{"dur":3,"text":"because that was really where we\nwere doing the technical R and D."},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"Can we get the kind of look\nat what do we need to do?"},"266":{"dur":4,"text":"What's the technology that's going to\nempower and enable this digital world?"},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"And then pretty soon there after we\nhad to start empowering sales and"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"marketing teams and\ngetting all the businesses on board,"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"but that's really been\nthe journey of the past."},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"And so to answer your question finally,\nbut I think so"},"282":{"dur":4,"text":"now we know what our destiny is for\ncertainly the next decade or more."},"286":{"dur":3,"text":">> We're a digital industrial

important."},"296":{"dur":3,"text":">> And it seemed like you guys took\na remarkably iterative process to kind of"},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"get there, because just to kind of\ncontinue, what I was saying like,"},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"at first, it looked kind of crazy."},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"Like what are you guys talking about\nindustrial internet like just sounds like"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"the internet, but\ncoming from GE or something."},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"So maybe, just bigger and more expensive."},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"So-\n>> [LAUGH]"},"314":{"dur":1,"text":">> But then it kind of started,"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"you could connect the dots of\nwhat the internet could do"},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"to the various products you guys had."},"320":{"dur":4,"text":"Did you know what of sort of change that\nwould drive within the business at first?"},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"Or did you actually like, did it kind\nof come together in slow pieces?"},"328":{"dur":3,"text":">> It's definitely I think the one\nthing you know as well as anybody,"},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"it's always an iterate."},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"I think generally in companies,\nthere's an iterative process and"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"it drives people crazy,\nbecause they expect it to be done."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think first,\nwe had to just understand,"},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"do we have the right technology,\nthe sensors and controls?"},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"What are the applications?"},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"What's the opportunity?"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"So one of the first things we did really\nwas just, if that name it, claim it,"},"350":{"dur":0,"text":"here's the market."},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"We started to say, hey,"},"352":{"dur":4,"text":"we think this is going to unlock a whole\nnew wave of productivity in industry."},"356":{"dur":4,"text":"And we decided, hey, even if we\ncould unlock 1% of productivity."},"361":{"dur":4,"text":"In the health care industry,\nthat's $600 million."},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"In the rail business,\nthat's multiple hundreds of millions and"},"368":{"dur":0,"text":"you start to add up,"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"it's like trillions of dollars worth of\nproductivity in the industries we serve."},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"So hey, there are markets there."},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"What are the applications?"},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"And so in the early days, it was a lot\nof goofy applications, to be honest."},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"They were one-offs,\nlet's just see if we can do it."},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"Then over time, you start to say,\nhey, an application in rail,"},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"actually we're going to track\nwhere our locomotives are."},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"That same application works in a hospital."},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"The nurse wants to find where all\nthe healthcare pieces of equipment are."},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"So you start to see the disparate pieces,"},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"actually fit together more\nhorizontally than anything."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":">> But you guys could have sort\nof delivered that as just, okay,"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"now GE's products are smarter there,\nmore intelligent."},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"But it seems like there was an overall\nbusiness model shift that came"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"along with rhe industrial internet,\nwhat was that shift?"},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"How and where are you guys\nin that journey right now?"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":">> Well, it's one of the points\nthat was raised earlier."},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"There were two shifts, the technology."},"421":{"dur":4,"text":"The hardware engineers are not good at\nsoftware, so you had to convince them that"},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"this was a different kind of engineering\ncapability that had to be embedded."},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"We actually have a lot of software\ncapability in various pieces, we now had"},"434":{"dur":4,"text":"to aggregate them, hire more and then we\nwere totally lost on the commercial side."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"What are we selling?"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"Are we selling an app?"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"Are we selling a service?"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"We had to get to the point and\nsomeone mentioned it here earlier,"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"that we're selling an outcome."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, if you're driving productivity,\nwhat does it mean?"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to give you\nno unplanned downtime."},"451":{"dur":4,"text":"If you're running a power plant and you\ndon't expect that gas turbine to go down,"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"that's millions and\nmillions of dollars a day."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"So again, you started to say,\nwhat is it and"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"you could see that across\nthe whole company."},"462":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we had to import new software\ntechnology and new sales and"},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"marketing technology."},"468":{"dur":3,"text":">> And is that something that's sort of\nfully standardized across the business or"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"are these sort of unique relationships\nthat you have with a bunch of your"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"customers where you guys get into a room\nand you say, okay, we're going to save you"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"$2 billion, give us half of that and\nthen you go on your way, or"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"is that something that's fully kind of\nprogramatized or productized across the-"},"485":{"dur":1,"text":">> It's a little of both in the beginning."},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to figure it out customer\nby customer, industry by industry."},"489":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'd say the good news for\nus is our customers weren't ready either."},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"So we weren't ready and\nthey weren't ready but"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"we were all ready to see the vision and\nhave the discussion."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"And we had to come up with\na customer maturity model."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"That some of our most\nsophisticated customers were ready."},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"Most of them weren't ready at all."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"They didn't even know what\nwe were talking about."},"508":{"dur":2,"text":">> So it worked out really well."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"We could take each other along."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"But that's something you always have."},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"When you're kind of making a market,"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"you're dealing with varying degrees\nof maturity of your customers."},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"The other thing that's interesting is,"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"who is your customer?"},"522":{"dur":4,"text":"You're calling in a much higher order\nthat's about productivity of operations."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"You're suddenly becoming\na partner in operating a railroad,"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"operating an airline."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"Your customer's no longer,\nit's only the procurement officer,"},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not your service officer."},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"It's the CFO, the CEO, the CIO."},"538":{"dur":4,"text":"So suddenly the CIO's in this really\ninteresting position of doing operational"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"technology and information technology."},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"So you're also having to change the role\nof the people that you work with"},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"in the customer level."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":">> Did you start this with\none group inside of GE or"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"did you try to roll it out across\nall the divisions simultaneously?"},"556":{"dur":0,"text":">> A little of both."},"557":{"dur":5,"text":"GE is pretty good at doing kind of\ncentralized centers of expertise and"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"so we brought in the technology and\nthe commercial capabilities."},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, everybody tried to tap into\nthat and it frankly didn't scale."},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"So we, just last year, had to come in and\nsay we don't enough heft."},"574":{"dur":5,"text":"Everybody's all in, we have one digital\ncenter running it like a business."},"579":{"dur":4,"text":"And they drive the implementation,\nthe commercialization, and"},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"then they pivot back to the businesses."},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"That was a huge cultural shift for us."},"589":{"dur":3,"text":">> Have you had to do anything to\nensure that that business unit then,"},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"that group is not slowed down by the sort\nof motions of the overall company?"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":">> Yeah, and partly it's co-locating."},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"We have a software center\nout in the East Bay."},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"And we've now got about 2,500\nSoftware Engineers and Data Analysts and"},"607":{"dur":5,"text":"all kinds of as you'd imagine\nsophisticated technologists."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"But we had to say,\nif you're in healthcare,"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"you have to put your digital team here."},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"The chief digital officer for\nenergy sits in San Ramon, and"},"620":{"dur":6,"text":"he has to port back to the power and\nwater business in France, in Schenectady."},"627":{"dur":5,"text":"So that was reestablishing the center of\nexpertise, and now we're a global company."},"632":{"dur":6,"text":"So now we're setting up digital foundries\nin Shanghai, in Israel, in France."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"So then you have to also figure out\nhow you are distributed to serve"},"642":{"dur":0,"text":"Global Market."},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"So now we're at that phase."},"644":{"dur":4,"text":">> But did you ever have then\nthese junctures where what"},"648":{"dur":4,"text":"the digital team was building, or the\nsoftware group at the time was building,"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"wasn't competitive either on cost or"},"655":{"dur":0,"text":"performance with something-\n>> [COUGH]"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":">> That one of those teams could have"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"gotten from the outside market?"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"Did you have to sort of force\nthem to use it anyway for"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"the product development process and\nimproving that?"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"Or did you let them go\na different direction?"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"How did you deal with the fact that,\nthat this thing was so"},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"early and\nhow do you let it kind of blossom?"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":">> Well, if this gives you any indication,"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"we just released Predix which\nis our industrial Cloud."},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"We just opened it up for\ngeneral availability two weeks ago."},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"So you might well imagine\nsome of our business units"},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"were ready before\nthe industrial Cloud was ready."},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"So there had to be a transition plan."},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"So you had to say to the rail business,\nthere are certain things you need to"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"move forward on because your\ncustomer is expecting it, but"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"know at some point we're going to have\nto manage the cost and the transition."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"We had to create Cloud that\nis on premise in the Cloud,"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"they had to create secure parts,\nopen parts."},"706":{"dur":0,"text":"We had to partner with that,"},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"we do partner with Amazon Web Services\nto get some of that speed."},"711":{"dur":5,"text":"So you had to come up with a real\nmosaic of options if you will for"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"the business units."},"719":{"dur":4,"text":"Sometimes they did it better, over\ntime they had to know this centralized"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"Predix Stack is where they're going to be,"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"and they had to figure out\nhow to manage to that."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":">> I think we're going to get a lot\nmore end of the Predix bottle in"},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"that because that's a pretty\ninteresting example of you guys"},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"inventing a new software business\non top of the GE kind of core."},"737":{"dur":5,"text":"But before that if you move into a model\nwhere you are selling outcomes for"},"742":{"dur":5,"text":"your customers and you are a service\nprovider, not just selling a product."},"748":{"dur":5,"text":"Do you ever run into issues where now\nyou're competing with previous partners or"},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"suppliers in your industry that were\na step between you and the customer or"},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"the ultimate product?"},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"How have you guys navigated that?"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":">> I'd say we're navigating it now and\nit rings in a whole new,"},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"I mentioned earlier that CIO\nwho's now super important to us."},"767":{"dur":6,"text":"And they are making critical decisions and\nthey're being called on by SAP, IBM, GE."},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"And everybody thinks it's\nan IT solution when actually"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"we're offering an OT solution."},"778":{"dur":4,"text":"So partly you have to kind of duke it out\na little bit and for us it was coming with"},"783":{"dur":5,"text":"the operational expertise,\nnot trying to do, and ERP implementation."},"789":{"dur":1,"text":">> Right.\n>> We're not good at that."},"790":{"dur":4,"text":"But we're good at what we're, so you do\nfind that kind of conflict because none of"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"us really have figured out what it\nmeans in the industrial Internet."},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"So we had to work through that,\nwe still are."},"800":{"dur":2,"text":">> And I assume you can then be with\nmany of the system integrators."},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"The Accentures of the world, people had\nto package all this up together, or"},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"is that-\n>> I think we partner more with those."},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"I think you're seeing us do a lot\nmore with Accenture, Cap Gemini,"},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"some of those kind of system

partnering."},"818":{"dur":4,"text":">> So that's an example of you guys\ncompeting with, sort of, ostensibly,"},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"previous partners."},"824":{"dur":4,"text":"Do you ever find yourself competing with\nthe actual end customer of your technology"},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"because you're jumping a step ahead\nof them in terms of delivering
