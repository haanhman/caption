she"},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"had a capacity for thinking--\nfor thinking about the past,"},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"analyzing what had happened, and\nprojecting it into the future."},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's this third capacity\nthat helped her enormously"},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"and also gets us into\na lot of trouble,"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"because it turns

type 2 error, that's"},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"the end of her DNA line."},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"So we developed minds and\nbrains that are really, really"},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"good at these type 1 errors."},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"Our minds, as my friend\nRick Hansen puts it,"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"are like Velcro\nfor bad experiences"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"and Teflon for good
