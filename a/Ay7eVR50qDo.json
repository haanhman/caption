two years old,\nand we had to completely retrofit it."},"897":{"dur":3,"text":"But we did, and we saved \nabout 500,000 litres in a year."},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"And, uh, ourselves and Bentall

parking lot median,"},"911":{"dur":1,"text":"uh, is a great intent,"},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"but when they put in \nthe water delivery system,"},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not well done \nand that's what happens."},"919":{"dur":1,"text":"So the other way that, uh,"},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"there's, there's savings potential \nin our industry,"},"922":{"dur":1,"text":"are how things are scheduled."},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"Typically, things are set up to run,\nuh, the same in May."},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"So they set- a contractor \nwill set it up to run in May,"},"930":{"dur":1,"text":"and they'll come back in October \nto turn it off."},"932":{"dur":1,"text":"A- the problem is"},"934":{"dur":2,"text":"that the water requirement\nat the landscape

uh,\ntechnologies are changing"},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"that allow controllers \nto automatically adjust their schedules."},"947":{"dur":1,"text":"Uh, flow sensors\nare something that are out there"},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"that allow us to detect leaks \nand shut down things remotely."},"952":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's a leak."},"953":{"dur":1,"text":"Uh, this- you know,\nthis is what we

five million litres a year,"},"963":{"dur":2,"text":"but they never knew,\n\"Well, should we be using two million?\""},"966":{"dur":2,"text":"So, uh,\nthat's really what we specialize in."},"969":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is one thing that excites me \nis the connected home."},"971":{"dur":2,"text":"And in our industry right now,\nth- there's a big shift, uh,"},"974":{"dur":2,"text":"toward these Nest type products,\nso thermostats."},"977":{"dur":1,"text":"Uh, I brought an example of one."},"978":{"dur":2,"text":"This is e- equivalent to, uh,\na Nest

control it \nfrom your computer."},"1013":{"dur":1,"text":"It integrates \nwith home automation systems."},"1016":{"dur":1,"text":"You can talk to it now."},"1018":{"dur":3,"text":"Uh, you can tell Amazon's Alexa\nto water your front yard for ten minutes"},"1022":{"dur":1,"text":"and it'll integrate \nwith this unit and do it."},"1024":{"dur":2,"text":"So stormwater management \nis the other

resources"},"1401":{"dur":1,"text":"is just our growing population."},"1403":{"dur":1,"text":"So the, the GTA, for example,"},"1405":{"dur":3,"text":"is expected to grow \nby almost 40 percent by 2036."},"1408":{"dur":2,"text":"And so when you have \na growing population, they need water."},"1411":{"dur":1,"text":"So you need to provide water \nto those people."},"1414":{"dur":2,"text":"One way you can do that \nis to just build more infrastructure."},"1417":{"dur":1,"text":"So build more \nwater treatment systems,"},"1419":{"dur":2,"text":"build more pipes, more pumps \nto get that water to more people,"},"1422":{"dur":2,"text":"or you can take \nthe conservation approach,"},"1425":{"dur":4,"text":"so reduce, reuse, and recycle \nthe existing water

actually cheaper \nto pay people to use less water,"},"1436":{"dur":3,"text":"than it is to build,\nthan it is to build new infrastructure."},"1442":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'll just start showing a few\nin Ontario,"},"1444":{"dur":1,"text":"Waterloo, Toronto,\nGuelph, and York Region,"},"1445":{"dur":1,"text":"and for this presentation,"},"1447":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll specifically focus on

regions."},"1456":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're retained by City of Waterloo,\nCity of Guelph, and York Region"},"1460":{"dur":3,"text":"to go into businesses \nand find ways for them to reduce water,"},"1464":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's a free service \nto the client."},"1466":{"dur":1,"text":"So they pay us to do that,\nthe region does,"},"1468":{"dur":2,"text":"and the businesses \nget that audit for free."},"1470":{"dur":4,"text":"If businesses implement something,\nso say they m- changed out"},"1474":{"dur":2,"text":"a water cooled equipment \nfor an air cooled equipment,"},"1476":{"dur":2,"text":"the regions will also pay them\nsome money"},"1479":{"dur":1,"text":"based on the water \nthat they saved."},"1482":{"dur":1,"text":"Toronto's programs,\nthey have two separate ones,"},"1484":{"dur":1,"text":"one's called \nthe Industrial Water Rate,"},"1486":{"dur":1,"text":"and that one's \njust for industrial companies,"},"1488":{"dur":1,"text":"and the Capacity Buy Back Program,"},"1490":{"dur":1,"text":"which is for commercial \ninstitutional facilities,"},"1492":{"dur":4,"text":"so, you know, hospitals, hotels,\nschools, colleges, universities."},"1499":{"dur":1,"text":"For Toronto's \nIndustrial Water Rate Program,"},"1501":{"dur":3,"text":"the water audit must be completed\nby a professional

implemented \nunder their program."},"1512":{"dur":1,"text":"There's also verifications visits"},"1513":{"dur":1,"text":"to make sure \nthat the equipment is being installed"},"1515":{"dur":1,"text":"and is saving the water \nthat it said it was going to save."},"1518":{"dur":1,"text":"And the facilities do this"},"1520":{"dur":1,"text":"and get on the Industrial \nWater Rate Program,"},"1522":{"dur":1,"text":"they're entitled to a water rate"},"1523":{"dur":2,"text":"that's 30 percent less \nthan the standard rate."},"1525":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's a significant savings \nfor, for companies,"},"1528":{"dur":1,"text":"especially when the price\nis gonna increase"},"1530":{"dur":1,"text":"to four dollars a cubic metre \nin a few years."},"1536":{"dur":2,"text":"For the Capacity Buy Back Program,\nit's a little bit different."},"1538":{"dur":1,"text":"Again, it has to be\na professional engineer"},"1540":{"dur":1,"text":"that conducts the audit."},"1541":{"dur":3,"text":"An any permanent process change\nthat results in water savings"},"1545":{"dur":1,"text":"can be eligible for an incentive."},"1546":{"dur":1,"text":"So again, the City of Toronto,"},"1548":{"dur":2,"text":"if you install something,\nit saves you water,"},"1550":{"dur":2,"text":"they will pay you 30 cents \nper litre that you saved,"},"1552":{"dur":2,"text":"um, based on,\num, the assessment."},"1556":{"dur":3,"text":"So again,\nthese are really big incentives"},"1559":{"dur":2,"text":"for, for businesses\nto help keep them in Toronto"},"1561":{"dur":2,"text":"and attract more business to Toronto \nby offering these types of programs."},"1564":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's an economic, um, benefit,\nbut it also helps conserve"},"1567":{"dur":2,"text":"the existing water capacity \nthat Toronto has."},"1571":{"dur":2,"text":"So how do you actually do an audit?\nWhat's involved?"},"1573":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, the most important step \nis collecting reliable data."},"1577":{"dur":2,"text":"So whether it's using,\nyou know, ultrasonic flow metres,"},"1579":{"dur":1,"text":"or just bucket \nand stopwatch measurements,"},"1581":{"dur":1,"text":"you wanna collect accurate data,"},"1583":{"dur":2,"text":"'cause it allows you to do accurate \nbefore and after comparisons."},"1587":{"dur":1,"text":"So in this example, um,"},"1588":{"dur":2,"text":"before they're using \nabout 120 gallons per minute"},"1591":{"dur":1,"text":"using a certain type \nof spray nozzle,"},"1592":{"dur":2,"text":"they switched \nto a higher efficiency spray nozzle,"},"1595":{"dur":2,"text":"and they use \nless than 20 gallons per minute."},"1597":{"dur":2,"text":"Because there was good accurate data,\nyou can make a very good calculation"},"1600":{"dur":1,"text":"about how much money\nthey should get back"},"1602":{"dur":1,"text":"based on the water savings."},"1605":{"dur":1,"text":"Once you've collected your data"},"1606":{"dur":1,"text":"and you know where the water \nis being used in the facility,"},"1608":{"dur":1,"text":"you wanna prioritize it."},"1610":{"dur":1,"text":"It's called a pareto analysis."},"1612":{"dur":2,"text":"So you wanna focus\non processes A, B, and C"},"1614":{"dur":2,"text":"because you're gonna get much better\nopportunities for saving water"},"1617":{"dur":2,"text":"than if you focused \non F, G, and H for example."},"1621":{"dur":1,"text":"Once you know \nwhere most of your water is being used,"},"1623":{"dur":3,"text":"then you can start brainstorming ideas \nto reduce that water consumption."},"1628":{"dur":1,"text":"And the final step,\nand the very important one,"},"1630":{"dur":2,"text":"is to bring it down \nto a business case."},"1632":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, companies say"},"1634":{"dur":2,"text":"they wanna be environmentally friendly,\nthey wanna save water,"},"1636":{"dur":1,"text":"but at the end of the day,\nthey're there to make money."},"1638":{"dur":2,"text":"So if there's not an economic incentive \nto do something,"},"1641":{"dur":1,"text":"often it doesn't get implemented."},"1643":{"dur":2,"text":"So bringing it down to business case,\nso in this example,"},"1645":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe 70,000 dollars \nto install a cooling tower,"},"1648":{"dur":2,"text":"the annual savings,\noperation maintenance savings,"},"1651":{"dur":2,"text":"from 50,000 dollars,\nit's a 1.3 year payback."},"1653":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a pretty good investment\nfor a company to make"},"1656":{"dur":2,"text":"that saves water,\nand also makes a good business case."},"1659":{"dur":1,"text":"'Cause that's a key step \nin this whole process."},"1663":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's look at a case study \nof how this works in reality."},"1666":{"dur":2,"text":"Um, this one\nis about Fruition Fruits & Fills"},"1669":{"dur":1,"text":"which is owned by Tim Hortons."},"1670":{"dur":1,"text":"And you probably guessed \nwhat's coming next."},"1672":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's our donut \nthat we saw at the beginning."},"1675":{"dur":1,"text":"So we went in to Fruition"},"1677":{"dur":2,"text":"and looked at where they were using,\nuh, water,"},"1679":{"dur":1,"text":"and found\nthat most of their water"},"1680":{"dur":1,"text":"was being used \nto clean the fondant machine."},"1682":{"dur":1,"text":"So the fondant makes\nthose nice thick icings"},"1684":{"dur":1,"text":"that go on top of donuts."},"1687":{"dur":1,"text":"And when we first started,"},"1689":{"dur":3,"text":"basically, they just pour water \ninto the machine and dump it out,"},"1692":{"dur":2,"text":"pour it in the machine, dump it out,\nuntil the water came out clean,"},"1695":{"dur":1,"text":"then they would do \nthe next batch of icing."},"1697":{"dur":2,"text":"So they used \na lot of water in this process."},"1700":{"dur":2,"text":"We worked with their team\nto basically switch them from"},"1703":{"dur":2,"text":"a batch process \nto a continuous process."},"1705":{"dur":3,"text":"So instead of making a flavour,\ncleaning it,"},"1708":{"dur":1,"text":"making the next flavour,\ncleaning it,"},"1710":{"dur":3,"text":"they'd have a one wron- long run\nof the same flavour"},"1714":{"dur":3,"text":"or they'd go from light to dark,\nso they wouldn't have to switch out"},"1717":{"dur":1,"text":"and clean it every single time."},"1719":{"dur":3,"text":"So that went from, they were cleaning \nevery 16 hours previously,"},"1722":{"dur":2,"text":"to only having to clean that \nonce per week."},"1724":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was \na really huge water savings."},"1728":{"dur":1,"text":"Another interesting thing\nin the plant was"},"1730":{"dur":1,"text":"you notice the icing sugar \non the floor."},"1731":{"dur":3,"text":"So their workers would take \nthose Kraft bags of sugar,"},"1735":{"dur":3,"text":"go up the stairs, slit them open,\npour them into the mixing vessels."},"1738":{"dur":1,"text":"And as you can see,\nthey didn't always hit the target."},"1740":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's always\nicing sugar on the floor,"},"1742":{"dur":1,"text":"which meant\nthat people always had hoses"},"1744":{"dur":1,"text":"washing that down the sewer."},"1746":{"dur":1,"text":"Again, really high water use."},"1747":{"dur":2,"text":"And also, wet floors are not good \nfor health and safety either."},"1751":{"dur":3,"text":"So again, we worked with them \nto move to a super sack system."},"1754":{"dur":3,"text":"A super sack is just a,\na gigantic bag of icing sugar."},"1757":{"dur":2,"text":"And they hard piped it\nto the vessel"},"1760":{"dur":1,"text":"so that there was no way\nfor the icing sugar"},"1761":{"dur":1,"text":"to get on the ground."},"1763":{"dur":1,"text":"So when there no more icing sugar \non the ground,"},"1765":{"dur":2,"text":"there's no more water that's needed \nto wash it down the sewer,"},"1767":{"dur":2,"text":"and your, your floors are dry as well,\nwhich is safer."},"1773":{"dur":1,"text":"So just the water savings alone"},"1775":{"dur":2,"text":"was almost 100,000 dollars \nper year for this facility,"},"1778":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's, \nit's only a 40 person facility as well."},"1780":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a very small one."},"1781":{"dur":2,"text":"And they also did energy and looked at,\nuh, waste reduction as well,"},"1784":{"dur":2,"text":"and they actually saved\nclose to half a million dollars"},"1786":{"dur":1,"text":"overall in this assessment."},"1790":{"dur":2,"text":"There's also a very interesting\nsocial aspect to this story"},"1792":{"dur":1,"text":"because the plant manager\nat the time"},"1794":{"dur":2,"text":"decided to donate \na percentage of the savings,"},"1797":{"dur":3,"text":"um, to, to sponsor the construction \nof biosand filters in South Sudan."},"1800":{"dur":2,"text":"And so those are those blue filters \non the screen there."},"1804":{"dur":3,"text":"And they're currently providing\nabout 800,000 litres per year"},"1807":{"dur":2,"text":"of, of safe drinking water \nto communities in South Sudan."},"1811":{"dur":2,"text":"So this case study with Tim Hortons"},"1813":{"dur":2,"text":"was a great example \nof where there were economic savings,"},"1816":{"dur":2,"text":"um, there's a reduced \nenvironmental footprint,"},"1818":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's also a very compelling \nsocial story as well."},"1821":{"dur":2,"text":"And in fact, a few years ago,\nthey won a national sustainability award"},"1824":{"dur":1,"text":"for, for that project."},"1827":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's how donuts changed the world.\n[laughs]"},"1830":{"dur":1,"text":"So just to recap briefly,"},"1831":{"dur":2,"text":"um, there's some great \ngovernment programs in Ontario."},"1835":{"dur":1,"text":"They save businesses money,"},"1836":{"dur":2,"text":"they help preserve \nour existing water resources,"},"1839":{"dur":2,"text":"so we don't have to use more water \nfor our, for our cities,"},"1842":{"dur":2,"text":"and also, there are benefits \nto sos- society for everybody"},"1844":{"dur":2,"text":"when there's less water being used \nfor our purposes."},"1847":{"dur":3,"text":"And again, water's an amazing substance,\nthere's no substitute,"},"1850":{"dur":1,"text":"uh, we share it \nwith our global

effect \nto benefit people globally,"},"1860":{"dur":2,"text":"uh, like we saw in the case study \nwe went through lastly there."},"1865":{"dur":2,"text":"If you'd like to learn a bit more \nabout some of the topics I covered,"},"1868":{"dur":1,"text":"there are a few resources there."},"1869":{"dur":2,"text":"Uh, thesafewaterproject.org,\nthat's our not for profit,"},"1872":{"dur":1,"text":"uh, project I talked about."},"1874":{"dur":2,"text":"CAWST.org,\num, it's located in Calgary,"},"1877":{"dur":1,"text":"and they have some\nreally great information"},"1878":{"dur":1,"text":"on ho- how those \nbiosand filters work."},"1881":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't get into those today \n'cause it's kinda a bit technical,"},"1883":{"dur":1,"text":"but if you la- \nwanna learn more about them,"},"1884":{"dur":1,"text":"it's a great resource."},"1886":{"dur":2,"text":"Uh, City of Toronto, you can goo- \nGoogle them and their programs"},"1889":{"dur":1,"text":"to learn more \nabout their water conservation efforts."},"1891":{"dur":1,"text":"And as well, if you wanna l- \nlearn more about what we do,"},"1893":{"dur":1,"text":"our website is on, \non there as well."},"1896":{"dur":1,"text":"Well thank you very much \nfor your

tall."},"1941":{"dur":3,"text":"Um, so thank you for inviting me \nto be here today, uh, Taylor."},"1944":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to be speaking \na bit about water quantity,"},"1946":{"dur":1,"text":"water quality,\nand water availability"},"1948":{"dur":2,"text":"through the lens of \nEnvironmental Defence's water program."},"1952":{"dur":3,"text":"So to begin,\nwhen we talk about water security,"},"1955":{"dur":1,"text":"we think about water scarcity."},"1957":{"dur":2,"text":"So we think about \nthe lack of water."},"1960":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's basically when our demand \nexceeds the supply."},"1964":{"dur":3,"text":"But what do we need that water for?\nAre we drinking it?"},"1968":{"dur":2,"text":"Are we bathing with it?\nAre we irrigating?"},"1970":{"dur":2,"text":"And what quality of water \ndo we need for these activities?"},"1973":{"dur":2,"text":"For instance, does the quality of water\nthat we need for drinking"},"1976":{"dur":3,"text":"equate to the quality of water \nthat we use for flushing the toilet?"},"1980":{"dur":2,"text":"And what's the water quality\nthat we also need to think about"},"1983":{"dur":3,"text":"when it comes to our ecosystems,\nuh, not just our health?"},"1987":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm getting a bit wonky there."},"1989":{"dur":3,"text":"So the Environmental Defence\nGreat Lakes program looks at, uh,"},"1993":{"dur":3,"text":"working towards implementing strong,\neffective legislation and policy,"},"1997":{"dur":2,"text":"keeping phosphorous \nout of the lakes."},"1999":{"dur":2,"text":"So phosphorous is a fertilizer,"},"2001":{"dur":3,"text":"which is great on the fields,\nit helps grow our crops,"},"2004":{"dur":1,"text":"but in the lakes it's pollution."},"2006":{"dur":1,"text":"And then putting a price \non plastic pollution,"},"2008":{"dur":2,"text":"uh, specifically water bottles,\nwhich I'll get to in a bit."},"2013":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's agreements and legislation\ncurrently in place"},"2016":{"dur":1,"text":"that create a policy framework"},"2018":{"dur":2,"text":"that supports \nthis ethical water stewardship."},"2020":{"dur":2,"text":"One example, is the Great Lakes\nLawrence River Basin"},"2022":{"dur":1,"text":"Sustainable\nWater Resource Agreement"},"2024":{"dur":1,"text":"that was signed\nby eight Great Lake states"},"2026":{"dur":1,"text":"and the province \nof Ontario and Quebec."},"2028":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is basically a framework\nto talk about water diversions"},"2031":{"dur":1,"text":"and water quantity issues."},"2033":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there's the Water Opportunities\nand Water Conservation Act,"},"2035":{"dur":1,"text":"which was passed in 2010."},"2037":{"dur":1,"text":"And then this helps promote"},"2039":{"dur":2,"text":"water conservation plans \nat the municipal scale,"},"2041":{"dur":2,"text":"while also creating \na clean tech sector within Ontario,"},"2043":{"dur":2,"text":"and to promote the kind of technologies \nthat we heard, um,"},"2046":{"dur":2,"text":"both, uh,\nChris and Lloyd speak about earlier."},"2050":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is just\nto give you an example"},"2051":{"dur":3,"text":"of how policy can influence, uh,\nwater conservation."},"2056":{"dur":1,"text":"And now, um,"},"2058":{"dur":2,"text":"there's the Waukesha Diversion,\nwhich you may have heard of in the news."},"2060":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is the first test case \nof the agreement that I just mentioned."},"2063":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a municipality, um,\nin Wisconsin"},"2066":{"dur":2,"text":"that's looking to increase \ntheir water supply."},"2069":{"dur":2,"text":"They say that they have exhausted \nall alternatives,"},"2071":{"dur":2,"text":"um, and they'd like to draw"},"2074":{"dur":2,"text":"about 10.1 million gallons \nof water per day."},"2077":{"dur":2,"text":"The trouble is\nthis is a municipality"},"2079":{"dur":2,"text":"that is just outside \nthe Great Lakes Basin,"},"2081":{"dur":1,"text":"and therefore it's a test \nto the agreement."},"2084":{"dur":2,"text":"Um, so Environmental Defence,\nwhat we're trying to ask"},"2087":{"dur":3,"text":"and what we'd like you to all help,\num, ask the Premier to do as well,"},"2090":{"dur":1,"text":"is to oppose this diversion."},"2092":{"dur":2,"text":"The decision will be pending, um,\nin the spring."},"2095":{"dur":2,"text":"Uh, though Ontario\ndoesn't have the ability"},"2098":{"dur":1,"text":"to deny Waukesha's request,"},"2100":{"dur":1,"text":"this is something that rests with\nthe compact"},"2101":{"dur":2,"text":"which is basically a similar agreement \nto that that I mentioned,"},"2104":{"dur":3,"text":"but without both, uh, \nQuebec and Ontario being present."},"2108":{"dur":2,"text":"What Ontario can do,\nas can Quebec,"},"2110":{"dur":4,"text":"is to review the, the proposal \nby the, um, municipality."},"2115":{"dur":3,"text":"And as an independent report \nhas found,"},"2120":{"dur":1,"text":"there are alternatives, um,"},"2121":{"dur":2,"text":"to expanding \ntheir municipal water supply."},"2123":{"dur":2,"text":"They could treat the water,\num, at less of a cost"},"2126":{"dur":2,"text":"than diverting it \nfrom, um, Lake Michigan."},"2129":{"dur":1,"text":"So one thing that you can do,"},"2131":{"dur":2,"text":"is you can go right on our website \nand sign the petition,"},"2134":{"dur":1,"text":"or better yet,\nas Krystyn was saying,"},"2136":{"dur":2,"text":"you can also go speak \nat public hearings."},"2139":{"dur":2,"text":"Um, the second issue\nthat I'd like to talk about"},"2141":{"dur":1,"text":"is algal blooms in Lake Eerie."},"2143":{"dur":2,"text":"So this year,\nwe had the most severe of the century"},"2146":{"dur":1,"text":"according to NOA."},"2148":{"dur":1,"text":"Um, so as I mentioned,"},"2150":{"dur":2,"text":"one of the reasons \nwhy there's algal blooms"},"2152":{"dur":1,"text":"is because of too much fertilizer."},"2154":{"dur":3,"text":"But it could also be\nbecause of leaking, uh, septic systems"},"2157":{"dur":2,"text":"because of combined \nsewer overflows,"},"2161":{"dur":2,"text":"um, and other municipal sources \nas well."},"2166":{"dur":2,"text":"And luckily, there's also\nlegislation agreements in place"},"2168":{"dur":1,"text":"from the federal \ndown to the provincial level,"},"2170":{"dur":1,"text":"and most recently, \nthe Great Lakes Protection Act"},"2173":{"dur":2,"text":"that looks at creating\nlegislative framework"},"2175":{"dur":3,"text":"that enables both the federal government\nand the provinces to take action"},"2179":{"dur":2,"text":"towards reducing phosphorous pollution \nwithin Lake Eerie."},"2184":{"dur":2,"text":"Environmental Defence released a report \nback in 2014,"},"2187":{"dur":3,"text":"and we looked at four different things \nthat could be done to tackle this issue."},"2191":{"dur":2,"text":"So one was creating \nthe policy framework."},"2193":{"dur":2,"text":"Um, and that still \nneeds to be implemented."},"2196":{"dur":1,"text":"So though the act is passed,"},"2197":{"dur":1,"text":"there's still work \nthat needs to be done."},"2199":{"dur":2,"text":"There's building water smart cities,\nand cultivating water smart citizens."},"2202":{"dur":3,"text":"So we just heard some terrific examples \nfrom our earlier panelists."},"2206":{"dur":1,"text":"Improving science \non why blooms happen,"},"2208":{"dur":1,"text":"um, and understanding \ntheir implications."},"2210":{"dur":2,"text":"So for instance,\ninvasive species and climate change,"},"2213":{"dur":2,"text":"what way do they interact\nwith the pollution"},"2215":{"dur":2,"text":"that's entering the lake \nto make the blooms even worse?"},"2217":{"dur":2,"text":"One example is Phragmites\non the shoreline"},"2220":{"dur":2,"text":"and how it might kill new species \nthat act like as a f- as a filter."},"2224":{"dur":3,"text":"Um, there's harnessing market forces \nto help farmers reduce nutrient runoff."},"2228":{"dur":3,"text":"So our farmers are important,\nthey bring food to the table,"},"2231":{"dur":4,"text":"um, and we're trying to find ways \nthat help incentivize them,"},"2235":{"dur":2,"text":"uh, to take the actions necessary \non field."},"2239":{"dur":3,"text":"So an example of those \nwould be planting riparian buffers,"},"2243":{"dur":4,"text":"um, taking marginal land off \nand putting wetlands in place instead,"},"2248":{"dur":3,"text":"uh, planting cover crops \nlike alfalfa or switchgrass,"},"2251":{"dur":3,"text":"changing the way that, um,\nthe cattle graze."},"2254":{"dur":2,"text":"These are all things \nthat could be done on land,"},"2257":{"dur":2,"text":"however, they are at an added cost \nto the farmers,"},"2259":{"dur":5,"text":"so we're looking at ways \nto be able to improve the practices,"},"2265":{"dur":5,"text":"uh, without hampering \nwhat's a very challenging, uh, task."},"2272":{"dur":3,"text":"Um, and one way, um,\none thing that needs to happen"},"2275":{"dur":2,"text":"is a little bit more investment \nin the Great Lakes."},"2277":{"dur":2,"text":"So Environmental \nCommissioner Ontario"},"2279":{"dur":3,"text":"released a report earlier,\nuh, towards the end of, uh \u2013"},"2283":{"dur":3,"text":"I guess it's, yeah, it's 2016 \u2013\num, towards the end of last year,"},"2287":{"dur":2,"text":"um, saying that there needs to be \nmore investment in the Great Lakes."},"2290":{"dur":2,"text":"One, uh,\npoint that they brought up"},"2292":{"dur":4,"text":"was that Ontario covers only 1.2 percent\nof 16.2 million it spends"},"2296":{"dur":2,"text":"on water quantity \nmanagement programs."},"2299":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's specific \nto water permitting programs."},"2302":{"dur":3,"text":"Um, but then again, there's other areas \nwhere we could be investing more."},"2305":{"dur":2,"text":"So one thing that you can do \nis as an environmental citizen,"},"2308":{"dur":3,"text":"tell your MPPs, um,\ntell your MPs as well, or councillors,"},"2312":{"dur":2,"text":"to invest in safeguarding water \nand protecting the Great Lakes."},"2316":{"dur":2,"text":"Um, and this is...\nYou can go in on Fridays,"},"2318":{"dur":3,"text":"when they tend to have constit days,\nyou can write letters, sign petitions,"},"2321":{"dur":2,"text":"but also be a bit more active \nin other ways as well."},"2324":{"dur":1,"text":"Tweet them.\nA lot of them have Twitter accounts."},"2328":{"dur":2,"text":"And now, we believe \nthat everyone deserves clean water,"},"2330":{"dur":2,"text":"but some are taking more \nand paying less."},"2333":{"dur":2,"text":"So with the example that I gave\nof the amount of money"},"2335":{"dur":2,"text":"that the province isn't being able,\nisn't able to recoup"},"2338":{"dur":1,"text":"in the permitting program,"},"2339":{"dur":3,"text":"uh, one of the challenges \nis that, um,"},"2342":{"dur":2,"text":"some types of industries,\nlike water bottlers,"},"2345":{"dur":4,"text":"only pay $3.14 \nto take a million litres of water a day."},"2349":{"dur":2,"text":"Um, so that's, that's quite a bit."},"2352":{"dur":3,"text":"And we think that water bottles\nare an unnecessary waste."},"2355":{"dur":2,"text":"So one of the new campaigns \nthat we'll be launching very soon,"},"2358":{"dur":2,"text":"um, is about putting a price \non plastic pollution."},"2361":{"dur":2,"text":"So not only does it take\nabout a quarter of this"},"2364":{"dur":3,"text":"to, uh, produce the bottle,\nto transport it, to cool it,"},"2367":{"dur":1,"text":"once these are produced,"},"2369":{"dur":2,"text":"not all of them \nactually end up being recycled."},"2371":{"dur":3,"text":"Um, only about 50 percent \nin Ontario do."},"2375":{"dur":3,"text":"And a lot of them end up \nin our landfills where they can leach,"},"2378":{"dur":1,"text":"or they end up in our lakes \nand our rivers."},"2380":{"dur":1,"text":"And these guys,\nthey don't biodegrade."},"2382":{"dur":1,"text":"They just breakdown\ninto smaller bits"},"2384":{"dur":2,"text":"that can get eaten by fish \nand other wildlife,"},"2386":{"dur":1,"text":"and then they make their way \nback up the food chain."},"2390":{"dur":3,"text":"So one thing that we're gonna propose \nis a deposit return program."},"2393":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of other provinces \nand jurisdictions in Canada have it,"},"2397":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's shown to be really effective,\nabout 90 to 95 percent returns."},"2401":{"dur":1,"text":"We're already familiar \nwith the system."},"2402":{"dur":4,"text":"We do it with our beer cans \nand our, um, wine bottles."},"2407":{"dur":1,"text":"Uh, so imagine doing this with"},"2408":{"dur":1,"text":"other types \nof beverage containers as well."},"2411":{"dur":5,"text":"And the benefit of this would be that \nit would help, uh, fund pro- programs..."},"2417":{"dur":1,"text":"to help implement \nthe Great Lakes Protection Act,"},"2419":{"dur":1,"text":"uh, to help meet \nour binational commitments."},"2421":{"dur":1,"text":"It would help fund programs"},"2423":{"dur":3,"text":"to incentivize farmers \nto take action to protect Lake Eerie,"},"2427":{"dur":3,"text":"lead to improved waste diversion,\nas well as increasing jobs."},"2432":{"dur":3,"text":"So back to other things \nthat you could do."},"2435":{"dur":2,"text":"Um, so all the previous panelists"},"2438":{"dur":2,"text":"have given \na lot of really great examples,"},"2440":{"dur":2,"text":"um, and that's the challenge \nof coming at the end."},"2442":{"dur":3,"text":"Um, but a few more that you could do \nis, uh, learn about water issues."},"2446":{"dur":2,"text":"So figure out where\nyou can go down to the lake"},"2448":{"dur":1,"text":"and where you can touch it."},"2449":{"dur":1,"text":"Be active in your community."},"2451":{"dur":1,"text":"Conserve water at home \u2013"},"2453":{"dur":4,"text":"if it's taking shorter showers \nor, um, installing a rain barrel."},"2458":{"dur":1,"text":"Be a water savvy tourist."},"2460":{"dur":2,"text":"Um, try to apply\nthose same practices"},"2462":{"dur":2,"text":"when you travel in places \nwhere there is more water scarcity."},"2466":{"dur":1,"text":"Use a refillable water container."},"2467":{"dur":1,"text":"Um, this is a really big one."},"2469":{"dur":3,"text":"We have really clean, safe,\ndrinkable tap water"},"2472":{"dur":1,"text":"that comes from Lake Ontario\nand that's treated,"},"2474":{"dur":1,"text":"and instead \nwe're buying bottled water."},"2476":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm really happy \nthat there's no bottled water here."},"2478":{"dur":2,"text":"Um, I didn't even have to say anything,\nso thank you, Taylor."},"2481":{"dur":2,"text":"Um, moving to \nthe non-toxic products,"},"2484":{"dur":2,"text":"because microbeads and other things\nin our beauty products"},"2486":{"dur":1,"text":"can get into the lake,"},"2488":{"dur":2,"text":"and disposing \nof toxic substances properly."},"2490":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"2492":{"dur":5,"text":"[applause]"},"2500":{"dur":1,"text":"[moderator]\nThanks, Natalijia."},"2501":{"dur":3,"text":"And thanks to all of our speakers.\nThis is, uh, so much interesting stuff."},"2505":{"dur":1,"text":"Um, I was thinking,"},"2507":{"dur":1,"text":"I was struck by \na lot of what you've said,"},"2508":{"dur":2,"text":"but I was thinking, sorry,\nparticularly, Chris,"},"2511":{"dur":1,"text":"when you were talking about"},"2512":{"dur":3,"text":"the incredible amount of water \nthat's used in irrigation."},"2515":{"dur":2,"text":"Um, for one thing,\nI had no idea that turf grass"},"2518":{"dur":1,"text":"was the largest crop \nin North America."},"2520":{"dur":2,"text":"Um, and thinking through the lens \nof international development,"},"2523":{"dur":4,"text":"when you hear about an irrigation system\nusing 120 litres of water per minute"},"2528":{"dur":3,"text":"and thinking about our sphere standards \nthat dictate, you know,"},"2531":{"dur":4,"text":"a minimum of 15 litres of water \nper person per day... for survival,"},"2536":{"dur":3,"text":"it really puts it in, in stark, uh,\nstark contrast."},"2541":{"dur":1,"text":"So just to, to get started,"},"2543":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm gonna open it up \nfor questions in a second,"},"2544":{"dur":2,"text":"but, I guess, listening,\nChris and Lloyd specifically,"},"2547":{"dur":3,"text":"to, to the two of you talk about, sorta,\nthe business case for conservation,"},"2550":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm wondering if you could \u2013\nand... and others jump in as well \u2013"},"2554":{"dur":2,"text":"um, tell us a little bit more about"},"2556":{"dur":3,"text":"what is the most effective, sort of, \ninitiative that you've seen"},"2560":{"dur":2,"text":"based on a business case\nor otherwise"},"2562":{"dur":2,"text":"that, that has really,\nuh, prompted change"},"2564":{"dur":2,"text":"in clients or other people \nin the industry that you interact with."},"2567":{"dur":1,"text":"Is there policy or initiative"},"2569":{"dur":3,"text":"that really stands out as, you know,\nthat, that really made an
