different suburbs."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"And it does so in a\nvery nice, optimal way."},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"It makes these nice\ntriangulation patterns"},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"where it can

that\nToshi and his colleagues"},"246":{"dur":4,"text":"did is that they\nsaid, well, can we"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"compare how the humans\nsolve this problem"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"and how the slime\nmolds solved it?"},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"And it turns out that\nthe slime molds came up"},"257":{"dur":3,"text":"with pretty much a smart\nsolution to the Tokyo network"},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"problem as the humans did."},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they were able\nto solve it and produce"},"267":{"dur":3,"text":"these minimal spanning trees or\nthese

they\nconnected up the network."},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"Then they looked at\nthe British Rail system"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"and how the slime mold\ncompared to the

solution."},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"OK."},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"So how do slime molds\nconnect to Barcelona, right?"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, let's start by\nlooking at a goal."},"302":{"dur":4,"text":"This is one of the greatest\nfootball teams of all time."},"306":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the Barcelona\nteam of 2010-2011,"},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"which won the Champions League."},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"And this, of course,\nis Lionel Messi."},"313":{"dur":4,"text":"One pass, two pass,\nand into goal."},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just an amazing run\nwhere he basically goes"},"320":{"dur":6,"text":"past eight players and gets the\nball into the back of the net."},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just wonderful to watch."},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"But what I wanted\nto do is, well,"},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"think about what's\nactually going on there."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, when you're\nlooking at this,"},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"you're probably looking\nmostly at Messi."},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"But there's a very\ninteresting thing"},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"if we look at some\nof the other players."},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"So now I've taken-- I've\ntracked the positions of all"},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"of the players and I've put them\ndown onto the football pitch."},"347":{"dur":4,"text":"And we can see that\nMessi is over there"},"351":{"dur":4,"text":"and Xavi is over here."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we have Iniesta here."},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I've done is\nmade a triangulation,"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"very similar to what happens\nwith the slime molds,"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"connecting all of these players."},"365":{"dur":4,"text":"And you see this really lovely\ntriangulation between Xavi here"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"and Iniesta and you have\nthe opposing players"},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"are sort of caught\nin the middle."},"374":{"dur":4,"text":"And Xavi is perfectly placed\nbetween these one, two, three,"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"four, five other players."},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"He's right in the\nmiddle of them."},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"And by moving into the\nmiddle at the same time"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"he produces a triangle\nwhere he can then"},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"take the ball from Messi and\npass it on to the next player."},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"So we can actually break this\ndown as a Voronoi diagram"},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"and see that the\nopposing players are"},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"stuck on the line\nbetween Xavi and Messi,"},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"which makes it very easy\nfor him to do the pass."},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"Then what does Messi do next?"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, this is Pedro."},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"Just now he's standing\nmarked by another player."},"412":{"dur":4,"text":"But one second later, when\nMessi has moved forward,"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"you see suddenly that Pedro is\nstanding in the middle of one,"},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"two, three, four."},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just a subtle movement,\njust one meter away,"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"produces the same\ntriangular effect again."},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is what Barcelona do\ntime after time after time."},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"They create space and\nthrough creating space,"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"they create these triangles\nwhich they can pass."},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"Once Pedro has done that,\nthe ball goes to Pedro."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"This is just in a\none-meter space."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"And Messi is through."},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"And so when we watch it\nagain, we see pass one."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"Pass two, Pedro\nmoved into space."},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"And the goal goes in."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"So that was the whole\nstructure between"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"that particular Barcelona team."},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"Now I've been\nworking with data--"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"I've been writing articles\nfor \"FourFourTwo\" magazine"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"and working with data from Opta."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"And now we can actually\nlook at the whole passing"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"network throughout the match."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is Barcelona\nversus Arsenal."},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"This is now\nmodern-day Barcelona."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"This was the season match\nwhere they knocked Arsenal out"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"of the Champions League."},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"And again we can see\nvery nice selection"},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"of triangles between Messi\non this side and Dani Alves"},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"and Rakitic."},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"And then up at the top, we\nhave Neymar, Iniesta, and Alba."},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"And what I love about\nthe Barcelona network,"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"it just has this sort\nof perfect symmetry."},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"You basically have\nMessi and two players,"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"you have Neymar and\ntwo players, you"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"have Busquets which\nyou can go back to,"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you have Suarez\nat the tip of it all."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's a sort of\nsymmetry down the middle."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"And by looking at the passes\nthat all of the players made,"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"you can identify what are the\nkey components of Barcelona."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"What makes them such\na successful team?"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"And I've been doing--\nI got really into this."},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"When I got hold\nof this Opta data,"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"it was so much fun to make\nall of these different passing"},"520":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a different type of\npassing network I've made."},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"This is from earlier in\nthe season, Manchester City"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"versus Leicester."},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is a\npassing network which"},"531":{"dur":4,"text":"shows the average pass position\nbetween different players."},"535":{"dur":4,"text":"So up here is the average\nplace that Sterling"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"passed to Kolarov."},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the average place\nKolarov passed off to Sterling."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we can build up a\nconvex hull which connects"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"all of these passing points."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"And you get an idea of\nwhere is the territory"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"for these different places."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's interesting to see\nthat Sterling placed basically"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"across the two wings,\nand this is something"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"that Manchester City do."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can get a\nvery nice idea, which"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"goes above the normal\nformations of a football match,"},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"of how a team works together."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's the basic network\nconnection, and the starting"},"574":{"dur":0,"text":"with the slime mold."},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"The next thing that\nI wanted to look at"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"was the flow of the game."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's a chapter in the\nbook called Check My Flow."},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"And the starting point\nfor this was an experiment"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"done by Messi Moussaid."},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"He did a very simple experiment,\nbut it's a very nice and useful"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"experiment."},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"He placed-- he did it in France."},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"And he placed-- had\nhad two students."},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"So one of them stood here\nand the other student"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"was walking towards\nthe stationary student."},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"And what this vector\nfield shows you,"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"what all the arrows\nshow you, is the effect"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"that a stationary student\nhas on a moving student."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"And so he's taken away-- they've\nalways got forward motion,"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"but you can see they've slowed\ndown when they're in this area."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"And if they're off to the\nleft, they go off to the left,"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"and if they're off to the\nright, they go off to the right."},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"And he actually found that there\nwas a small, small bias-- maybe"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"a sort of 60-40 bias--\nthat these arrows are just"},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"a bit stronger off to the right."},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's a sort\nof bigger tendency"},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"to go off to the right."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"And this means when you have\ntwo walking students who"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"meet each other,\nthey end up passing"},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"each other on the right."},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"And so this is a\nnice example of how"},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"you can model individual\ninteractions in humans"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"and work out what's going on."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"So what I wanted to\ndo was use this type"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"of vector field, this type\nof flow field approach,"},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"in order to understand what's\ngoing on in a football match."},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"This is another one of\nmy very favorite players."},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"Up here is Andrea Pirlo."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"He's just got the ball\nhere and he puts it across."},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"So watch what Pirlo does now."},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"He sort of strolls around."},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"He has this beautiful style\nof just he doesn't even"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"look like he can run properly."},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"He kind of moves\nthere over there,"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"he sort of strolls around\nwith the ball a little bit"},"681":{"dur":0,"text":"like this."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"Oh, I've fallen over."},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, I'm not really\ngoing to do anything here."},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll just stand here for a bit."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"He just places this\nbeautiful pass out"},"691":{"dur":5,"text":"to a free player, one more pass,\nand then the ball is suddenly"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"in the middle and it's a goal."},"698":{"dur":4,"text":"This was the semifinal\nof the Euro 2012."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's really Pirlo's\nmode of operation."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"He was one of the key\nplayers in that game."},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"Time and time again, he was\nin the middle of the field"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"standing there and\nthen putting out"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"these passes in\ndifferent directions."},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I can do is I can\nproduce the same type of flow"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"field for Pirlo."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"And I like to call him the eye\nof the storm, because basically"},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"he has this operation area."},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a heat map of where\nhe's most often passing from."},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"And if he's on the\nright-hand side,"},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"he tends to pass out to the\nleft, which he did in the video"},"736":{"dur":0,"text":"we saw."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"If he's on the left, he\npasses out to the right."},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's his operation."},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"He's really tightly constrained\nto a particular point"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"and making these passes\nout in different direction."},"747":{"dur":4,"text":"This is the average data-- well,\nI've fitted a model to this,"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's the average\ndata taken over a match."},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you can compare\nto other players."},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"So Schweinsteiger\nplays for Germany."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"And he would actually say\nthat he-- in that match,"},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"he played the same\nmidfield position as Pirlo,"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"but he has a completely\ndifferent vector"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"field or flow field."},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"He is moving everywhere\naround the pitch."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"He has these long passes in this\ndirection and some going out"},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"that direction, and he\nmoves much more around."},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think if Pirlo is\nthe eye of the storm,"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"then Schweinsteiger\nis a tornado that"},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"just engulfs the whole pitch."},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"And what I like about this is\nit's sort of like an analogy"},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"here, or there's a\nsort of prediction."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like a weather\nforecast prediction."},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"If we look at that,\nwell, now we've"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"got a forecast of\nhow Schweinsteiger"},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"is going to play."},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is exactly how he\nplayed in the World Cup final."},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"He was everywhere in the World\nCup final two years later."},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"And I don't think\nhe single-handedly"},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"won the World Cup\nfinal, but he was"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"one of the absolute key\nplayers in doing it."},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"So you sort of have\na weather forecast"},"813":{"dur":4,"text":"which predicts how a player\nwill play in future matches."},"817":{"dur":6,"text":"And what's been nice to do\nnow looking at this Opta data"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"is to do this for players."},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is Riyad\nMahrez, who's been"},"828":{"dur":4,"text":"one of the successful players\nfor Leicester this season."},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"He plays out on\nthe right midfield."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can see exactly\nwhere Mahrez is."},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"You know this is where he's\ngoing to be, that black thing,"},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can also see where\nhe's passing the ball."},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"This shows why\nit's so effective."},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"The ball keeps flowing\nin, in this direction."},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"This is where Vardy\nis, for example."},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"All of his passes\nare creating chances"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"going in that direction."},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"And you can use this technique\nto compare different players."},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"Because we're in London,\nI mean-- actually"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"because we're in London, you're\nprobably all Manchester United"},"866":{"dur":0,"text":"fans."},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"But I thought I'd show you\nsome of the leading attacking"},"871":{"dur":4,"text":"midfielders for the London team."},"876":{"dur":4,"text":"So Eden Hazard for Chelsea up\nthere, Mesut Ozil for Arsenal,"},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"Christian Eriksen for Spurs,\nand Dimitri Payet for West Ham."},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"And ostensibly\nthese players play"},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"in round about\nthe same position,"},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"but they have very\ndifferent attacking arrows."},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"Eden Hazard has had\na really bad season,"},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"and you can sort of see why."},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"If you compare to Ozil\non the right here,"},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"Ozil's passes are always moving\nforward in this direction"},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"while Eden Hazard is passing\nmore into the middle."},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"So he's not making\nthe ball move forward."},"908":{"dur":1,"text":"Christian Eriksen is\ndoing a pretty good job"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"of making the ball move forward."},"912":{"dur":2,"text":"And Payet is doing\nvery long passes."},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"These are crosses into the box."},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"And so he's moving the\nball in a good direction."},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can get an idea\nof the style of play"},"923":{"dur":2,"text":"of the different players\nand whether they're"},"925":{"dur":1,"text":"effective in this play."},"929":{"dur":1,"text":"OK."},"930":{"dur":4,"text":"So up to now I've been\nlooking at on-the-ball data."},"935":{"dur":3,"text":"I've been looking at when the\nplayer has the ball, where"},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"is the player moving\nto the ball to."},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"But there's more and more\ntechnology available now"},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"to actually track all of the\nmovement of all of the players."},"948":{"dur":2,"text":"This data is collected\nby individuals,"},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"by people watching the match\nand saying who's got the ball"},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"and tracking the\npositions on the pitch."},"956":{"dur":2,"text":"But it is actually possible\nto automate it, automatically"},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"track all of the\npositions of the players."},"961":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the kind of\ninteresting problem"},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"that I'm sure you guys are\ninterested in at Google."},"968":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I have a chapter on the\nWorld in Motion, I call it,"},"972":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's where I really\nlike to think about what

then"},"1436":{"dur":1,"text":"very effective in striking."},"1437":{"dur":2,"text":"But you see this\nterritory at the back,"},"1439":{"dur":2,"text":"and what Leicester have also\nbeen extremely good in doing"},"1442":{"dur":4,"text":"is that they own this territory\nfurther up at the front"},"1446":{"dur":3,"text":"and they're often getting the\nball back up here, which allows"},"1449":{"dur":1,"text":"them to do very fast attacks."},"1451":{"dur":1,"text":"Or if the ball\ncomes up from Kante,"},"1453":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe Vardy doesn't\nget it first time"},"1455":{"dur":2,"text":"but he recovers it\nvery quickly and then"},"1457":{"dur":2,"text":"he can continue\nto attack on goal."},"1459":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see where the\ndefensive territories are."},"1462":{"dur":3,"text":"And I did a study\nback in February"},"1465":{"dur":3,"text":"looking at what is it\nthat makes Leicester"},"1469":{"dur":3,"text":"different from the other

effective."},"1538":{"dur":1,"text":"One last thing I didn't\nsay about this plot"},"1540":{"dur":3,"text":"is that the size of the circle\nis the number of chances"},"1544":{"dur":1,"text":"generated by the teams."},"1545":{"dur":3,"text":"So Arsenal had an\nincredible number of chances"},"1548":{"dur":1,"text":"but unfortunately they\ndidn't have the strikers"},"1550":{"dur":1,"text":"to score any of the goals."},"1552":{"dur":4,"text":"And Leicester City\nhad less chances"},"1557":{"dur":1,"text":"but they were very effective\nin converting them."},"1561":{"dur":5,"text":"Then lastly, this is now a\nseason network of-- Leicester"},"1566":{"dur":2,"text":"were very nice because they have\npretty much the same players"},"1569":{"dur":2,"text":"on the pitch\nthroughout the season"},"1571":{"dur":3,"text":"and so you can get a good\nidea of who was passing who."},"1574":{"dur":3,"text":"So the circle here\nis how many shots"},"1578":{"dur":1,"text":"from the danger zone\nin front of goal"},"1580":{"dur":1,"text":"were done by a\nparticular player."},"1581":{"dur":2,"text":"So Vardy is this\nmassive circle here,"},"1584":{"dur":2,"text":"but even Huth is a\npretty big circle."},"1586":{"dur":1,"text":"Doesn't mean he shot from there."},"1587":{"dur":1,"text":"He shot closer in."},"1588":{"dur":2,"text":"But this is the typical\nposition that they pass from."},"1591":{"dur":4,"text":"And you can get an idea of how\nLeicester move the ball around."},"1596":{"dur":4,"text":"Kante is the central point\nthat's connecting up

it?"},"2213":{"dur":3,"text":"I think there is something\nto learn in there, because we"},"2216":{"dur":2,"text":"can see there is a statistical\ndifference between them."},"2219":{"dur":3,"text":"So and what you see in football\nis this constant evolution."},"2222":{"dur":2,"text":"So the Barcelona\nteam of 2010-11,"},"2225":{"dur":2,"text":"there were lots of teams\nwhich tried to copy that."},"2228":{"dur":4,"text":"Like, Swansea tried to do this,\nand Arsenal to some degree"},"2232":{"dur":1,"text":"have tried to play like this."},"2233":{"dur":1,"text":"And now it doesn't work anymore."},"2234":{"dur":3,"text":"You can't attack through the\nD because-- I think really"},"2238":{"dur":1,"text":"Mourinho is credited with this."},"2240":{"dur":2,"text":"He came up with, well,

the\nedges as much as they wanted"},"2254":{"dur":1,"text":"because they were\nall tiny so they"},"2256":{"dur":2,"text":"couldn't cross in to the\nplayers in the middle."},"2258":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's one thing where you\nsee this tactical evolution."},"2262":{"dur":3,"text":"And Leicester seem to\nhave evolved a system"},"2266":{"dur":2,"text":"that the others weren't\nready to handle."},"2268":{"dur":3,"text":"And the problem with\nArsenal is possibly"},"2272":{"dur":1,"text":"they were actually\nmaximizing something."},"2274":{"dur":3,"text":"They were maximizing-- we\noften call this expected goals."},"2277":{"dur":1,"text":"They were maximizing\nthat shots should"},"2279":{"dur":2,"text":"come from a certain area,\nand the other teams knew"},"2282":{"dur":2,"text":"that they were\nmaximizing that and then"},"2284":{"dur":1,"text":"they started blocking it."},"2285":{"dur":1,"text":"And then Arsenal didn't do well."},"2287":{"dur":2,"text":"But they had no strategy\nfor dealing with Leicester."},"2289":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's this constant\nevolution and feedback."},"2292":{"dur":2,"text":"And, yeah,

ridiculous odds."},"2318":{"dur":3,"text":"That means like 1 in 5,000 years\nthat they would win the League"},"2321":{"dur":2,"text":"and, like, it's only\n20, 30 years ago"},"2324":{"dur":1,"text":"since, like,\nNottingham Forest were"},"2325":{"dur":3,"text":"winning the League and other\nteams in Ipswich and so on."},"2328":{"dur":1,"text":"So, no, it's not

in\nreal trouble last season"},"2380":{"dur":4,"text":"and then maybe the last eight\nor nine games they won a lot of."},"2384":{"dur":2,"text":"Have you sort of done the\ngraphs and pinpointed the

last season\nvs this season,"},"2391":{"dur":3,"text":"and they weren't doing these\nlonger passes in that way"},"2395":{"dur":0,"text":"last season."},"2396":{"dur":0,"text":"So there was a change."},"2397":{"dur":2,"text":"But what I didn't account\nfor is, as you were saying,"},"2399":{"dur":3,"text":"is if there might be a time\npoint during last season"},"2402":{"dur":1,"text":"that they made a transition."},"2403":{"dur":1,"text":"So over the whole\nseason, they weren't"},"2405":{"dur":2,"text":"doing what they did this\nseason, but possibly at the end"},"2408":{"dur":0,"text":"they were."},"2416":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: Did you\ntake a look at how"},"2418":{"dur":3,"text":"single player behaves under,\nlike, different managers?"},"2421":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's say, for\nexample, in the club"},"2423":{"dur":2,"text":"versus like national team."},"2425":{"dur":3,"text":"So, like, Vardy is\nwaiting for long balls"},"2428":{"dur":2,"text":"basically and scores a\nlot of goals in League."},"2431":{"dur":2,"text":"But perhaps he's not the\nbest choice for England"},"2433":{"dur":1,"text":"because the

Yeah."},"2442":{"dur":0,"text":"It's true."},"2443":{"dur":2,"text":"So I've got--\nyeah, one example I"},"2446":{"dur":3,"text":"think is nice about that is\nthis Schweinsteiger

German team."},"2455":{"dur":1,"text":"And he certainly\nwasn't allowed to play"},"2457":{"dur":1,"text":"like that at Manchester United."},"2458":{"dur":1,"text":"So I did some heat\nmaps for

pass\nthe ball over there,"},"2466":{"dur":3,"text":"because that's the\nstructure that van Gaal has."},"2469":{"dur":3,"text":"So you definitely see changes\nin where they're allowed to do,"},"2472":{"dur":1,"text":"and those tend to\nbe instructions"},"2474":{"dur":1,"text":"that come from the manager."},"2475":{"dur":2,"text":"I think, rather than them\nbeing confined to not being"},"2478":{"dur":1,"text":"able to play in the same way."},"2480":{"dur":0,"text":"AUDIENCE: OK."},"2482":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: Well, I\nwill ask one more."},"2484":{"dur":3,"text":"The

have to get into this."},"2513":{"dur":2,"text":"And then it said, you\nknow, the youth team coach"},"2515":{"dur":2,"text":"wants to know this."},"2517":{"dur":3,"text":"It was like running\na real foot-- I mean,"},"2520":{"dur":2,"text":"yeah if you played it, it was\nlike running a football team."},"2523":{"dur":3,"text":"Which is brilliant, but, you\nknow, I have a full-time

time"},"2531":{"dur":1,"text":"to really sit down and play it."},"2533":{"dur":2,"text":"But it looks very realistic."},"2535":{"dur":1,"text":"And I know-- yeah, I\nmean to answer-- well,"},"2537":{"dur":2,"text":"that wasn't your question, but\none really interesting thing"},"2539":{"dur":2,"text":"about \"Football Manager\"\nis that it was bought up"},"2541":{"dur":2,"text":"by Prozone or their\nscouting system"},"2544":{"dur":5,"text":"because they send\npeople out to collect"},"2550":{"dur":1,"text":"in all this information."},"2551":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you look at the\nLiverpool under-15s team,"},"2553":{"dur":2,"text":"it is the Liverpool\nunder-15s team."},"2556":{"dur":2,"text":"They've collected them in\nand somebody-- some amateurs"},"2558":{"dur":1,"text":"have gone and watched the teams."},"2560":{"dur":3,"text":"There's an incredible data\ncollection network that"},"2563":{"dur":1,"text":"is inside \"Football

years,"},"2589":{"dur":1,"text":"but there still is."},"2590":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's not actually\na really solid explanation"},"2594":{"dur":3,"text":"One of it is pitch size,\nfor example, if you"},"2598":{"dur":1,"text":"train on a certain pitch."},"2599":{"dur":3,"text":"There was this lovely thing\nwhere Real Madrid went"},"2602":{"dur":1,"text":"through in the\nChampions League-- I"},"2604":{"dur":3,"text":"can't remember who they had,\nbut they were two-nil down."},"2607":{"dur":1,"text":"It was Wolfsburg I think."},"2608":{"dur":2,"text":"They were two-nil\ndown on

wider in square meters."},"2620":{"dur":2,"text":"And then they won three-nil\non the return visit."},"2622":{"dur":4,"text":"So you can make those small\nadjustments to your tactics"},"2626":{"dur":1,"text":"based on the pitch you play in."},"2628":{"dur":0,"text":"And, yeah."},"2632":{"dur":4,"text":"AUDIENCE: So you coach your\nson's football team, I believe."},"2637":{"dur":3,"text":"Has any of your research made\nit into the tactics used there?"},"2640":{"dur":0,"text":"DAVID SUMPTER: Yeah."},"2641":{"dur":1,"text":"It has to some degree."},"2642":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, we're a bunch of\ndads who do the coaching,"},"2645":{"dur":1,"text":"and so I'm not the only one."},"2646":{"dur":3,"text":"And they kind of-- but I do the\npassing network stuff, and any"},"2650":{"dur":1,"text":"of you who coach kids\nteams or anything,"},"2652":{"dur":1,"text":"you just need a piece of\npaper with a formation"},"2654":{"dur":2,"text":"of the team written\non it and you can just"},"2656":{"dur":1,"text":"draw a line between\nall the players"},"2658":{"dur":1,"text":"who are passing each

matches"},"2665":{"dur":1,"text":"and then I show it to them."},"2667":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, OK, they're only 9 or\n10, but they really love it."},"2670":{"dur":4,"text":"And we do things like instead\nof who scored the most goals,"},"2675":{"dur":3,"text":"it's like which pair of players\nmade the most successful passes"},"2678":{"dur":1,"text":"between the two of

to boast,\nbut we're actually"},"2685":{"dur":2,"text":"a very successful team."},"2687":{"dur":5,"text":"And we won the district\nchampionships last year."},"2693":{"dur":3,"text":"So and that's-- I don't think\nthat's down to my soccermatical"},"2697":{"dur":3,"text":"skills, but it's a lot of\nfun to try and put that stuff"},"2701":{"dur":2,"text":"into the game."},"2711":{"dur":0,"text":"Thanks."},"2712":{"dur":1,"text":"So tournaments\nlike the FA Cup are"},"2714":{"dur":3,"text":"known for being very surprising\nand having a lot of shocks."},"2717":{"dur":3,"text":"How much of that do you think\nis because premiership teams"},"2720":{"dur":1,"text":"are playing lower\nleague teams who"},"2722":{"dur":3,"text":"have like

predict?"},"2732":{"dur":1,"text":"DAVID SUMPTER: Yeah."},"2733":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of it is going to be\ndown to that sort of thing."},"2736":{"dur":2,"text":"But the thing you have\nto start off remembering"},"2738":{"dur":2,"text":"is that 2\/3 of\neverything that happens"},"2740":{"dur":3,"text":"in a football match is\nrandom in the outcome and 1\/3"},"2743":{"dur":0,"text":"is down to
