business."},"77":{"dur":4,"text":"As you can imagine it took a long time and\na lot of rats to figure out how to do this,"},"81":{"dur":4,"text":"but eventually she got to a point where she\ncould get about 150 sensors into a rat's cranium."},"86":{"dur":1,"text":"And she would do the same thing with every\nsingle rat."},"88":{"dur":2,"text":"After the surgery she would take them and\nput them in the world's simplest maze."},"91":{"dur":2,"text":"This maze works the same way every single\ntime."},"93":{"dur":4,"text":"There's a click, the partition moves and the\nfat is free to move up and down."},"97":{"dur":4,"text":"Now if anyone has ever done this with a rat,\nwhat you know is when you drop a rat in a"},"101":{"dur":3,"text":"maze like this it looks like the world's

work."},"265":{"dur":4,"text":"That's how we influence how people behave\non the most automatic, almost subconscious"},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"level."},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"Just to give you an

they took one group and told them to choose\na cue, like go running at the same time everyday"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"or always put your clothes next to your bed."},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"And they told them when they got home from\nworking out they should eat a small piece"},"287":{"dur":4,"text":"of chocolate, which of course is counterintuitive\nbecause we all exercise to lose weight, not"},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"to eat chocolate."},"292":{"dur":4,"text":"But what they found -- and the reason why\nthey found this is that people who did this"},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"exercised twice as much habitually as other\npeople, and the reason why is because you"},"300":{"dur":5,"text":"might think that you want to exercise, but\nyour brain thinks that you are a dirty

out the molecules,\nthe scent molecules, and as it evaporates"},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"the scent will essentially disappear."},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"This was a huge deal for Procter & Gamble\nbecause for years consumers were saying they"},"369":{"dur":4,"text":"wanted some product that would not just mask\nbad smells, but make them disappear."},"373":{"dur":4,"text":"So this guy goes to his boss and says, \"I\nthink I can make this into a product,\" and"},"377":{"dur":4,"text":"they give him seven and a half million dollars\nand three years later he comes up with Febreze,"},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"this product that they're going to sell."},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"The executives turn around and say we need\nto give this to one of our marketing teams"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"because we think we can make a gazillion dollars\noff of this."},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"So they give it to this guy named Drake Stimson,\na mathematician on Wall
