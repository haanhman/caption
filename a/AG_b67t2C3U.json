that's what we're\ngoing to talk about"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"today with the agave."},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"But there are at least a dozen\nplants widely used around

this."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"This is what plants are doing."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"They're taking sunlight, carbon\ndioxide, and water."},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"And they're doing two

that?"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"It's probably doing that as\na bribe, so that a bird or"},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"someone will want to eat it, and\nhelp move the seed around."},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"Sometimes they're storing\nit in the roots,"},"511":{"dur":0,"text":"like potatoes do."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"They put the sugar in the\ntubers, because that's

and"},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"put it in the ground."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's enough sucrose\nin the stalk to support"},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"life for the plant."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"And it'll root, and put\nup leaves if the"},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"conditions are right."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"And then of course grains\nare nothing but seeds."},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"Plants take sugar and\nturn it into starch,"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"and put it into grains."},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"So that when the little seedling\nstarts to emerge, it"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"has something to eat."},"552":{"dur":5,"text":"Because it's not yet big enough\nto make its own food."},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"In the case of grains, it's\na little bit unusual."},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll just explain quickly\nwhat happens."},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"When it gets wet, when a seed\ngets wet, little enzymes go to"},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"work in the seed, breaking the\nstarch back into sugar."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's called malting\nin the booze world."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you hear about malted\nbarley, that's what it means."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"It means they've gotten it\nwet to force it to start"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"terminating, just like this."},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's how malted\nbarley begins."},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"It just so happens that barley\nhas so many of those enzymes"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"that break starch into sugar\nthat barley is used in"},"588":{"dur":0,"text":"everything."},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"It's used a lot of beers, and a\nlot of whiskeys and vodkas."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"Because once it's done\nconverting its own starch to"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"sugar, it will go to work on\ncorn, and wheat, and rye, and"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"whatever else is in the mash."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's why you always see\nmalted barley in everything."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"It's unusually good at doing\nthat little trick."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"A little bit of chemistry\nas well."},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"And that is this."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"Sorry for all the complicated\nscientific diagrams."},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"But what's happening here when\nwe make alcohol is that we"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"take sugar."},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"And we feed it to yeast."},"621":{"dur":4,"text":"And yeast eat the sugar, and\nexcrete two waste products--"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"carbon dioxide and alcohol."},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's where the\nbubbles come from."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's where the\nbooze comes from."},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a little more complicated\nthan that."},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"But pretty much this is how we\ntake plant sugar and make it"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"into booze."},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"And the yeast that we use\nhas been domesticated."},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"It's probably the oldest\ndomesticated"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"creature on the

cube."},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a lot of other complex\nmolecules in there."},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's other things going\non in that process."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"And agave is particularly\nweird."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'll walk through\nthe process."},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"But with agave, where's\nthe sugar?"},"676":{"dur":5,"text":"The heart of the agave that\nis

these are slow-roasted,\ncaramelized sugars that will"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"then be fermented."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"Once it's fermented,\nit gets distilled."},"697":{"dur":0,"text":"You just heat it up."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"And the steam rises."},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"And it coils and condenses."},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"And you get alcohol."},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"That's the very basic process\nfor most booze, agave being a"},"706":{"dur":0,"text":"little different."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what we'll\ndo today."},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"But the stills can be anything\nfrom a very simple thing like"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"I just showed you\na picture of."},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"These are a little more\ncomplex and high tech."},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the Saint George\ndistillery in Alameda, and"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"obviously a little bit\nmore complicated"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"equipment to make vodka."},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"But at its

like."},"738":{"dur":4,"text":"And the clear neutral spirits\nare often distilled to a very"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"high proof and then\nwatered back down."},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"So vodka might be sold\nas 40% alcohol."},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"But it would have been distilled\nto 80%, maybe 90%,"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"and then watered back down."},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"Whiskeys and some of
