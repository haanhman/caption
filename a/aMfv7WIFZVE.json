I think it is"},"395":{"dur":4,"text":"worth remembering the very high public esteem\nthat the National Health Service continues"},"400":{"dur":6,"text":"to be held in. The best way of measuring this\nis the British Social Attitudes survey, going"},"406":{"dur":5,"text":"back decades, it found that in the past year\nthat we are here to talk about actually the"},"411":{"dur":5,"text":"net satisfaction with the National Health\nService is the highest it has been in all"},"416":{"dur":6,"text":"but three of the past 30 years.

We\ntook the opportunity as the NHS leadership"},"437":{"dur":7,"text":"in March, at the end of the year we are giving\naccount for to set the direction for the next"},"444":{"dur":7,"text":"couple of years. We choose the imaginatively\ntitled Next Steps on the Five Year Forward"},"451":{"dur":6,"text":"View, to set out what that needs to comprise.\nGiven all of the pressures and all of the"},"457":{"dur":6,"text":"debates, we felt it was very important to\nfocus on a smaller number of key national"},"464":{"dur":6,"text":"priorities that we would help contribute to\ndriving over the course of the next 12\u201124"},"470":{"dur":8,"text":"months.

The critical responsibility that"},"505":{"dur":6,"text":"we at NHS England have for primary care services,\nfor GP services. The clear improvements you"},"511":{"dur":5,"text":"will hear about in the panel in a moment around\ncancer and mental health services, all within"},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"a difficult financial environment that Paul\nis going to describe. But recognising that"},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"just doing more of the same is no longer going\nto work and therefore really the kind of essence"},"526":{"dur":5,"text":"of Expo is about doing things differently\nand better and so accelerating local service"},"531":{"dur":7,"text":"redesign is essential for that. Let me pick\nout a few of those briefly, because I will"},"539":{"dur":10,"text":"have the opportunity to talk more tomorrow.\nOn primary care let's not forget that each"},"550":{"dur":5,"text":"year, including the year we are reporting\non 16\/17, about 300 million times patients"},"556":{"dur":5,"text":"have visited their GP surgery over the course\nof the last year. That compares with about"},"561":{"dur":5,"text":"23 million visits to A&E departments and other\nparts of the system. What happens in primary"},"567":{"dur":7,"text":"care is really crucially important for the\nNHS as a whole. And yet, if you look back"},"574":{"dur":6,"text":"a few years you see that we have not actually\nacted on that insight. If you see what has"},"581":{"dur":7,"text":"happened to the growth in GP numbers, for\nexample, you can see that compared to the,"},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"quite substantial expansion that there have\nbeen in hospital consultants, actually GP"},"592":{"dur":7,"text":"numbers have been falling. That is why NHS\nEngland explicitly with the BMA, with The"},"600":{"dur":5,"text":"Royal College of GPs, are now embarked on\na programme to both increase investment and"},"606":{"dur":5,"text":"reform the way in which primary care services\noperate. I think it is a source of modest"},"611":{"dur":8,"text":"pride in each of the years prior to NHS England,\nGP spending was going down and now we have"},"620":{"dur":7,"text":"put a clear kink in the curve and in the early\nstages of a significant shift in the resourcing"},"627":{"dur":7,"text":"and the design of primary care services. What\ndoes that mean for the public? One of the"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"most obvious expressions of that will be we\nwant to make it easier for people who need"},"639":{"dur":6,"text":"a GP appointment to get one. And that experience\nhas actually been worsening in recent years,"},"646":{"dur":7,"text":"hardly surprising given the position we have\nset out. Instead, therefore, the rollout of"},"653":{"dur":8,"text":"easier booking, organised on hub basis, populations,\n30,000\u201150,000 and if you run into a GP or"},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"leader from Greater Manchester while you are\nhere at Expo, ask about the action they have"},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"already taken, this is not a plan for the\nnever, never, it is happening across Greater"},"671":{"dur":5,"text":"Manchester now, it is happening across London\nnow, and you will see it rolling out across"},"677":{"dur":6,"text":"the whole of the country over the next 18\nmonths. We are going to hear in one of the"},"683":{"dur":5,"text":"panels, I think, about cancer and mental health\nservices. I won't steal the thunder there"},"688":{"dur":6,"text":"other than to say that in the case of cancer\nservices for example, we know that we need"},"695":{"dur":6,"text":"big infrastructure investments in radiotherapy,\nwhich along with modern cancer drugs and cancer"},"701":{"dur":6,"text":"surgery is one of the three main ways in which\npeople with cancer get properly looked after."},"707":{"dur":7,"text":"And it is a source of pride that we have now\nkicked off the biggest upgrade in radiotherapy"},"715":{"dur":4,"text":"LINACs that we have seen in over 15 years,\nyou only have to go as far as the Christie"},"720":{"dur":5,"text":"Hospital here in Manchester to see the impact\nof that, and that is happening right across"},"726":{"dur":7,"text":"England. On mental health services, sometimes\nwhen you are in the middle of something you"},"733":{"dur":5,"text":"yourself don't see it, it takes the opportunity\nto be seen as others see you, holding a mirror"},"739":{"dur":4,"text":"up to understand what is really going on.\nI was struck by this headline in the New York"},"743":{"dur":6,"text":"Times at the end of July, commenting on the\nwork now to implement the mental health task"},"749":{"dur":5,"text":"force describing England as being in the middle\nof a unique national experiment, the world's"},"754":{"dur":4,"text":"most ambitious efforts to treat depression,\nanxiety and other common mental illnesses."},"759":{"dur":6,"text":"That is only some of what you will hear from\nClaire Murdoch and others, more in a moment"},"765":{"dur":9,"text":"on that. We know that as we embark on these\nchanges we have got to have consistency of"},"774":{"dur":5,"text":"offer in many of these areas, but we have\nalso got to recognise the diversity that this"},"779":{"dur":6,"text":"country represents. And so we make no apologies\nfor the fact that we are deliberately trying"},"786":{"dur":6,"text":"to focus more on improvement and outcomes\nthan we are on administrative structures."},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"We make no apologies for the fact that in\ndevising the big improvement blueprints for"},"798":{"dur":5,"text":"mental health service, cancer services and\nGP services, we did so with patient groups"},"803":{"dur":6,"text":"and professional groups rather than by ourselves.\nWe make no apologies for the fact that the"},"810":{"dur":5,"text":"route that Andy Burnham and colleagues, John\nRouse and colleagues here in Manchester will"},"815":{"dur":5,"text":"be different from the route that people in\nSurrey or Cornwall or other parts of the country"},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"will be choosing, because if you are focused\non outcomes and service improvement rather"},"824":{"dur":5,"text":"than administrative structures then you want\nto back the energy and continuous improvement"},"829":{"dur":6,"text":"wherever you find it. But I think, if Expo\nmeans anything it means a recognition that"},"836":{"dur":5,"text":"simply doing more of the same is increasingly\nunsustainable, offering a difficult environment"},"842":{"dur":6,"text":"for frontline staff and it is increasingly\nchallenging for patients. So, the history"},"849":{"dur":8,"text":"of the NHS, as we will hear tomorrow, is a\nhistory of redesign and innovation and Expo"},"857":{"dur":5,"text":"is all about putting fuel in that tank. We\nsee already that where different parts of"},"863":{"dur":5,"text":"the country are redesigning services they\nare not only improving the quality of care,"},"868":{"dur":5,"text":"but they are relieving the pressure on other\nparts of the system. So one of the things"},"873":{"dur":5,"text":"we were particularly pleased to be able to\nshow during the course of last year was that"},"879":{"dur":5,"text":"the vanguards, the parts of the country that\nhave got on with integrating the way their"},"884":{"dur":4,"text":"primary and community and social care and\nhospital services work, those parts of the"},"889":{"dur":5,"text":"country are seeing lower rates of emergency\nhospitalisation which is part of the answer"},"894":{"dur":4,"text":"to the winter pressures which rightly the\nwhole of the National Health Service is focused"},"899":{"dur":6,"text":"on. So I hope that gives you a flavour, not\nonly of some of the energy and effort that"},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"has gone on over the course of last year,\nand Paul will describe more, but also the"},"909":{"dur":5,"text":"agenda we have set ourselves for the year\nahead. That is the agenda that the panels"},"914":{"dur":4,"text":"will now talk with you about, and we will\nhave a chance to discuss more during Q&A."},"919":{"dur":7,"text":"Thank you very much.

So this is our panel, which is\ngoing to be discussing what NHS England is"},"943":{"dur":5,"text":"doing and its work with its partners and stakeholders\nto deliver more responsive, more joined up"},"948":{"dur":5,"text":"care.

They are all in different places,\nthey reflect their history, there is still"},"1008":{"dur":8,"text":"a range between our most advanced STPs where\nthey are working very closely as health systems,"},"1016":{"dur":3,"text":"they are working very closely with local Government,\nthey are working very closely with the voluntary"},"1020":{"dur":4,"text":"sector, and others where they are still on\na journey and building those relationships,"},"1025":{"dur":5,"text":"we have places where the local authorities\nare in the lead such as Nottingham and Surrey"},"1031":{"dur":3,"text":"where the Chief Executive or deputy Chief\nExecutives of STPs are actually leading the"},"1035":{"dur":9,"text":"work. But wherever you go we are seeing an\napproach developing which is saying there"},"1044":{"dur":5,"text":"is a complexity to the challenge that the\nNHS faces now that you can't work in silos"},"1050":{"dur":6,"text":"to solve this, we need to see partnerships\ndeveloping across acute and community and"},"1056":{"dur":5,"text":"primary care, across the NHS sector and the\nsocial care sector, closer engagement with"},"1061":{"dur":5,"text":"the voluntary sector, because the challenges\nare hard, because demand is high, because"},"1067":{"dur":6,"text":"patient and public needs are high. To do the\nsystem shift that we want to get the right"},"1074":{"dur":8,"text":"patients, the right care, in the right place,\nthat needs team work, it requires a consolidated"},"1082":{"dur":5,"text":"effort. So if we think as The Royal College\nof GPs says, that 27% of the patients that"},"1087":{"dur":6,"text":"go and see a GP could have cared for themselves,\nand if we think as our studies show that about"},"1093":{"dur":5,"text":"a quarter of the patients that go to an A&E\ncould have been treated by a GP, but our GPs"},"1099":{"dur":5,"text":"are busy and full and our hospitals are busy\nand full, if you don't do that work together,"},"1105":{"dur":7,"text":"you can't do the shift. And we are seeing\nincreasingly that the attitude that was expressed"},"1112":{"dur":6,"text":"over a year ago by a teaching hospital Chief\nExecutive in London, that they enjoyed patients"},"1118":{"dur":4,"text":"who didn't really need to be in the A&E coming\nto A&E because they made money on every case,"},"1123":{"dur":6,"text":"that is now treated as outdated and outmoded.\nThat is not the way that the NHS thinks any"},"1130":{"dur":6,"text":"more.

In order to deliver what we\nreally want to deliver around improving care"},"1372":{"dur":6,"text":"for people with Learning Disability we had\nto do that in partnership, so we set up transforming"},"1378":{"dur":5,"text":"care partnerships in advance of the STPs and\nthat was really bringing together commissioners,"},"1384":{"dur":5,"text":"providers, people with learning disability\nand their families, to really determine what"},"1389":{"dur":5,"text":"that care should look like.

It"},"1422":{"dur":5,"text":"is not about organisations or individual organisational\nresponsibility, it is about keeping in mind"},"1428":{"dur":4,"text":"what the end game is and what we are really\ntrying to deliver.
