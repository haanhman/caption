of the first collaborations\nor collaborators I seeked was Akram Khan."},"1221":{"dur":3,"text":"He came and created\n'Dust' for us as part of the"},"1224":{"dur":3,"text":"anniversary programme of World War I"},"1228":{"dur":4,"text":"and, again, he will be\ncreating 'Giselle' for us."},"1232":{"dur":2,"text":"And the idea behind specifically 'Giselle'"},"1235":{"dur":4,"text":"was that this is a very traditional\npart of the classical repertoire"},"1240":{"dur":2,"text":"and I wanted a different\ncultural perspective,"},"1243":{"dur":3,"text":"a different angle into something\nthat is perceived as very traditional."},"1247":{"dur":4,"text":"And the idea behind that was\nboth to include this cultural perspective,"},"1253":{"dur":4,"text":"to allow our traditional audiences\nto feel confident enough with the work"},"1258":{"dur":2,"text":"that they will be willing to come"},"1260":{"dur":3,"text":"to a programme by an Asian choreographer"},"1263":{"dur":4,"text":"even by mixing

working."},"1292":{"dur":4,"text":"It's been incredibly\nsuccessful artistically,"},"1297":{"dur":2,"text":"but also from all the\nother points of views."},"1301":{"dur":5,"text":"It's something, as

want is this piece of work."},"1315":{"dur":2,"text":"It opened, as well, Glastonbury for us."},"1317":{"dur":3,"text":"We performed in front of people\nthat had never gone to the ballet"},"1321":{"dur":7,"text":"and in a very different ambience\noutside of a traditional theatre"},"1329":{"dur":4,"text":"and it was quite overwhelming\nfor both the audience and ourselves."},"1335":{"dur":5,"text":"Then, of course, another angle\nis we are a touring company"},"1341":{"dur":3,"text":"and so far all of this work\nhas been focussed in London."},"1344":{"dur":5,"text":"We felt that challenging our\naudiences was easier in London,"},"1350":{"dur":4,"text":"but is something that now we're confident\nenough that, because of its success,"},"1355":{"dur":3,"text":"we're actually now\nbringing it to all our touring,"},"1358":{"dur":4,"text":"or to some of our touring locations."},"1363":{"dur":1,"text":"Because I do want

that's one of the specific projects."},"1374":{"dur":4,"text":"Another part of our work is our reach"},"1378":{"dur":3,"text":"and we reach about 48,000 people a year."},"1383":{"dur":2,"text":"Many

Europe."},"1423":{"dur":5,"text":"So, I think that's again\nsomething I'm very proud [of]."},"1429":{"dur":3,"text":"It is also, as I said, everyday decisions."},"1433":{"dur":2,"text":"Our ticket prices start at \u00a312,"},"1436":{"dur":4,"text":"because traditionally the perception\nis that we're an expensive"},"1441":{"dur":2,"text":"art form for very few."},"1444":{"dur":3,"text":"And we see that by making it accessible"},"1447":{"dur":3,"text":"hopefully our audiences\nwill become more varied."},"1453":{"dur":5,"text":"Through our choreographic workshops\nwe try to encourage female

you,"},"1518":{"dur":5,"text":"as you've said, I mean ballet in particular\nhas this white male canon"},"1525":{"dur":5,"text":"that many of your core audience, I imagine,\nare quite attached to and expect to see."},"1531":{"dur":1,"text":"So, how do you overcome that problem?"},"1533":{"dur":2,"text":"TAMARA ROJO: By challenging that,\nby changing it"},"1536":{"dur":2,"text":"and by creating different\nrole models as well."},"1538":{"dur":5,"text":"I mean, ourselves as an organisation,\nwe are an all-female leading team."},"1544":{"dur":2,"text":"The Executive Director,\nthe Artistic

-"},"1561":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that they're a lot more\nopen-minded than you think."},"1563":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, we have\n22 nationalities in our dancers."},"1568":{"dur":2,"text":"For the first time, we hired out the\nAlbert Hall with 5,000 people;"},"1571":{"dur":4,"text":"all three leading roles of\n'Rome and Juliet' were by black men."},"1576":{"dur":1,"text":"The opening night at

ballet."},"1593":{"dur":3,"text":"So, as I said, it is about\neveryday decisions,"},"1597":{"dur":2,"text":"not just about specific projects,"},"1600":{"dur":3,"text":"to be able to change\nthe audience's perception"},"1603":{"dur":3,"text":"and even the practicer's\nperception as well."},"1607":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of those choreographers were surprised\nthe first time that I said"},"1610":{"dur":2,"text":"'This is your corps de ballet and\nthis is who you have to work with.'"},"1613":{"dur":4,"text":"And they never, maybe, considered that\npossibility of having black snowflakes,"},"1618":{"dur":4,"text":"but there they are and they're\nwonderful and no one now questions it."},"1622":{"dur":2,"text":"So, as soon as we normalise it"},"1624":{"dur":3,"text":"and we provide those role models\nfor those children that we work with"},"1628":{"dur":1,"text":"and they realise that is possible,"},"1630":{"dur":4,"text":"that you can have a space in an art form\nthat maybe you thought wasn't open to you."},"1635":{"dur":3,"text":"I do hope that, as you say,\nthey start in the audience,"},"1638":{"dur":1,"text":"they become practitioners"},"1640":{"dur":2,"text":"and one day they will become leaders too."},"1642":{"dur":2,"text":"KIRSTY LANG: Tamara, thank you very much.\nI'm conscious of

lies"},"1687":{"dur":4,"text":"and in its name itself it talks\nabout exchanging art in new ways."},"1692":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we're about refreshing and re-thinking\nhow the arts ecology works"},"1697":{"dur":4,"text":"and re-thinking who curates,\nwho makes, who consumes art"},"1701":{"dur":2,"text":"and always constantly re-thinking this."},"1704":{"dur":4,"text":"So, for us, collaboration\nand reaching communities"},"1709":{"dur":2,"text":"becomes a really important\npart of our work."},"1712":{"dur":4,"text":"Our mission is very much about\nstimulating new perspectives about"},"1717":{"dur":3,"text":"the value of diversity and we\ntalk about the value of art and culture"},"1721":{"dur":1,"text":"in a big way today."},"1722":{"dur":3,"text":"And we look at valuing what\ndiversity means in both art and society"},"1726":{"dur":2,"text":"and how society influences art\nand vice versa"},"1729":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of the narratives\nthat come out of our space."},"1732":{"dur":5,"text":"We put on exhibitions, we commission,\nwe take on touring work as well."},"1738":{"dur":3,"text":"We have our own theatre group called YARD,"},"1741":{"dur":2,"text":"which is about the next\ngeneration of leaders."},"1745":{"dur":5,"text":"And the creative case, for us,\nis something that is like oxygen for us."},"1750":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it's something that we\nbreathe and do every day"},"1754":{"dur":2,"text":"and we have been doing\nthis for 20-odd years"},"1756":{"dur":3,"text":"and as a new venue over\nsix years as New Art Exchange,"},"1760":{"dur":1,"text":"there's been much progress."},"1762":{"dur":3,"text":"And a lot of that progress is\nvery much down to collaboration."},"1766":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the collaboration\nI'd like to talk about,"},"1770":{"dur":2,"text":"one that we're doing at the moment,\nthere's many to talk about,"},"1772":{"dur":2,"text":"but there's one in\nparticular at the moment."},"1774":{"dur":3,"text":"Is where we're working with\na museum called Galleries of Justice,"},"1778":{"dur":3,"text":"which is based in the\ncity centre of Nottingham."},"1781":{"dur":6,"text":"It's very much a space which looks at the\nEnglish history around the justice system."},"1788":{"dur":5,"text":"And the opportunity they have\nis to engage a wider demographic"},"1794":{"dur":3,"text":"and they're not reaching black\nminority ethnic groups at the moment."},"1798":{"dur":3,"text":"So the New Art Exchange team has"},"1801":{"dur":5,"text":"teamed up with them on a senior level with\ntheir, sort of, leadership management group,"},"1807":{"dur":3,"text":"with the chief 'execs and the\ncreative teams coming together,"},"1811":{"dur":4,"text":"to devise a programme\nwhich works with a creative team"},"1815":{"dur":2,"text":"from the community itself\nand engaging the community."},"1818":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the project is very much about\nhow do you transform a space,"},"1824":{"dur":1,"text":"like Galleries of Justice,"},"1825":{"dur":6,"text":"by exploring the histories of black minority\nethnic groups in a space like Nottingham."},"1832":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we're looking at\nthe topic of civil rights"},"1836":{"dur":4,"text":"and we've got a catchy, catchy, catchy\nname called 'Get Up, Stand Up.'"},"1841":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this is going to be looking\nat the expression of communities."},"1845":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you think about the model\nthat we're trying to instigate here,"},"1849":{"dur":3,"text":"it's looking at the leadership\nwithin the museum"},"1852":{"dur":4,"text":"and trying to transfer and\nlearn what their context is"},"1857":{"dur":2,"text":"and what our context is\naround thought-leadership,"},"1860":{"dur":2,"text":"around policy shift, about decisions"},"1862":{"dur":4,"text":"and how they're made and\nalso about how a creative product"},"1866":{"dur":4,"text":"can emerge from this project\nthat's going to be of meaning"},"1871":{"dur":2,"text":"and give significance to the communities,"},"1874":{"dur":2,"text":"so they feel that they have\nan ownership of the space."},"1878":{"dur":3,"text":"So, 'Get Up, Stand Up' is something\nthat's going to be launching in March."},"1882":{"dur":2,"text":"It'll be an installation piece,"},"1884":{"dur":3,"text":"so it'll be looking at\naudio-visual technology"},"1888":{"dur":5,"text":"and it will aim to provide a space\nwhere people can share their histories"},"1894":{"dur":1,"text":"and exchange and learn."},"1897":{"dur":4,"text":"I always think that the work we do\nis about reaching communities"},"1902":{"dur":4,"text":"and one of the thoughts\nthat I was having before this session was"},"1907":{"dur":4,"text":"'Is it impossible or is it possible to reach\nevery possible community out there?'"},"1915":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, I had a challenge\nwhen I first started."},"1920":{"dur":4,"text":"I came to the venue and\nopposite the venue is a mosque"},"1924":{"dur":3,"text":"and every Friday there is a\ncongregation that comes in

clear."},"1945":{"dur":2,"text":"They see you as the tavern\nand them the temple.'"},"1949":{"dur":2,"text":"I said 'That's interesting.'"},"1951":{"dur":2,"text":"' Probably the case, because we have a bar,"},"1954":{"dur":3,"text":"we have a lot of noise on\nFriday nights in particular"},"1959":{"dur":4,"text":"and a lot of different types\nof cultures coming together."},"1964":{"dur":6,"text":"And so, I challenged him when he said this,\nI said 'Well, how do we crack the code?'"},"1970":{"dur":5,"text":"And he said 'Look, give me four weeks\nand I'll have an answer for you.'"},"1976":{"dur":1,"text":"I said 'Fine.' So, he got to work."},"1977":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said he would call me from the\nreception phone which he never calls from"},"1981":{"dur":2,"text":"and I had a basement office at the time."},"1984":{"dur":4,"text":"And, lo and behold, four weeks later\nI get this phone call from the receptionist"},"1988":{"dur":2,"text":"and she says\n'Tasawar would like to speak to you.'"},"1991":{"dur":3,"text":"And I thought 'Ok, he's cracked the code.\nHere we go.'"},"1994":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I ran upstairs.\nI didn't even answer the phone"},"1997":{"dur":4,"text":"and, lo and behold, the whole\ngallery was full of the congregation"},"2002":{"dur":2,"text":"of Muslim men who'd just done their prayers"},"2005":{"dur":4,"text":"and I was wondering\n'So what's the story here?'"},"2009":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, the story was,\nthere was several elements to his success."},"2015":{"dur":3,"text":"The key thing was that\nhe made the effort to cross the road"},"2019":{"dur":1,"text":"and pray with the congregation."},"2021":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, being of Muslim origin himself"},"2023":{"dur":2,"text":"he was able to do this\nmore easily than myself"},"2026":{"dur":1,"text":"and so he entered the space"},"2027":{"dur":2,"text":"on a very spiritual and\npersonal level with the community,"},"2030":{"dur":2,"text":"built the relationship with the community,"},"2033":{"dur":4,"text":"but on top of that, he'd created\na very interesting installation."},"2038":{"dur":4,"text":"And the installation was looking\nat the visualisation of the Qur'an,"},"2042":{"dur":1,"text":"which had never been done before."},"2044":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this was the visualisation\nof the Qur'an using data-mapping software,"},"2047":{"dur":2,"text":"data-mapping techniques and artists"},"2050":{"dur":5,"text":"to create this amazing swirling, whirling,\nsort of word map of the Qur'an."},"2058":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can imagine the word\nin the middle would be 'Allah',"},"2061":{"dur":5,"text":"because it's the most repetitive\nword in the Qur'an in that sense."},"2067":{"dur":3,"text":"It was juxtaposed with\na very interesting aesthetic"},"2071":{"dur":5,"text":"around Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's voice\nand it was a visualisation of the Qawwali,"},"2076":{"dur":2,"text":"where he'd worked with\nscientists from Jodrell Bank"},"2079":{"dur":4,"text":"to create this visualisation\nof a Qawwali Sufi singer"},"2084":{"dur":4,"text":"and having a conversation and dialogue\nwith the visualisation of the Qur'an."},"2089":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, this was very literal for the\ncommunity and it engaged and connected."},"2093":{"dur":5,"text":"But creatively also, aesthetically,\nit was a very challenging piece"},"2099":{"dur":2,"text":"and, of course, it could be contentious."},"2102":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it was bringing the congregation in,"},"2104":{"dur":3,"text":"easing the relationship first\nbefore they entered the space"},"2108":{"dur":1,"text":"for them to then connect\nand have dialogue."},"2110":{"dur":2,"text":"KIRSTY LANG: And then how do you keep\nthem coming back?
