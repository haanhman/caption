the penalties."},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"So the Justice Department\nlooked and noticed"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"that the fines were pretty low."},"620":{"dur":5,"text":"So the fines were raised from\n10 million to 100 million."},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"And then they looked\nabout jail time,"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"and they noticed\nthat they weren't"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"sending very many
