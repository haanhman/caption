when"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"spinal fluid can go up into and surround the\nbrain area but not come back down"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"and so that\u2019s a very common condition with\nSpina

one is a simple partial seizure"},"806":{"dur":5,"text":"they have a sudden jerking motion perhaps\nin their arm or their leg"},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"they don\u2019t lose consciousness"},"814":{"dur":4,"text":"but they might have unusual smells or they,\nyou know they might smell things unusually"},"819":{"dur":5,"text":"or taste things in their mouth or have
