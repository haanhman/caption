years ago."},"147":{"dur":5,"text":"And so we knew that we wanted to have an exhibition\nfocused around the German painting collection"},"152":{"dur":1,"text":"here."},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"And the question was really then what to do\nwith the collection that hadn't been done"},"157":{"dur":1,"text":"before."},"158":{"dur":5,"text":"So the idea was to think about a new kind\nof story that we could tell to the public."},"164":{"dur":6,"text":"And part of the idea behind it, I have to\nsay, was also inspired by research work that"},"170":{"dur":4,"text":"was done by another curator here at The National\nGallery, Susanna Avery-Quash."},"175":{"dur":4,"text":"So as it happened, when I came down from York\nto meet with Susan, to talk about the exhibition"},"179":{"dur":4,"text":"for the

saw what is now considered one of the"},"200":{"dur":4,"text":"most important German Renaissance paintings,\nwhich is the Isenheim Altarpiece by Gr\u0178newald,"},"205":{"dur":4,"text":"and we have one drawing by Gr\u0178newald in our\nexhibition."},"209":{"dur":6,"text":"And Eastlake described this painting as repulsive\nand disgusting."},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"And I thought that was so fascinating."},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean not just that he had that very negative\nreaction to a painting that we now consider"},"222":{"dur":4,"text":"to be really one of the great masterpieces,\nbut also just the fact that he expressed it"},"226":{"dur":1,"text":"in such a direct way."},"228":{"dur":3,"text":"And we started to think, actually, wouldn't\nit be interesting to think about the history"},"232":{"dur":4,"text":"of how people have responded to these German\npaintings?"},"236":{"dur":6,"text":"But then also, really partly inspired by that\novert commentary that

express their\nown opinion."},"249":{"dur":6,"text":"Yes, absolutely, and that was something that\nwe hadn't done here before in an exhibition,"},"255":{"dur":3,"text":"so it's an experiment for us."},"259":{"dur":7,"text":"I mean, we can show you the exhibition plan,\nso if you haven't been there before..."},"266":{"dur":6,"text":"Room Six up there is our comment room, so\nif you're going to

comments."},"280":{"dur":3,"text":"Most people, I think, don't agree with Charles\nEastlake, but..."},"284":{"dur":4,"text":"Although, if anyone does, you're more than\nwelcome to say so."},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"Yes, so the exhibition has..."},"291":{"dur":4,"text":"I would say that there are three different,\ninterlocking themes that run through it."},"296":{"dur":6,"text":"So one of them is giving some of a taste of,\nparticularly the 19th Century context, of"},"302":{"dur":5,"text":"what the tastes were when this collection\nwas founded, the kinds of artworks that people"},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"admired in the 19th and early 20th Century."},"311":{"dur":5,"text":"And that's really emphasised, particularly\nin the first room when you go through."},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"And then after giving a bit more of a sense\nof the history of the collection, it then"},"319":{"dur":4,"text":"also particularly starts to examine, what\nare the intrinsic qualities of German Renaissance"},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"art?"},"325":{"dur":5,"text":"What seem to be the features that are admired\nby those artists, in its own time?"},"331":{"dur":4,"text":"And so then that then links into the idea\nof us thinking about, what do we think about"},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"these artworks today?"},"336":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's those three things; the history of\nthe collection, what is the nature of these"},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"artworks that have made them at times admired,\nat times not?"},"343":{"dur":4,"text":"And now we invite the audience to give their\nown response."},"348":{"dur":5,"text":"One of the things that fascinated me, delving\ninto the history of German painting in the"},"353":{"dur":7,"text":"Gallery for this new catalogue was that the\nlast catalogue, really the only comprehensive"},"360":{"dur":6,"text":"catalogue of German paintings, was published\nin 1959 by Michael Levy who subsequently became"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"Director."},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was part of a series of catalogues\npublished then in paperback form."},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"It was quite a slim

at a moment when things were"},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"just about to change."},"389":{"dur":7,"text":"So it seems almost unfortunate that he completed\nit in 1959, because that was an end of a really"},"396":{"dur":6,"text":"very passive moment, I think, in the Gallery's\ncollecting of German painting, that things"},"402":{"dur":4,"text":"had come in, but on the whole the Gallery\nhad not gone out and really sought to acquire"},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"them."},"408":{"dur":5,"text":"And it was after that moment, which now appears\nreally pivotal, looking back, that the Gallery"},"414":{"dur":6,"text":"consciously decided it really needed to go\nout and collect German painting, not just"},"421":{"dur":5,"text":"from the German Renaissance period, which\nour exhibition focuses on, but also from the"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"19th Century as well."},"428":{"dur":4,"text":"So now our collection looks very different,\nand it is indeed time for a new catalogue."},"433":{"dur":5,"text":"But there was that moment in 1959, I think,\nof looking back and perhaps feeling, well,"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"it's done."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"And yet it was all about to start again."},"442":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think Michael Levy was very important\nin changing the culture here, and in seeing"},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"German art as being worthwhile and important."},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"And when you go around the exhibition \u00d0 I\nmean, this is also true of all the paintings"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"that are in the collection \u00d0 you can always\nlook and see what date the paintings were"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"acquired."},"460":{"dur":5,"text":"And I would say really about half of the German\ncollection was acquired from the 1960s onwards"},"466":{"dur":4,"text":"so there's quite a lopsided history; you know,\nthis kind of trickle of works that come in"},"470":{"dur":4,"text":"over many, many decades, and then suddenly\nthis decision is made that we need to build"},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"up the German collection; from the 1960s onwards\nquite a lot more come in."},"478":{"dur":5,"text":"And that meant looking beyond the shores of\nthe United Kingdom too."},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think one of the things that's very\ninteresting, looking at the exhibition, is"},"488":{"dur":5,"text":"when you look at the paintings that were acquired\nin the 19th Century, or the early 20th Century,"},"494":{"dur":5,"text":"you know that the people who consciously acquired\nthem, on the whole, must have done so for"},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"some quite specific reason, quite consciously,\nand that they were certainly in the avant"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"garde of taste, I think, at that time."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"Looking..."},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"Sorry."},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"I was just about to say probably what you\nwere just about to say, was that I think this"},"513":{"dur":4,"text":"first slide that we're showing, this group\nof paintings, is a group of works that are"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"shown in the first room of the exhibition."},"520":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's meant to demonstrate what kind of\npainting was admired at the time that the"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"National Gallery was founded."},"527":{"dur":6,"text":"So we see this emphasis on landscapes, on\nlarge-scale figural paintings of the 16th"},"534":{"dur":5,"text":"and 17th Century, which we see in the work\non the upper right, which is one of the Carracci"},"539":{"dur":4,"text":"paintings here, and then particularly in the\nRaphael painting of Saint Catherine in the"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"lower centre."},"545":{"dur":5,"text":"And then we also have a school of Rembrandt\nwork in the lower left."},"550":{"dur":5,"text":"And then we also discuss in that first room\nhow the kinds of early German paintings that"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"were likely to be admired were ones that didn't\nlook German, so..."},"560":{"dur":5,"text":"There's this accidental German painting, lower\nright, which is a painting by an artist called"},"565":{"dur":6,"text":"Schweichard, which came into the Gallery in\n1852, it was left to the Gallery."},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's an example of a sort of

are"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"exactly in the landscape exactly in the tradition\nof Dutch painting."},"586":{"dur":6,"text":"And in the exhibition we've put it next to\na painting by Potter, and clearly it depends"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"on Potter for this composition."},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"Absolutely."},"596":{"dur":5,"text":"So this is the kind of painting that people\nexpected to see in the 19th Century, at least"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"the kind of circles that were involved in\nthe foundation of the Gallery and in the government"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"and the Trustees and so on."},"608":{"dur":5,"text":"And then another feature that we show in that\nfirst room, in our next slide..."},"613":{"dur":5,"text":"So there's a very deliberate juxtaposition\nthat we've included that faces you as you"},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"walk into that room."},"621":{"dur":5,"text":"And you'll see in front of you this juxtaposition\nof three paintings, and in the centre is a"},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"quintessential German Renaissance painting\nby Hans Baldung Grien, and we have that juxtaposed"},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"to the Raphael on the one side, exemplifying\nreally the artist that was considered the"},"636":{"dur":4,"text":"greatest, most important artist of the Western\ntradition, so much admired."},"640":{"dur":4,"text":"And then on the other side we have the Van\nEyck Arnolfini work which is a type of painting"},"645":{"dur":5,"text":"that had not previously for the last couple\nof centuries been very heavily admired."},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"But it was starting to be admired, that kind\nof painting, and particularly the very delicate,"},"655":{"dur":6,"text":"fine technique of his use of oil paint and\nthat sense of almost looking into a

that"},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"room."},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"Which it really does, yes."},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes."},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you just see the..."},"675":{"dur":5,"text":"In

very"},"685":{"dur":5,"text":"stark emotion that you have; a kind of very\nflat background and the figures kind of projecting"},"691":{"dur":4,"text":"forwards, but not with that kind of delicacy,\nrefinement of technique that you see in the"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"Van Eyck."},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"The application of paint is very different."},"699":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, I remember you coming up with the idea\nof that juxtaposition."},"705":{"dur":5,"text":"Was the Baldung your absolute sort of first\nthought of what German painting people should"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"be confronted with when they came into the\nexhibition?"},"713":{"dur":5,"text":"I think so and the reason is because one of\nthe features that we then go on to talk about"},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"in a subsequent room of the exhibition, the\nthings that characterise German Renaissance"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"painting."},"724":{"dur":5,"text":"One of the most important of them is expression,\nand this very strong emotional impact which"},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"isn't about having a beautiful figure with\na kind of beautiful, delicate expression."},"733":{"dur":7,"text":"It's very much about a very tragic emotion,\nand I think also the sense of... Baldung isn't"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to make his figures live up to a certain\nideal, I think."},"745":{"dur":5,"text":"He's got his own sense of how you make a human\nfigure powerful, and I think that that's really"},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"exemplified in this particular painting, is\nyou have, you know, the body of Christ being"},"755":{"dur":5,"text":"shown and presented to the viewer, and it's\nalmost asking you, the viewer, to respond"},"760":{"dur":5,"text":"to the body of Christ in the same way that\nthe Virgin Mary on one side and John on the"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"other side do."},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"That it's inviting that kind of very powerful\nemotional response which is very different"},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"from, I think, the way that you're expected\nto respond to the Saint Catherine."},"773":{"dur":5,"text":"I mean, she herself is a saint who was tortured,\nbut that's not what you're seeing in this"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"particular painting."},"779":{"dur":5,"text":"You're seeing her in, you know, a very beautiful\ncontrapposto, gazing up into heaven; very"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"different reaction I think."},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"This painting also has an interesting history,\ndoesn't it?"},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"Because we know it was in England in the 18th\nCentury, rather strangely."},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't know how it got here."},"795":{"dur":5,"text":"But we know that the little figures there\nwere actually thought to be English people."},"800":{"dur":4,"text":"They were thought to be members of the Howard\nfamily, the families of the Dukes of Norfolk."},"805":{"dur":5,"text":"So this was the interest of this painting\nfor people in the 18th and 19th Century, that"},"810":{"dur":6,"text":"it represented English history and, you know,\nit wasn't connected to Germany in any way"},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"at all."},"817":{"dur":4,"text":"So maybe that's part of what made it palatable\nat that particular time."},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"It might be just worth saying a word about\nthe way the exhibition's been designed and"},"827":{"dur":8,"text":"presented, because when you walk into the\nfirst room it's set out in such a way that"},"835":{"dur":5,"text":"you feel that you are in the Angerstein Collection,\nbecause there are screens that are taken from"},"841":{"dur":4,"text":"an early watercolour of the founding collection\nof the National Gallery."},"845":{"dur":6,"text":"And we were working with new designers on\nthis exhibition and I think we found it quite"},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"a stimulating experience, didn't we?"},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was completely their idea."},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes."},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"So we had a lot of interesting back-and-forth\nabout how to create the kind of ambience that"},"860":{"dur":5,"text":"we wanted, so we had a sense that we wanted\nthe exhibition to feel bold and fresh and"},"866":{"dur":4,"text":"contemporary, while also giving a bit of a\nsense of the historical context."},"870":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think the use of colours in the different\nrooms is one feature of how that's been played"},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"through."},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"And also that idea of walking through the\nscreens."},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"And can I also just mention..."},"881":{"dur":3,"text":"It's one of those things that I bet most people\ndon't actually see when they go into that"},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"front room."},"886":{"dur":3,"text":"But the screens that you walk through, it's\ngot a projection of a watercolour image on"},"890":{"dur":5,"text":"it, which was made in the 1830s, and it represents\nthe Angerstein Collection before it moved"},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"to this building."},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"And one of the paintings that you can see\nis the Cuyp landscape, which is also actually"},"902":{"dur":1,"text":"on the wall."},"903":{"dur":4,"text":"So when you walk in and kind of look to the\nupper left, you can actually see the representation"},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"of it, and then actually see the painting\non the wall, which is something that we didn't"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"plan, but then it went up and we're like,\noh, how exciting."},"913":{"dur":1,"text":"Serendipity."},"914":{"dur":1,"text":"But I remember you pointing that out, yes."},"915":{"dur":4,"text":"Yes, so you can actually see that connection\nbetween the historical collection and what's"},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"actually in the room around you."},"923":{"dur":6,"text":"So then moving into really the history of\nthe 19th Century and this boldly-coloured"},"929":{"dur":5,"text":"room which then contrasts, really, with the\nrooms in which we move right back to the German"},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"Renaissance itself."},"937":{"dur":7,"text":"And this is a room where we talk about different\ncollectors, but also about different altarpieces."},"945":{"dur":9,"text":"And we're lucky here to be able to put together\nthe Aachen altarpiece which is divided, historically,"},"955":{"dur":5,"text":"between the National Gallery and the Walker\nArt Gallery in Liverpool who own the two shutters"},"960":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can see in this slide."},"963":{"dur":12,"text":"And we just have the central \u00d0 if I can get\nit \u00d0 the central panel, which is there."},"975":{"dur":5,"text":"Paintings which came into this country in\nthe period in which churches in Europe were"},"980":{"dur":6,"text":"being secularised, and this was a great opportunity\nfor those collectors who were interested in"},"987":{"dur":4,"text":"this kind of Gothic, primitive painting, as\nthey saw it."},"992":{"dur":4,"text":"And when I see this I always think of people\nlike Pugin going over in a rowing boat to"},"996":{"dur":6,"text":"the Low Countries in order to snap up paintings\nand sculpture of this time and bring them"},"1002":{"dur":4,"text":"back to the very small number of people in\nthis country who would have been interested"},"1007":{"dur":1,"text":"in them at this time."},"1008":{"dur":8,"text":"And I think also this painting exemplifies\nagain some of the features of German art that,"},"1017":{"dur":4,"text":"to some audiences, were very appealing and\ninteresting, so this attention to detail."},"1021":{"dur":4,"text":"There's so much emphasis on each individual\nfigure and the clothing and the textures of"},"1026":{"dur":1,"text":"the textiles."},"1027":{"dur":6,"text":"But then also the gestures and the complex\nmotion that's taking place within this work."},"1033":{"dur":5,"text":"Now this work, it was given as a gift to the\nNational Gallery in 1847, I think it was,"},"1038":{"dur":5,"text":"so it's actually the first German painting\nof that period that came to the collection."},"1043":{"dur":4,"text":"And the Trustees accepted it, and then they\nimmediately put it in the boardroom and didn't"},"1048":{"dur":1,"text":"show it to anybody."},"1049":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's almost as if they thought, okay, we'll\ntake it for our collection, but do we really"},"1053":{"dur":1,"text":"want people to see it, not sure."},"1055":{"dur":4,"text":"And it actually wasn't until the 1880s that\nthey decided to take it out of storage and"},"1059":{"dur":2,"text":"actually put it on public display."},"1061":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, one of the things that I think must\nhave made it quite offensive to people who"},"1065":{"dur":6,"text":"so much admired the more classical style of\npainting represented by Raphael is the way"},"1072":{"dur":8,"text":"in which there's so much action and it's an\naction which takes place at different times,"},"1080":{"dur":2,"text":"even in the same field of painting."},"1082":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you know, it's unlike classical drama."},"1086":{"dur":4,"text":"Things are going on from different periods\nfrom before the Crucifixion, and then Christ"},"1090":{"dur":2,"text":"being taken down from the cross afterwards."},"1092":{"dur":5,"text":"So it is in that way a very unclassical type\nof painting."},"1097":{"dur":1,"text":"Absolutely."},"1098":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think we also then see in a number of\nthe other works that tend to get acquired"},"1103":{"dur":4,"text":"in the 19th Century, there are a lot of portraits\nthat get bought later on."},"1107":{"dur":5,"text":"And one of the things that we're hoping to\nemphasise in that second room is how a lot"},"1112":{"dur":4,"text":"of the German paintings that came in, particularly\nin the 19th and early 20th Century, came from"},"1117":{"dur":5,"text":"collectors really more than the National Gallery\nmaking a point of going out and acquiring"},"1122":{"dur":1,"text":"works itself."},"1123":{"dur":3,"text":"But when it did acquire works, it tended to\nbe portraits, the ones that it actually went"},"1127":{"dur":5,"text":"out and wanted, rather than this kind of religious,\nemotional, dramatic painting."},"1133":{"dur":7,"text":"Yes, and I think not just religious, but very\nRoman Catholic in Its subject and treatment,"},"1141":{"dur":6,"text":"which I think in Protestant England, in the\n19th Century, where Catholics had only recently"},"1147":{"dur":2,"text":"been emancipated, was difficult."},"1149":{"dur":4,"text":"So I think this applies actually to paintings\nin the Italian Renaissance part of the collection"},"1154":{"dur":1,"text":"as well as the German paintings."},"1156":{"dur":5,"text":"There was always this difficulty with these\nvery Catholic subjects."},"1161":{"dur":2,"text":"When in doubt, turn to portraits."},"1163":{"dur":5,"text":"So proportionately there are always far more\nof those than there are of Crucifixions from"},"1169":{"dur":1,"text":"that school."},"1170":{"dur":1,"text":"Absolutely."},"1171":{"dur":2,"text":"And when they did acquire religious works,\nthey tended to have a slightly different character,"},"1173":{"dur":4,"text":"as I think we can see in some of the other\nworks here."},"1178":{"dur":2,"text":"So here we have the Kruger episode..."},"1181":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes."},"1182":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes."},"1183":{"dur":5,"text":"And I should say that we are working with\na PhD student on this project, who had

had"},"2755":{"dur":2,"text":"the Dresden version and the Darmstadt version."},"2758":{"dur":6,"text":"And there ensued a lot of debate between painters,\nconnoisseurs, art historians about which was"},"2764":{"dur":1,"text":"the original one."},"2765":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's very intriguing that Charles Eastlake,\nthat first Director who didn't particularly"},"2770":{"dur":3,"text":"care for German painting; he thought the Dresden\nversion was the superior."},"2774":{"dur":2,"text":"He thought, this one is much better."},"2776":{"dur":4,"text":"Nowadays, we recognise it was actually

\u00d0 well, a couple of different things;"},"2812":{"dur":4,"text":"one was the importance of religious subjects\nfor some of Holbein's early works, which are"},"2816":{"dur":1,"text":"difficult to appreciate here."},"2818":{"dur":5,"text":"But also that sense that for many people in\nthe 19th Century, especially before the invention"},"2823":{"dur":4,"text":"of photography, they would have actually only\nknown a lot of paintings through reproductive"},"2827":{"dur":3,"text":"prints rather than being able to see, you\nknow, the original works."},"2831":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, that's right."},"2832":{"dur":5,"text":"I think one of the questions that's raised\nis, how do you recognise a Holbein, how do"},"2837":{"dur":2,"text":"you recognise a D\u0178rer?"},"2840":{"dur":8,"text":"And, I mean, this is always a story that's\ninteresting to retell, but the painting that"},"2848":{"dur":6,"text":"you're seeing top right there, as it looks\nnow, a painting by a 15th Century South German"},"2854":{"dur":6,"text":"artist known as the Master of the Mornauer\nportrait was, in the 18th Century, sold as"},"2860":{"dur":5,"text":"a portrait of Martin Luther by Holbein, and\nit looked as you see it lower right."},"2866":{"dur":5,"text":"And that was how it came to the National Gallery\nin the early 1990s."},"2872":{"dur":6,"text":"And then that false background was very carefully\nremoved, and we now see it as it was."},"2878":{"dur":6,"text":"But obviously Holbein was a really saleable\nartist so in that way, perhaps he wasn't typically"},"2885":{"dur":1,"text":"German."},"2886":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes."},"2887":{"dur":4,"text":"And there's almost a sense of... because he\nlived in this

appreciate and to admire."},"2900":{"dur":6,"text":"And one of the kind of questions that we leave\na bit up for debate in that room is the extent"},"2907":{"dur":6,"text":"to which we see each of those three major\nartists; Holbein, D\u0178rer and Cranach; are"},"2913":{"dur":1,"text":"they kind of equally German?"},"2915":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, do we see Holbein as being, in a\ncertain sense, slightly less quintessentially"},"2920":{"dur":3,"text":"German because of the nature of his style\nand that almost photographic quality that"},"2923":{"dur":4,"text":"you see in some of his portraits, which is\nactually quite different, really, from D\u0178rer"},"2928":{"dur":1,"text":"and Cranach, I think?"},"2929":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes, very much so."},"2930":{"dur":5,"text":"And also the paintings from the National Gallery's\ncollection remind us that, again, we see him"},"2936":{"dur":7,"text":"as a portraitist and not as the author of\nreligious works, as in the Meyer print, or"},"2943":{"dur":4,"text":"the Dance of Death woodcuts, which also feature\nin one of our rooms."},"2948":{"dur":6,"text":"Perhaps we ought to end with just talking\nabout D\u0178rer and his reputation."},"2954":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes."},"2955":{"dur":1,"text":"Absolutely."},"2956":{"dur":4,"text":"Yes, so we've got a number of really wonderful\nHolbein works in this collection, and we've"},"2961":{"dur":2,"text":"just got a couple of D\u0178rer works in this\ncollection."},"2964":{"dur":6,"text":"I just wanted to show in this slide; in the\ncentre is one of the most famous

centuries,\nactually."},"2976":{"dur":5,"text":"And we represented that work in the exhibition\nthrough this reproductive print, although"},"2981":{"dur":3,"text":"as you can maybe see by the juxtaposition,\nit's a little bit of an interpretation."},"2985":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's not just showing the painting exactly\nas it exists, but it's almost like the artist's"},"2989":{"dur":3,"text":"reinterpretation, in a sense, of D\u0178rer's\nself-portrait."},"2992":{"dur":5,"text":"And then we've also got this portrait of D\u0178rer's\nfather, which was

1600,"},"3033":{"dur":2,"text":"in the period people call the D\u0178rer Renaissance."},"3036":{"dur":8,"text":"So it was one that really sort of got away\nfrom the Gallery, as it
