too."},"93":{"dur":3,"text":"So I started cooking\na long time ago."},"96":{"dur":1,"text":"When I started cooking\nfor other people,"},"98":{"dur":4,"text":"it was in the '70s, early\n'70s, actually late '60s,"},"102":{"dur":4,"text":"and in San Francisco, at the\nSan Francisco Zen Center."},"106":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is probably before\nmost of you were born."},"110":{"dur":3,"text":"And at that time,\nour mothers we're"},"113":{"dur":5,"text":"being seduced by companies who\nwanted them to make TV dinners,"},"118":{"dur":4,"text":"and Stouffers' souffles,\nand chicken pot pie."},"123":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was the beginning\nof big food really,"},"126":{"dur":5,"text":"and ease in the kitchen, which\nin part was easy to understand."},"132":{"dur":1,"text":"It was just after\nWorld War II, and it"},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"was a stressful time\nfor women and they"},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"liked to be relieved of that."},"138":{"dur":3,"text":"And as a kid, my mom didn't\nbuy into this at all,"},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"because she didn't want to\nspend the money on food."},"144":{"dur":3,"text":"But occasionally, there'd\nbe sales on pot pies."},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"And this was a big moment\nthat they'd go out,"},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"and we could have those."},"153":{"dur":4,"text":"But by the time I got to\nmove from Davis, California"},"157":{"dur":3,"text":"to San Francisco, and was\nliving at the Zen Center,"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"and I decided I\nwanted to cook there."},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"Because I knew I was going\nto be there and be working"},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"and it looks like the most\ninteresting thing to do."},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"And so when we had a\nhouse meeting one night--"},"173":{"dur":1,"text":"there were about\n60 of us who lived"},"174":{"dur":4,"text":"in a beautiful old\nbuilding on Page street."},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"We needed a cook,\nand my hand shot up."},"181":{"dur":4,"text":"And I didn't even really\nknow I wanted to do that."},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"I guess I did want to do it."},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"So nobody else did,\nso the job was mine."},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"And what I inherited in\nthis kitchen on Page Street,"},"194":{"dur":3,"text":"was a store room filled\nwith grains, and groats,"},"198":{"dur":3,"text":"and grits, whole grains."},"202":{"dur":6,"text":"And nobody knew how to cook\nthem, or what to do with them."},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"But there was a prevailing\nidea that what our parents were"},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"doing was not so good, and\nwe could make it better."},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"We should make it better."},"216":{"dur":1,"text":"You know how kids\nknow everything,"},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"and especially what's\nwrong with your parents,"},"221":{"dur":1,"text":"and the way they're living."},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"Except that we really\ndidn't know how to cook."},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"We didn't know a\ngrain from a grit."},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"We didn't know their properties."},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"Nobody knew how to\ncook anything really,"},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's not what\nwe were being taught,"},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"or what we were learning\nat school or at home."},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"And there were no cooking\nschools I might add."},"241":{"dur":5,"text":"So we just plunged in, and the\nresulting vegetarian, usually"},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"food was extremely\nheavy and dark"},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"and gray and brown and green."},"253":{"dur":4,"text":"And there were restaurants\nlike the Good karma Cafe over"},"257":{"dur":4,"text":"on Valencia Street, or the\nMinimum Daily Requirement,"},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"the MDR, that were\nthe vegetarian"},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"restaurants at the time."},"266":{"dur":6,"text":"And it just wasn't-- you'd have\nto have a very strong ethical"},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"profile to really\nenjoy eating this food,"},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"because it really\nwas not very good."},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is what I\ninherited, and I"},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"don't know how to\ncook it either."},"283":{"dur":1,"text":"But we did buy a grain mill."},"285":{"dur":4,"text":"We ground some of\nthese whole grains"},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"into flour for making bread."},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"That was good."},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"We could make\nmuffins and pancakes."},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"But the cook who had\npreceded me was macrobiotic,"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"and he was really a good cook."},"300":{"dur":5,"text":"But he stayed true to a lot\nof macrobiotic principles."},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"We had no sugar."},"306":{"dur":0,"text":"We had no butter."},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"We had no eggs."},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"It sounds vegan, doesn't it?"},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"And modern."},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"So pancakes, if you\ncould call them that,"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"were these flat rubbery\nthings like the soles"},"316":{"dur":5,"text":"of your shoes, nothing had\nany lift, nothing was light,"},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"especially when he tried to\nmake the Western style food."},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"So I did the backwards thing."},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"It looks backwards from today."},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"I introduced butter,\nand baking powder,"},"332":{"dur":4,"text":"and baking soda, and\neggs, and cheese."},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"Because I was really\ncooking for a community."},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"And a community, like a\nfamily is strengthened"},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"when it eats together, when\nit shares food together,"},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"talks over meals,\nbeing nourished"},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"by the same ingredients."},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"And the way it was then,\npeople didn't really"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"want to eat miso soup\nfor breakfast, and tofu,"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"and soy beans, and\nthings like that."},"360":{"dur":4,"text":"So they'd go down to a cafe on\nthe corner called Lums Cafe,"},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"and they would have pancakes\nand eggs, and toast,"},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"and smoke a cigarette, drink\ncoffee, read the newspaper,"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"like most people do."},"374":{"dur":5,"text":"So my job was really to bring\nthe cooking more in line"},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"with the taste of the\nstudents who were there,"},"383":{"dur":5,"text":"and what they would stay around\nand be comfortable eating,"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's what I did."},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"I really went from miso\nsoup and tofu and stuff"},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"like that for breakfast, which I\nactually happen to really like,"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"but went from that to\nmore familiar foods,"},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"to pancakes that looked like\npancakes that we were used"},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"to, to maple syrup, to put\na little butter on them."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know what Zen\nCenter is like nowadays,"},"410":{"dur":4,"text":"but I bet it has a really\nheavy vegan component,"},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"and I bet a lot of those foods\nare pushed way to the side."},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"I may be wrong."},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"But in any case,\nbeing a zen student"},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"was not being about food, it\nwas about zen practice and zen"},"426":{"dur":0,"text":"study."},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's not like we were\ncooking school or trying"},"430":{"dur":5,"text":"to do something with food,\nbut I took my job seriously."},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"How you get people to the table?"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"You serve something\nthat they recognize."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, it's lasagna."},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"It may be vegetarian\nlasagna, but it looked right."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"It's very different than\nhaving something on the plate,"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"and you go, what is that?"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't know what it is."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"You're a little\nnervous about it."},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"You're not really relaxed."},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"It's hard to dig in."},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"It's real hard to explain\nit to a guest who's there."},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"Like if we came to Google, and\neverything was so just utterly"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"strange, and so just\nutterly wonderful,"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"we'd be saying, what\nis this you're eating?"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"What is it you're doing?"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"Human beings get nervous\nif they don't understand."},"475":{"dur":4,"text":"So anyway that's how\nI got started cooking."},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"And I did that for about\n18 years at Zen Center."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"I cooked in a lot of\ndifferent capacities."},"485":{"dur":5,"text":"I cooked for students\nin every day situations"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"at the Zen Center\nin San Francisco."},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"I cooked for sesshins, which\nare seven-day intensive periods"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"of meditation where\nnobody is talking."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"And you really have\nto think it out,"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"because the meals are\nserved in the zen though."},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"They're served formally."},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"You want to feel light and\nnourished at the same time,"},"511":{"dur":0,"text":"not heavy."},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"You don't want to fall asleep\nafterwards during meditation."},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"I was a private chef for\nthe Abbott and his friends."},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"And my motto was always tea\nfor two, and six for tea."},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"It was like, oh, well we can\nadd six more, or ten more."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd be running down to\nthe field at Green Gulch,"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"and harvesting a little\nbit more food to cook."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"That was really\nhard, but it gave me"},"534":{"dur":4,"text":"a chance to do cooking that\nwas more elaborate, and more"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"adventurous really, and more\ninteresting, and more the kind"},"542":{"dur":4,"text":"of foods that eventually\nshowed up at green."},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"So you're asking about\ngreens, and how that started?"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"Is that what you wanted to know?"},"552":{"dur":7,"text":"So Zen Center owns a property\nnear Big Sur, called Tassajara,"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"or Zen Mountain Center,\nand it's our monastery."},"562":{"dur":5,"text":"And during the year, it's\nfor 100-day long periods"},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"of intense practice, two\nof them back to back."},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"And then in the summer,\nwe're opened to guests."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"And guests can come down,\nand they can just be guests,"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"and they can relax and so forth."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"So we cooked our food."},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"Originally, it\nwasn't vegetarian,"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"because it was owned by a\nfamily that wasn't vegetarian."},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"And so Ed Brown would be\nin there making lamb chops"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"and things, and the rest of\nus would be hanging around"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"like hungry dogs, going,\ncan I have some of that?"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"Would there be any leftover?"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"Actually, we weren't really\nvery good at vegetarian cooking."},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"People were hungry."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"They just wanted,\nlusted for something"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"more sustaining,\nespecially meat."},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"So that wasn't going to work."},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"So we decided to\nscratch that menu,"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"and just do vegetarian food."},"615":{"dur":4,"text":"And because Tassajara is so\nisolated-- have any of you"},"619":{"dur":0,"text":"ever been there?"},"620":{"dur":0,"text":"OK."},"621":{"dur":0,"text":"So you know."},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"It's like this 18-mile road\nthat goes up, and it goes down,"},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"and it winds, and there's like\na 10,000 foot drop on one side."},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not a road you're going\nto take casually to go to town"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"and find something to\neat that you'd prefer."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"So basically, we had\na captive audience."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"And we got better at cooking\nthe food over the years."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"I also cooked there,\ndid the guest season."},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"And people would say--\nbecause a lot of our guests"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"were from the Bay\nArea-- do you think"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"you could open a restaurant\nin San Francisco?"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"And you begin to\nhear that enough,"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you begin to\nthink, well, maybe."},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"And then Fort Mason opened,\nwhen the GGNRA started."},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"And they were looking for\na restaurant as a tenant,"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"but it had to be a non-profit."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"Now most restaurants\nare non-profit,"},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"but not by intention."},"671":{"dur":4,"text":"This had to be an organization\nthat was non-profit."},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"And the Zen Center\nwas, and it just"},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"seemed like the perfect fit."},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"So we got this building."},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"It's the same space where it is\ntoday, and it was a disaster."},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"It was filled with old\nbig pieces of machinery"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"that reeked of oil."},"693":{"dur":5,"text":"And the windows were about\nfive feet above the ground,"},"698":{"dur":0,"text":"above the floor."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"So we had to build a false\nfloor, because you're not"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"going to have windows you can't\nlook out and see the Golden"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"Gate Bridge, and the\nSan Francisco Bay."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"That would be really cruel."},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"So it took about a year\nto build out this space."},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"And during that year I actually\nworked at Chez Panisse,"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"or maybe the year\nbefore I started"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"working at Chez Panisse,\nI had met Alice Waters,"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"and her pastry\nchef, Lindsay Shere."},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"They came to Green Gulch\nto look at our farm,"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was asked to\nshow them around."},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"And as I did I was\nsaying things like,"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"have you ever heard\nof Richard Olney?"},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you make tarte tatin?"},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you do this?"},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"And finally, Alice\nsaid, haven't you ever"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"been to the restaurant?"},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, on $50 a month\nstipend, no I hadn't."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"So she said, I'd\nlike to invite you."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"Bring somebody."},"748":{"dur":5,"text":"So the next night, I went with\na friend, and we were smitten."},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's like I had had this\nlong quest for what I thought"},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"French food was, or should\nbe, and never found it."},"760":{"dur":0,"text":"And there I found it."},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"And I can still remember\neverything that we ate,"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"and how amazing it was."},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"I just came back, and told my\nabbot, I have to work there."},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what I'm going to do."},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"I have to work there."},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"And I started the next day."},"774":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was an amazing\nexperience to work there."},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"It was a lot of fun."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"Two years later, I didn't know\nthat there was this restaurant"},"783":{"dur":0,"text":"idea."},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"Of course, that's why\nI got to work there,"},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"because I was going to be the\nChef, but I didn't know that."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"So I thought I was just\nlearning a little bit"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"about how to cook\nat Chez Panisse."},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"Then one day, it\nwas like, well, you"},"796":{"dur":5,"text":"going to open this\nrestaurant, and so I did."},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"Chez Panisse is a very\nspecial restaurant."},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not like any place else."},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"So if that's your only\nexperience of a restaurant,"},"809":{"dur":4,"text":"and it happens to fit\nyour own vision perfectly."},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"To open a big restaurant, and\ndo things in a conventional way,"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"is really hard."},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't want things\nlike rolling racks, which"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"you absolutely have to\nhave in a restaurant."},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean there are these\nbig industrial racks"},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"that you put sheet pans on."},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't want those."},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to do\neverything by hand."},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just going to\nbe really soulful."},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, actually it was a\npretty soulful kitchen."},"837":{"dur":1,"text":"But we did get rolling racks."},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"And thank heavens\nwe did, because you"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"have to wake up, and\nbe smart at some point"},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"or you're going to hate it."},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"It was really hard\ndoing that restaurant."},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"We suddenly had\na big restaurant."},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"We got a great review within\nthe first three weeks,"},"855":{"dur":4,"text":"which meant we were serving\n300 plus lunches a day."},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"None of my staff were cooks."},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"So I had to teach\nthem all how to cook."},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm learning myself how\nto run a restaurant."},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"The learning curve was\npretty much like that."},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was just breathtaking."},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"It was so difficult."},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"But we had to figure\nout how to do things."},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"We had lots of failures."},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"We had some successes."},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"We focused on the successes,\nand then we began to build,"},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"and eventually\nopened for dinner."},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"In the beginning, our menus\nwere written five minutes"},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"before dinner time, and xeroxed,\nand there were misspellings."},"892":{"dur":4,"text":"Nobody understood that it's\nespresso, not expresso,"},"896":{"dur":4,"text":"and all those kind\nof nightmare things."},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"But actually the\nrestaurant really worked."},"903":{"dur":4,"text":"And I would say that most of our\ncustomers were not vegetarian."},"908":{"dur":3,"text":"They were coming, because\nI had a little reputation."},"911":{"dur":1,"text":"They were curious."},"913":{"dur":3,"text":"There was lots of parking, and\nthere was a view of the bay."},"916":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, what more\ncould you want?"},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it was mainly women\ncoming to try it out,"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"and then they'd come back on the\nweekends with their husbands."},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"And you could see these\nmen being dragged in."},"927":{"dur":2,"text":"They didn't want to go to\na vegetarian restaurant"},"930":{"dur":1,"text":"on Saturday night."},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"They wanted a steak."},"933":{"dur":5,"text":"And so I had to really make food\nthat would put them at ease,"},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"and would offer\nthem something that"},"941":{"dur":2,"text":"would take the\nplace of that meat"},"943":{"dur":1,"text":"in the center of the plate."},"945":{"dur":2,"text":"So I did food that\nwas complicated."},"947":{"dur":3,"text":"I did, like dulse,\nthe little crepes,"},"951":{"dur":5,"text":"and folded, and stacked, and\nrolled, and things that had"},"956":{"dur":2,"text":"form and shape in the\nmiddle of the plate"},"959":{"dur":4,"text":"that the eye could go\nto, a sauce or whatever."},"963":{"dur":2,"text":"It was complicated\ncooking, which"},"966":{"dur":4,"text":"is why the greens cookbook is my\nmost complicated book probably."},"971":{"dur":1,"text":"But it had to be that."},"972":{"dur":3,"text":"I had to offer something\nto take the place."},"976":{"dur":3,"text":"Now I think it's\nvery different times."},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't think we need\nto do that so much."},"981":{"dur":4,"text":"I think vegetarian food\ncan be and is much simpler."},"985":{"dur":2,"text":"People understand now, just\nbecause you're having it"},"988":{"dur":1,"text":"on one Saturday\nnight, it doesn't"},"989":{"dur":4,"text":"mean you're signing up for a\nlifestyle, unless you want to."},"994":{"dur":1,"text":"You can take a break."},"995":{"dur":1,"text":"Lots of people might\norder vegetarian food"},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"in a restaurant, because it's\njust different from having"},"1000":{"dur":4,"text":"salmon, lamb, beef, and chicken,\nthe same thing over and over"},"1005":{"dur":1,"text":"again."},"1006":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just another way of eating."},"1008":{"dur":2,"text":"For some people, it's\nthe only way of eating."},"1011":{"dur":3,"text":"Some
