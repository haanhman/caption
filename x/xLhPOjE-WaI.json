yesterday."},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"If you want to\nsend us stuff too,"},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"and we got loads of our\nstuff up on the board,"},"124":{"dur":5,"text":"you can send in study\nbuddies,

I think one of the\nones that I picked out"},"146":{"dur":4,"text":"was a nice poster of the\nhunt, which it all comes out"},"150":{"dur":0,"text":"and it's very good."},"151":{"dur":3,"text":"And we've been sending\nstuff to people quite a lot,"},"155":{"dur":2,"text":"but you've been sending us\nstuff so that's cool as well."},"157":{"dur":0,"text":"And -"},"158":{"dur":1,"text":"SOPHIE:

@studenthub."},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"So any thoughts, questions\nif you aren't in the Watch"},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"and Engage, Twitter and\nemail are a great workaround"},"205":{"dur":1,"text":"for that solution."},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"OK so we've been doing a lot\nof boot camp work lately."},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"We've been looking\nat a lot of skills."},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"This Freshers' Fair is all about\ncelebrating what the OU do."},"214":{"dur":2,"text":"Showing you some things\nthat you may not knew we do,"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"and talking a little bit\nabout being new students."},"218":{"dur":1,"text":"So the first session of\ntoday, I'm very pleased"},"220":{"dur":1,"text":"have Linda Robson in the studio."},"222":{"dur":0,"text":"LINDA ROBSON: Hello."},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're going to talk about\nwhat every student most needs"},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"to know, and we're going\nto do that in 25 minutes."},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's a limit."},"231":{"dur":4,"text":"And we've asked you to put your\nthoughts on our widget, which"},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"is, what three things might\ninterfere with your study plans"},"239":{"dur":1,"text":"and TMA submission?"},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, when we were\ntalking about this"},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"we thought how do\nwe structure this"},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"because there is so much that\nevery student needs to know."},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"And you had this brilliant\nidea about structuring it"},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"around a TMA, a Tutor\nMapped Assignment."},"252":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, tell us why was that?"},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"LINDA ROBSON: Well, the TMA\nis a very definite point"},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"within the study plan."},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, it's what you're\nworking towards really."},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"So you get to grips with\nthe study materials,"},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"and then the TMA comes along."},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's quite\nimportant as it helps"},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"you pace your work, as\nwell as an opportunity"},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"to get some feedback\non what you're doing."},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: OK, now we\nhad a session on assessment"},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"yesterday at the boot camp."},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"And we were talking\nabout how people"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"felt about their first TMA."},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"They were very excited\nand very enthusiastic."},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"They're also a very\norganised bunch."},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"They were looking forward\nto it, but there was"},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of anxiety around that."},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"Why is this something that\npeople have anxiety around?"},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"LINDA ROBSON: Oh,\nfor a lot of people"},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"it's the first\npiece of assessment"},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"they've done for many years."},"292":{"dur":4,"text":"But even if it's not, it still\ncan get quite anxious about it."},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"I've been an OU\nstudent for 17 years,"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"but I'll still get a little\nbit anxious about the TMA"},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"because it is the point\nwhere I'm testing what I know"},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"and testing my knowledge\nof the course material."},"308":{"dur":4,"text":"So it is something\nthat is a step to take."},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"You shouldn't be\nterrified of it."},"314":{"dur":4,"text":"But I think a certain sort\nof nervous commitment to it"},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"is actually quite\nhealthy and useful."},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Some\nnerves are helpful."},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, it helps you push\nyourself to make sure"},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"that you do do your best."},"326":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: OK."},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's talk about this in\nterms of how one might do a TMA"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"and structure some of\nthese things around that."},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the first thing that\nyou want to talk about"},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"is reading the module materials."},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, students were getting\nthese last week, I think,"},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"and the week beforehand."},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"And they were very\nexcited about those."},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"And we've also talked\nabout the importance"},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"of the virtual\nlearning environments"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"and how you can access a lot\nof your assessments online,"},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"and also the module materials."},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"So how is reading the\nmodule materials something"},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"that every student\nneeds to know?"},"352":{"dur":1,"text":"LINDA ROBSON: Well,\nyou need to know,"},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"if you start by looking\nat your calendar"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"and see the pace at which\nyou need to work through"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"so that you can plan\nwhat you're going to do,"},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"you might have\nholidays coming up."},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"So you need to plan\naround those as well."},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"But also, if you have a look\nforward to the TMA question"},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"as well, you will\nthen be able to have"},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"that in the back of\nyour mind as you're"},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"working through the\nmodule materials"},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"to pick out things that\nmight be particularly"},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"pertinent to the assessment\nthat you're going"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"to be doing in a little while."},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: So it's, I guess,\nlike a more structured reading"},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"approach, more targeted, so you\nknow what you're looking for."},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you can focus on\nwhat to remember, I guess,"},"385":{"dur":0,"text":"when you're doing\nthe assessment."},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"LINDA ROBSON:\nExactly, and you might"},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"want to make specific notes\nabout things that you think"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"are going to be key\npoints for the TMA,"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"so that when you then come to\nwant to reference back to them,"},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"you know that it's on page 2."},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"You might want to highlight\nyour materials if you've"},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"got paper-based materials."},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"Or you might have a notebook\nwhere you note things down."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"Different people take\ndifferent approaches."},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Now,\nyou're implying here"},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"that everything is in a book."},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"And of course, a lot\nof material is online."},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"And a lot of activities\nare online as well."},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"How do students make\nsense of reading"},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"in that sort of context."},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"Because I know\nstudents love books."},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"There's nothing like getting\nyour highlighters out"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"and drawing over them, or\nnot, as the case may be."},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"How would you recommend\nstudents engage with reading"},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"the online materials?"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"LINDA ROBSON: Again,\nit's individual choice."},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"So you have a choice."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"For most modules you can read\nit either through a web browser,"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"or there's the OU Anywhere\napp, which works really well"},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"on an iPad."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"Some people like\nit on their phone."},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"I find that far too small,\nbut it's at least portable."},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's a choice of ways\nto actually read the material."},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of it you can also\ndownload onto a Kindle as well."},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, in terms\nof making notes,"},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"some people might\ncut and paste things"},"454":{"dur":5,"text":"into a Word document or whatever\nform of electronic document"},"459":{"dur":0,"text":"you want."},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"Or you might make\npaper-based notes."},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"It's really up to you."},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think I would\nrecommend that people"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"try a number of different\nways in order to decide what's"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"actually working best for them."},"471":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: OK."},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, we asked our audience what\nmight interfere with their TMA"},"476":{"dur":0,"text":"submission."},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"Shall we see what they said?"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, let's have a look."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've got various\nthings: illness, work, time,"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"procrastination, visiting\ngirlfriends, pain control,"},"486":{"dur":0,"text":"Oh, that's good."},"487":{"dur":0,"text":"That's optimistic."},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"Life interruptions, being\norganised, five children"},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"- goodness me."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"Yes, they certainly\nmight interfere."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"Linda, these are\nvery common issues"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"for Open University students."},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"And a lot of students\nhave said in the chat,"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"oh, it's really nice to\nknow that other people have"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean a lot of people\nare watching the student"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"hub with the volume\nquite low, and probably"},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"children running\naround pouring cereal"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"over their computer, et cetera."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"We've heard of that yesterday."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"So how might these\nthings impact them"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of this organised\napproach to reading?"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"LINDA ROBSON: Well, having\na plan is your first start."},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"But given that most\nof our students"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"it would take at least six\nyears to get through a degree,"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"it's very unlikely that\nanyone's going to get through"},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"without some kind of blip\noccurring during that six year"},"532":{"dur":4,"text":"time, whether it's illness,\nbereavement, job changing,"},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"children coming and\ndoing various things."},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"So things will happen."},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"And the key thing to do is\nto tell someone about it"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"as soon as possible."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"So your tutor would be your\nfirst point of contact."},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"And often, it's\nuseful to tell someone"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"before it's become a crisis."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"So say I'm getting\na little bit behind."},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not sure what to do."},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"Can I have some advice on how\nto deal with this situation?"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"Or even, this situation\nmight become a problem."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"So plan ahead as far as you can."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"But in the event that\nsome kind of crisis"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"happens, people\nsuddenly become ill,"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you can't do\nsomething on a particular day,"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"just keep talking to your tutor."},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"They'll be the\nfirst point to call."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"And then they can feed\nthrough to other people"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"to give the support to\nhelp you get back on track."},"584":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Yeah."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"No, that's really - I've just\nhad my tutor group allocated."},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"And I sent them an\nemail yesterday."},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"And I've already heard\nback from a lot of them."},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"And some of them\nhave said, oh, I've"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"got this coming up\nor that coming up."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's really good to see\npeople planning and, I guess,"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"trying to predict\nsome of those things."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"But like you say, you\ncan't always predict them."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"But it is good to tell\npeople about those as well."},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"And also, I guess, bear\nin mind that a lot of this"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"is quite common, isn't it,\nfor Open University students."},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"People have lives going\non in the background."},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, if something\ndoes happen,"},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"it's unlikely that\nyou'd be on your own"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"or your tutor may have heard\nof it for the first time."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"It's always quite\ncommon, isn't it?"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, so we've got\na lot of students"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"here at level one,\n71% a level one."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"And interestingly, we've\ngot more students from STEM"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"today than FASS."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"STEM, obviously, Science,\nTechnology, Engineering,"},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"and Maths and FASS is Faculty\nof Arts and Social Sciences."},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"So we were talking\nabout assessment,"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"and we were talking about some\nof the anxieties around this."},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"And reading the\nquestion was something"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"that came up as a really\nimportant anxiety, and one"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"that we thought was\nfair enough and one"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"of the most common errors."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"So how is reading the\nquestion then something"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"that students need to be\nvery, very mindful of?"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"You said find the question,\ndo the reading around that."},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"But reading, and I\nguess more importantly,"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"understanding the question\nis really critical, isn't it?"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"LINDA ROBSON: Yeah, you need\nto look through the question"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"and pick out the key words."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"So is it, to start with, is\nit asking you for an essay."},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"Is it asking you\nto do some maths."},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"Try and identify what the key\nthing you think the mark will"},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"be looking for is."},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can check that\nwith your tutor as well."},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"So read the question, look\nfor the process words in it."},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"And focus in on\nthe topic, but make"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"sure you're not doing a brain\ndump of everything I ever knew"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"about this particular topic."},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"Because it's very\ntempting to do that."},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"Because you're all excited, you\nknow lots of things about this"},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"But most questions\nwill be asking"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"for one particular point."},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"So look at the question, try\nand break it apart to understand"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"what it's really looking for."},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, ask your\ntutor as well."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Would it help to\nread question to somebody else?"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"LINDA ROBSON: It may well do."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, if you've got a friend\nor a family member who's"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"interested, and I\nhope everyone has,"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"then do you discuss\nthe question with them."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"And they may have a different\nview on it and say well,"},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"do you think maybe\nit's asking for this?"},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"Or that doesn't make sense,\nthe answer that you've written."},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"And I would also say,\nwhen you get further"},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"on through the\nprocess and you've"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"got the draft of\nyour assignment,"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"ask the same friend to\nhave a read through it."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"And see if they can\nmake sense of it."},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"They don't need to be\nsubject specialist,"},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"but it should hang\ntogether and make sense."},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"And they may be able\nto pull out bits"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"where you've not explained\nsomething properly."},"732":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Now, this\nis an interesting idea"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"because I've heard\nso many people say,"},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"oh, they're not\ninterested, or they"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"don't know anything about this."},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"But I actually find,\npersonally, that it's"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"more important that somebody\nis just able to listen."},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"Because if we try to\nexplain something,"},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"it should hang together."},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, you're writing for\nan informed reader, your tutor."},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"But equally, there should\nbe some sense of it."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you can't explain\nwhat you're talking about,"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"then maybe you aren't being as\nclear as you might like to be."},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"So would it be good\nthen just to talk"},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"to anybody about\nwhat you're trying"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"to do with your assignment?"},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"LINDA ROBSON: Yeah,\nand I think you quickly"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"find you talk to
