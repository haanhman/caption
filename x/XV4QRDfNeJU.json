A wonderful seminary began, I don't"},"781":{"dur":6,"text":"know how many years ago, but it began just\noffering specific theological biblical degrees,"},"788":{"dur":6,"text":"and then, over the past five years, has developed\na range of programs.

And it's integrated\nin the sense that they're learning that from"},"830":{"dur":5,"text":"a Christian point of view. But, obviously,\nit requires other skills on the part of teachers,"},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"other programs."},"837":{"dur":1,"text":"Darrell Bock: So they're fishers of fish and\nfishers of men."},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"Scott Cunningham: Yeah, exactly. That's the\nconnection. Yeah, so other schools are doing"},"843":{"dur":9,"text":"things in business, in teacher training, in\ncomputer science, things of that nature."},"853":{"dur":7,"text":"Darrell Bock: So as you look at education\noverseas and you see this scope of what's"},"860":{"dur":5,"text":"being covered, let me ask you this kind of\na question. Obviously, you've spent a lot"},"866":{"dur":6,"text":"of time outside the West, but you were educated\nhere. So you understand both systems. What"},"872":{"dur":7,"text":"do you see happening overseas that you don't\nsee happening here, that you find interesting"},"880":{"dur":5,"text":"or intriguing?
