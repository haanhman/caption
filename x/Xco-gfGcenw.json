{"8":{"dur":3,"text":"This week I've been doing quite a lot of research\non the Isle of Portland"},"11":{"dur":5,"text":"on the south coast of England\nand I discovered that the first Viking raid"},"17":{"dur":5,"text":"which was reported in the Anglo Saxon Chronicles\nwas reported to have taken place in the year"},"23":{"dur":3,"text":"789AD\nand that's the first recorded Viking raid"},"26":{"dur":2,"text":"that we know about in England.\nSo that's been really really interesting."},"29":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a place that I spent a lot of time\nas a child"},"33":{"dur":5,"text":"living on the south coast of England\nand interestingly is almost directly across"},"38":{"dur":3,"text":"from Alderney\nbut on the other side of the water"},"42":{"dur":4,"text":"and during the Viking Age\nthis was actually part of the Kingdom of Wessex."},"46":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's also a place that I learnt about\nduring my geography lessons at school"},"49":{"dur":3,"text":"because it's the classical example of\na tombolo"},"53":{"dur":3,"text":"or a tombolo I'm never sure how to pronounce\nthose"},"56":{"dur":4,"text":"and is the kind of classical thing that you\nlearn about in your geography lessons."},"61":{"dur":4,"text":"Particularly Chesil Beach.\nSo its been really exciting this week to find"},"65":{"dur":4,"text":"out a little more about that part of the British\ncoastline"},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"and might just be the first place that I start\nmy expedition from"},"74":{"dur":4,"text":"having learnt a little more about it.\nAnd according to the Anglo Saxon Chronicle"},"78":{"dur":4,"text":"we know that three ships came over from Hordaland\nin Norway"},"82":{"dur":5,"text":"or what would be today Norway\nand I don't quite know what happened"},"88":{"dur":3,"text":"I've\nI, in researching I've come across two different"},"91":{"dur":4,"text":"versions\nThe first is that the three ships were lost"},"96":{"dur":3,"text":"at sea\nthey were travelling and they got blown off"},"100":{"dur":1,"text":"course\nand they landed"},"101":{"dur":4,"text":"on the Isle of Portland by mistake\nwithout planning to come there"},"106":{"dur":5,"text":"and the second is that it was a planned raid.\nSo I'm not really sure what the truth is"},"111":{"dur":4,"text":"those are the two versions.\nBut essentially"},"115":{"dur":4,"text":"the Viking people arrived\nthey had actually been trading with Britain"},"119":{"dur":2,"text":"for\na number of years very peacefully"},"122":{"dur":3,"text":"so this is the first known actual raid or\nattack"},"126":{"dur":5,"text":"and as they arrived on the Isle of Portland\nthey were met by the local tax men"},"131":{"dur":5,"text":"who tried to encourage them to go to Dorchester\nI think"},"137":{"dur":4,"text":"and to go and pay the taxes for trading\nbut the Vikings refused"},"141":{"dur":5,"text":"and ended up killing the tax guys instead.\nNow having sailed around the coast with the"},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"Royal Navy before\nand from stories of other sailors"},"151":{"dur":4,"text":"I wouldn't be surprised if it is true that\nthe Vikings got"},"155":{"dur":4,"text":"washed ashore\nbecause you do get some very strange"},"159":{"dur":4,"text":"weather and currents around that area\nso it wouldn't surprise me one little bit"},"164":{"dur":5,"text":"if they did end up there by mistake\nespecially in those days as well"},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"without all the technology that we have today.\nIn fact there is actually a special boat called"},"173":{"dur":3,"text":"the Lerret Boat\nwhich was designed by the local fishermen"},"176":{"dur":3,"text":"who fished on Chesil Beach and they designed\nthis special boat"},"180":{"dur":4,"text":"to actually cope with the conditions of the\nweather and the local"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of\ngeological and geographical conditions as"},"187":{"dur":4,"text":"well.\nAnd this week I drew a picture of the Lerret"},"192":{"dur":3,"text":"Boat\nfor my students and for my book"},"195":{"dur":4,"text":"which you can see there.\nThat is the Lerret Boat."},"200":{"dur":4,"text":"And this was built by the fishermen around\n1615AD."},"205":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was designed to cope with the steep\nshingle bank and the local weather conditions."},"209":{"dur":6,"text":"And it is quite unusual compared to most boats\nbut actually not compared to the Viking boats."},"215":{"dur":4,"text":"Because it can be rowed from either side\nso you could pull the boat in one way"},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"and then pull it back out which is something\nthe Vikings did"},"223":{"dur":6,"text":"so that they could make a quick getaway.\nAnd it also has no row locks to hold the oars"},"230":{"dur":4,"text":"but it does have these special\nhole pins"},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"and it is generally rowed by four people\nand the oars are a lot thinner"},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"than you would find on other boats\nso I found this very interesting"},"240":{"dur":4,"text":"particularly as I'm going to be building my\nboat as well."},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"And the Lerret boat would also have a fifth\nperson"},"247":{"dur":4,"text":"who would be in charge of the steering and\nalso pulling in the fishing nets"},"252":{"dur":3,"text":"so I found that really interesting this week.\nThere is my picture of it there"},"256":{"dur":5,"text":"that is the Lerret Boat.\nAnd all of these pictures I make are available"},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"on\nthe Times Educational Supplement"},"264":{"dur":3,"text":"Teachers Pay Teachers\nwhich is part of my fundraising for the boat"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"and if you

kind of a colouring book\nabout the Great British Viking Quest as I"},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"follow the Viking routes around Britain."},"289":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's what I've been doing this week.\nReally just learning about Portland"},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"the Isle of Portland\nthe local boat building"},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"and I've been learning about the quarries\nin Portland as well"},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"so it's something that's\nPortland is very famous for"},"304":{"dur":4,"text":"it's actually mostly limestone\nand the limestone rock"},"309":{"dur":4,"text":"Portland Rock is used all around the world\nbut you will actually find it on things like"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"Buckingham Palace\nin London"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"and St Paul's Cathedral\nso it's pretty famous"},"319":{"dur":5,"text":"and the quarries still work today as well.\nAnd one of the interesting things I found"},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"out was that there's a superstition on the\nIsle of Portland"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"about rabbits and you shouldn't ever talk\nabout rabbits"},"330":{"dur":8,"text":"because the local people get quite upset\nand I think that this superstition comes from"},"338":{"dur":4,"text":"when people have been working in the quarries\nbefore the quarries have collapsed"},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"or there has been a rock fall\nthe last thing they have seen are rabbits"},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"so\nperhaps where there are rabbit burrows or"},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"rabbit warrens\nand these big tunnels so that is why the ground"},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"has caved in\nso it's a bit of a local superstition."},"357":{"dur":7,"text":"Which I'm interested in finding out more about\nand I'm also really excited because Portland"},"365":{"dur":4,"text":"when I fly over to Alderney\none of the things that I see as I fly over"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"which is really iconic\nis this big red and white"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"lighthouse\nwhich is one of the things I'm really looking"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"forward to seeing\nactually from the sea"},"378":{"dur":5,"text":"and I didn't realise that Portland had\noriginally three lighthouses"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"but the other two\ndon't work now"},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"and the\nPortland Bill"},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"which is the red and white one\nthat you see from the air"},"391":{"dur":5,"text":"is automated now.\nBut people wanted to have a lighthouse there"},"396":{"dur":6,"text":"for quite a long time\nway before the Romans were there and"},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"before they had lighthouses\npeople would actually light fires to help"},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"guide\nthe ships"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"around the coastline\nbecause it was quite dangerous"},"410":{"dur":4,"text":"and then this one guy called Sir John Clayton\nhe wanted to build a lighthouse there"},"415":{"dur":5,"text":"in about 1669 I think it was\nand he was told that he couldn't build it"},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"because it would\njust be too expensive"},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"so he had been petitioning for a lighthouse\nfor a long, long time."},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"But they didn't get one until\nabout 1903"},"428":{"dur":4,"text":"between 1903-1905\nPortland Bill was finally built so"},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"it has made quite a big difference I think\nto the safety"},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"and is certainly one of the things people look for\nparticularly sailors"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"when they are racing around the coastline\nso"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"it is one of the things I am really looking\nforward to seeing"},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"and is just so iconic.\nBut the Isle of Portland also has a very strong"},"449":{"dur":4,"text":"Roman connection\nand the Romans called it Vindelis"},"453":{"dur":5,"text":"and I think this is a term that is still used\nby the local people as well."},"458":{"dur":4,"text":"And the other very interesting thing I found\nout about Portland is that there are 32 places"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"in the world\nwith the name Portland"},"466":{"dur":5,"text":"and all of them I think apart from 1 are named\nafter this particular Portland"},"471":{"dur":4,"text":"so Portland in Oregon is one example\nthat's in America"},"475":{"dur":6,"text":"and that is named after Portland in England.\nAnd the only one that isn't named after Portland"},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"is named after the Duke of Portland\nand that is in New Zealand"},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"and it only has one person living there.\nSo it has been quite good fun learning about"},"490":{"dur":4,"text":"some new places this week.\nAnd this week I have been working on my seamanship"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"and navigation\nI've started to look at some of my nautical"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"charts\nand I thought I would start with Portland"},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"since it is the first\nplace that the Vikings raided"},"503":{"dur":5,"text":"according to the Anglo Saxon Chronicle\nand it is also somewhere I fly over when I"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"travel\nto and from Alderney."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"And is somewhere I learnt about in geography\nso I thought that would make sense"},"515":{"dur":4,"text":"to be the first place that I learn about.\nAnd it is actually really interesting on the"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"nautical maps\nyou can see"},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"there is a special symbol which shows where\nthe shipwrecks are"},"525":{"dur":5,"text":"there are loads of shipwrecks and\nsome of those you have to be very careful"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"there are some\nobstructions as well"},"534":{"dur":6,"text":"On the nautical chart you can see the castle\nwhich was built by King Henry VIII to defend"},"540":{"dur":5,"text":"Britain against the French.\nAnd you can see this barrier beach or tombolo"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"which is Chesil Beach so you can see that\non the charts as well."},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"It is really big.\nAnd you can see the kind of lagoons behind"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"it too.\nYou can see the three lighthouses including"},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"Portland Bill which is the one that still\nfunctions today"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"and you can see some of the quarries\nso some of them are still being used and some"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"of them aren't.\nYou can see the fishing areas"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"and rather worryingly you can also see\na firing range"},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"which is really big\nso I'll have to be very careful when I'm rowing"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"around\nthat I don't cross"},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"when they are firing and having a\npractice firing so"},"577":{"dur":4,"text":"because that could be quite interesting.\nAnd this week I have been doing"},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"lots of really tedious, little jobs but I\nhave finished those now"},"586":{"dur":5,"text":"so I am really happy about that.\nThe website is finished which is

to"},"646":{"dur":6,"text":"popular culture.\nAnd so every evening I've been doing a little"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"reading from that\nwhich has been really good"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"and loads of
