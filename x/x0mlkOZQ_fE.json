decay?"},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, neutron decays into\nthree particles-- a proton,"},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"it's just a fancy way\nof writing an electron--"},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"a proton, electron, and a\nneutrino, another particle."},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"The key point, however, is that\nthe neutron and proton weigh"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"almost exactly the same amount."},"784":{"dur":5,"text":"The difference between these\ntwo masses is one part in 1,000."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the neutron has barely\nenough energy to

is"},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"a hell of a long time in\nparticle physics units."},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, so it seems\nlike an eternity."},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is a very\nlong-lived

yourself?"},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's an accident, OK?"},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"What happens when I put\na neutron in a nucleus?"},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, it follows the

means that\ntakes energy to get out."},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"You lose energy\nwhen you get bound."},"837":{"dur":1,"text":"And so the neutron\nfollows the nucleus."},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"Loses energy, but E\nequals mc squared."},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"So the neutron gets lighter."},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"And when the neutrons gets in\na nucleus, it no longer as--"},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"its mass is too small to\ndecay into these particles."},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"So neutrons are only\nstable in nuclei"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"by that accident that the
