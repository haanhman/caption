it."},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"So by the end of the two weeks\nthat we were there, I had this"},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"idea that I would write about\na young woman who is in

years ago, and I"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"had an idea for a novel."},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"I called my agent, and I said,\nhere's a new idea."},"585":{"dur":6,"text":"It's three Americans in

keeping"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"myself out of trouble."},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"So I wrote that novel,\nand by the time I was"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"finished, I loved it."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"I was really happy with the\nworld that I had created."},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"And I sent it to her, and I\nsaid, here's my novel about"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"three Americans in

had."},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"And she read it, and loved it."},"649":{"dur":5,"text":"A writer's dream is what's\ncalled an auction."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"So when an agent goes out with\na book,
