thro"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"them onto the machine and you can connect them to"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"model the typology you\u2019re interested in."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"The machine is highly parallel and the thing that"},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"kills parallel computation is synchronisation,"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"so on SpiNNaker, we just don't do it."},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"We'd run the

out."},"3496":{"dur":2,"text":"So we'll see how that goes."},"3499":{"dur":4,"text":"Alright, so first off, what does quantum\ntechnology mean?"},"3503":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's difficult to define

field."},"3608":{"dur":2,"text":"So before cracking on with my talk, I just want"},"3611":{"dur":2,"text":"to mention that there has recently been a"},"3613":{"dur":3,"text":"massive investment in these technologies in"},"3616":{"dur":4,"text":"the UK, that went live in December 2014."},"3620":{"dur":5,"text":"This was...

involved in the process of"},"3642":{"dur":4,"text":"selecting which aspects of the technology to push."},"3647":{"dur":2,"text":"Alright, so first off, quantum computing."},"3649":{"dur":2,"text":"What... excuse me."},"3651":{"dur":2,"text":"The thing I\u2019d like to talk about for the rest of"},"3653":{"dur":2,"text":"my slot is computing as opposed to, for example,"},"3656":{"dur":2,"text":"sensors and communication systems, fascinating"},"3658":{"dur":1,"text":"though they are."},"3660":{"dur":2,"text":"So in order to talk about quantum computing,"},"3662":{"dur":2,"text":"I need to introduce you, if you're not already"},"3665":{"dur":2,"text":"familiar, to the chap on my right here which is"},"3667":{"dur":2,"text":"the Qubit, the

things."},"3694":{"dur":3,"text":"But what quantum physics tell us is that any"},"3697":{"dur":3,"text":"system that can be one of two things can in fact"},"3701":{"dur":2,"text":"be much richer than that."},"3703":{"dur":2,"text":"Quantum physics allows in principle for something"},"3706":{"dur":1,"text":"called superposition."},"3708":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is the capacity of a system to be in"},"3711":{"dur":2,"text":"what in everyday language we should say is"},"3714":{"dur":2,"text":"two states at the same time."},"3716":{"dur":2,"text":"So then you have the idea of a little entity that"},"3719":{"dur":3,"text":"can be a zero, it can be a one or it can be"},"3722":{"dur":2,"text":"at the same time, zero and one."},"3725":{"dur":3,"text":"As paradoxical and counterintuitive as that\nsounds."},"3728":{"dur":1,"text":"And when we fully work it through, we find that"},"3730":{"dur":1,"text":"it's really a very rich opera."},"3732":{"dur":2,"text":"A single Quantum Bit, the basic unit of information"},"3735":{"dur":3,"text":"that's allowed by quantum physics is much"},"3738":{"dur":1,"text":"richer than a Bit."},"3739":{"dur":2,"text":"So here, this diagram, this thing is called the"},"3742":{"dur":3,"text":"Bloch sphere and it's how we picture the basic"},"3745":{"dur":3,"text":"units of information in quantum science."},"3748":{"dur":2,"text":"The points on the surface of the sphere represent"},"3751":{"dur":2,"text":"all the different conditions that our quantum"},"3753":{"dur":1,"text":"Bit can be in."},"3755":{"dur":2,"text":"The North pole, we could think of as corresponding"},"3758":{"dur":2,"text":"to a Bit in state zero and the South pole,"},"3760":{"dur":2,"text":"corresponding to a Bit in state one."},"3763":{"dur":1,"text":"Those are distinguishable and have their"},"3764":{"dur":1,"text":"familiar properties."},"3765":{"dur":3,"text":"But we're also allowed to prepare our Quantum Bit"},"3769":{"dur":3,"text":"in any combination of zero and one, and so"},"3772":{"dur":2,"text":"for example, the points around the equator there"},"3775":{"dur":1,"text":"are the ones that have an equal amount of"},"3777":{"dur":2,"text":"zero and one in superposition but we can also"},"3779":{"dur":4,"text":"make a lopsided state that favours zero or\nfavours one."},"3783":{"dur":3,"text":"So just to emphasise, this is not saying that it's"},"3787":{"dur":2,"text":"a zero or a one but we don't know which it is,"},"3790":{"dur":1,"text":"and we're using this fancy word to describe"},"3791":{"dur":1,"text":"our lack of knowledge."},"3793":{"dur":3,"text":"The physical system really is in a condition which"},"3797":{"dur":4,"text":"in everyday language is zero and one at the same time."},"3801":{"dur":1,"text":"It's an exact state of that system."},"3803":{"dur":1,"text":"You could think of it as an atom, for example."},"3806":{"dur":3,"text":"Before moving on then, actually, even before that,"},"3809":{"dur":2,"text":"the humble Qubit already shows us some exciting"},"3812":{"dur":2,"text":"things; the idea of information being not just"},"3815":{"dur":2,"text":"zero and one but both at the same time."},"3817":{"dur":3,"text":"It also, we can notice a feature that presages"},"3821":{"dur":2,"text":"the problem for our field, which is that we"},"3824":{"dur":1,"text":"can't get at that information."},"3826":{"dur":3,"text":"If I give you a Qubit and I put it in a particular"},"3829":{"dur":2,"text":"state and I don't tell you what that state is,"},"3831":{"dur":4,"text":"you cannot find that out just by measuring it once."},"3836":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the act of measuring a Qubit will cause it"},"3838":{"dur":2,"text":"to collapse to the options that you give it."},"3840":{"dur":1,"text":"There is zero one one, or you can measure it in"},"3842":{"dur":2,"text":"different ways, but you can't tell exactly which"},"3845":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of superposition I\u2019ve given you with one go."},"3849":{"dur":3,"text":"If I give you lots of copies of the same Qubit"},"3852":{"dur":3,"text":"independently, you could hone in by measuring and"},"3856":{"dur":1,"text":"then say \"Okay, now I\u2019m going to measure it a\nbit differently\""},"3857":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Now I\u2019m going to take my next one and measure\nit a bit differently.\""},"3860":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can zoom in to the information you\nwant to learn."},"3863":{"dur":3,"text":"But nature will not let us get at that in one go."},"3866":{"dur":2,"text":"Nature knows the state of our Qubit,"},"3869":{"dur":1,"text":"that if we want to find it out so that we can"},"3871":{"dur":2,"text":"write it down as a piece of conventional information"},"3873":{"dur":1,"text":"we will need several goes at it."},"3875":{"dur":3,"text":"So before moving on, the provocative thought"},"3879":{"dur":1,"text":"about why this might be powerful computing"},"3881":{"dur":0,"text":"is the following:"},"3882":{"dur":3,"text":"If we have N bits, we can form a string of those"},"3886":{"dur":2,"text":"N bits, a series of zeros and ones, which can"},"3888":{"dur":2,"text":"represent some data for us or a number."},"3891":{"dur":2,"text":"If we have N Qubits, what does that look like?"},"3893":{"dur":2,"text":"If we have multiple instances of this chap here?"},"3896":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, if one of them can be zero and one at the"},"3899":{"dur":2,"text":"same time then two of them can either be zero zero,"},"3901":{"dur":2,"text":"or zero one, or one zero, or one one at the\nsame time."},"3903":{"dur":2,"text":"Four different states in superposition are\nthen possible."},"3906":{"dur":2,"text":"Similarly, eight and sixteen, and so forth."},"3908":{"dur":5,"text":"So the number of different conventional states"},"3913":{"dur":2,"text":"which exist simultaneously within one piece of"},"3916":{"dur":4,"text":"hardware goes up exponentially with the size\nof the device."},"3921":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reason that's exciting is then if we do"},"3923":{"dur":3,"text":"an operation on, let's start calling it a computer,"},"3927":{"dur":4,"text":"a computer memory, I might just reach in and"},"3931":{"dur":3,"text":"perform a small calculation using a series of"},"3934":{"dur":1,"text":"Qubits as my input."},"3936":{"dur":2,"text":"Performing that calculation once forces nature"},"3939":{"dur":3,"text":"to perform that calculation on every element of"},"3942":{"dur":3,"text":"the superposition at once, so nature will have to"},"3946":{"dur":4,"text":"do an enormous amount of work where a"},"3950":{"dur":2,"text":"conventional computer in the same circumstances"},"3953":{"dur":1,"text":"would have just worked out one thing, but nature"},"3955":{"dur":3,"text":"will need to work it out for everything\nin the superposition."},"3958":{"dur":2,"text":"This is sometimes called quantum parallelism."},"3960":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not actually having a whole set of different chips."},"3963":{"dur":2,"text":"It's having one chip capable of being in a"},"3965":{"dur":2,"text":"superposition and using that fact."},"3968":{"dur":2,"text":"Very, very potentially exciting and yet still the"},"3971":{"dur":2,"text":"problem of getting the information back out"},"3973":{"dur":2,"text":"at the end which limits what we can do."},"3976":{"dur":1,"text":"But what can we do?"},"3977":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is the software."},"3978":{"dur":2,"text":"So these are the famous things that we know"},"3981":{"dur":1,"text":"that a quantum computer can do and they have"},"3983":{"dur":1,"text":"been very well studied."},"3985":{"dur":3,"text":"The most famous of them probably is Code Breaking."},"3988":{"dur":3,"text":"By taking the core of a machine and allowing it to"},"3991":{"dur":2,"text":"be in many different conditions at once,"},"3994":{"dur":3,"text":"we can find essentially the key to a code in"},"3998":{"dur":2,"text":"far fewer steps than if we had to individually"},"4000":{"dur":1,"text":"test them one at a time."},"4001":{"dur":2,"text":"More formally, code breaking here means factoring"},"4004":{"dur":2,"text":"big numbers which is the technique that would"},"4006":{"dur":3,"text":"allow you to crack the codes that, for example,"},"4010":{"dur":1,"text":"protect credit card information when it's"},"4011":{"dur":1,"text":"sent over the internet."},"4013":{"dur":2,"text":"This becomes a problem with period finding and we"},"4015":{"dur":3,"text":"can do that very efficiently by harnessing

today, Feynman's original idea for actually"},"4036":{"dur":2,"text":"inspiring the idea of a quantum computer."},"4038":{"dur":1,"text":"Simulation means taking a system we'd like to"},"4040":{"dur":2,"text":"understand better: a super conductor."},"4043":{"dur":1,"text":"Why are superconductors working at some"},"4044":{"dur":2,"text":"temperatures but then other materials manage"},"4047":{"dur":0,"text":"to get a higher temperature?"},"4048":{"dur":0,"text":"Can we get to room temperature?"},"4049":{"dur":3,"text":"That is a problem of simulation but very, very"},"4052":{"dur":3,"text":"important for future generations of technology."},"4056":{"dur":2,"text":"That could also be approached with a quantum computer."},"4058":{"dur":3,"text":"Each of these is then very well examined and studied,"},"4061":{"dur":1,"text":"but each of them has limitations."},"4063":{"dur":3,"text":"In particular, code breaking whilst dramatic"},"4067":{"dur":2,"text":"and profound and disruptive, perhaps,"},"4070":{"dur":2,"text":"doesn\u2019t seem to be the kind of thing that has a"},"4072":{"dur":1,"text":"huge market for it."},"4073":{"dur":2,"text":"If we build a

say?"},"4113":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, what we can say is that this is a relatively"},"4117":{"dur":2,"text":"much younger area and newer set of ideas"},"4120":{"dur":1,"text":"compared to these ones,

one."},"4128":{"dur":2,"text":"So what I\u2019d like to do just briefly, without using"},"4131":{"dur":2,"text":"up too much of my talk is just to introduce you"},"4133":{"dur":3,"text":"to two

about"},"5193":{"dur":3,"text":"some cool new hardware and I really look forward"},"5197":{"dur":1,"text":"to getting my hands on some of this hardware"},"5199":{"dur":1,"text":"that's being built."},"5200":{"dur":4,"text":"But it's my belief that actually, to crack intelligence,"},"5204":{"dur":2,"text":"we are going to need some big algorithmic"},"5206":{"dur":3,"text":"breakthroughs as

hardware."},"5217":{"dur":3,"text":"So AI is really the science of making machines smart,"},"5220":{"dur":2,"text":"and basically, there's two ways of doing this."},"5223":{"dur":3,"text":"One is that you can pre-programme a solution"},"5226":{"dur":2,"text":"into the computer and have the computer sort"},"5229":{"dur":3,"text":"of dumbly but efficiently execute that solution."},"5232":{"dur":3,"text":"A second way is that in fact, you could teach"},"5236":{"dur":3,"text":"machines, give them the ability to learn for"},"5239":{"dur":3,"text":"themselves how to solve a particular task."},"5243":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's that second type of artificial intelligence"},"5245":{"dur":2,"text":"that we're interested in and we're working on"},"5248":{"dur":1,"text":"at DeepMind."},"5252":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, DeepMind was founded in 2010."},"5256":{"dur":4,"text":"And we were acquired by Google last year."},"5260":{"dur":4,"text":"So since then we've been accelerating our kind"},"5264":{"dur":2,"text":"of research programme."},"5267":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, the idea behind DeepMind was to create a"},"5271":{"dur":4,"text":"kind of Apollo programme effort for\nArtificial Intelligence."},"5275":{"dur":2,"text":"And we currently have more than 100 research"},"5278":{"dur":1,"text":"scientists so I think it's the largest collection"},"5280":{"dur":2,"text":"of scientists that are focusing on this area"},"5282":{"dur":1,"text":"anywhere in the world."},"5284":{"dur":3,"text":"Really, the idea behind it was that to try and"},"5287":{"dur":2,"text":"create a kind of new way of organising science."},"5290":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we tried to do with DeepMind was to"},"5293":{"dur":3,"text":"combine the best of academia or at least how"},"5296":{"dur":2,"text":"it should work in an idealised case,"},"5298":{"dur":4,"text":"so Blue Sky ambitious thinking, interdisciplinary"},"5302":{"dur":3,"text":"collaborations and then combine that with"},"5305":{"dur":2,"text":"the best from start-ups and industry."},"5308":{"dur":4,"text":"So energy and focus, and the efficiency and"},"5312":{"dur":4,"text":"resources you find in the private sector."},"5319":{"dur":3,"text":"So our mission at DeepMind is very easy to articulate"},"5322":{"dur":1,"text":"but obviously quite hard to do,"},"5324":{"dur":2,"text":"and we usually describe it as a two step process."},"5326":{"dur":2,"text":"So step one: solve intelligence,"},"5328":{"dur":3,"text":"and then step two: use it to solve everything else."},"5332":{"dur":4,"text":"So although this is a slightly fanciful way of"},"5337":{"dur":2,"text":"showing it, I really believe that the power of"},"5339":{"dur":1,"text":"general artificial intelligence that I\u2019m going to"},"5341":{"dur":2,"text":"show a little bit of later today, in its fullest"},"5343":{"dur":3,"text":"form, could eventually realise this."},"5349":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, how are we going to achieve that kind of\nambitious mission?"},"5352":{"dur":3,"text":"So prosaically, we're going to try and create what"},"5355":{"dur":3,"text":"we call 'general purpose learning machines'."},"5359":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's two key words there: general and learning."},"5361":{"dur":2,"text":"So I already said that the things we're interested"},"5364":{"dur":2,"text":"in building at DeepMind are learning algorithms"},"5367":{"dur":1,"text":"and what we mean by that is algorithms that are"},"5369":{"dur":2,"text":"capable of learning automatically from raw data,"},"5371":{"dur":1,"text":"from the raw input."},"5373":{"dur":3,"text":"They're not pre-programmed or hand-crafted\nin any way."},"5377":{"dur":3,"text":"Secondly, we insist on them being general and"},"5380":{"dur":3,"text":"that means the same system or same set of"},"5383":{"dur":2,"text":"algorithms out of the box, being able to operate"},"5386":{"dur":2,"text":"across a wide range of tasks."},"5391":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, we call this type of artificial intelligence"},"5393":{"dur":3,"text":"internally at DeepMind, Artificial General Intelligence:\nAGI."},"5397":{"dur":3,"text":"The hallmarks of AGI are that it's kind of flexible"},"5401":{"dur":1,"text":"and adaptive and it's built to be flexible and"},"5403":{"dur":2,"text":"adaptive from the ground up."},"5405":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, we call it this term to distinguish it from"},"5408":{"dur":2,"text":"what is normally thought of as AI and in fact,"},"5411":{"dur":1,"text":"the majority of AI out there, especially in"},"5413":{"dur":2,"text":"industry which we think of actually more as"},"5415":{"dur":1,"text":"Narrow AI."},"5416":{"dur":3,"text":"That type of AI, so things like Siri on your phone,"},"5420":{"dur":2,"text":"these are bespoke pieces of software that have"},"5423":{"dur":3,"text":"been created to solve one single task."},"5426":{"dur":0,"text":"And the most..."},"5427":{"dur":1,"text":"I just want to illustrate the difference between"},"5428":{"dur":3,"text":"these two types of regimes: AGI and Narrow AI."},"5431":{"dur":1,"text":"They are probably the most famous examples"},"5433":{"dur":2,"text":"still of AI, or Narrow AI."},"5436":{"dur":2,"text":"That's IBM's Deep Blue that beat Garry Kasparov"},"5438":{"dur":3,"text":"in the late nineties."},"5442":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, this is of course an amazing technical feat."},"5444":{"dur":1,"text":"It was kind of a watershed moment in AI"},"5447":{"dur":3,"text":"in some ways, but in some sense, actually I came"},"5450":{"dur":2,"text":"away from this match more impressed by"},"5452":{"dur":3,"text":"Garry Kasparov than I was by Deep Blue."},"5456":{"dur":3,"text":"Because here is human with our minds and Garry"},"5459":{"dur":2,"text":"was able to compete against this brute of a machine"},"5462":{"dur":2,"text":"on this very narrow domain of chess,"},"5464":{"dur":2,"text":"but of course, Garry can also speak three"},"5466":{"dur":3,"text":"languages, drive cars and even do things like"},"5470":{"dur":1,"text":"tie his shoelaces."},"5471":{"dur":3,"text":"And obviously, this is impossible for a"},"5475":{"dur":2,"text":"mainframe computer, but that's not only..."},"5477":{"dur":1,"text":"Things like driving cars, these are really"},"5479":{"dur":2,"text":"out of the domain but the interesting thing"},"5481":{"dur":1,"text":"about Deep Blue was it couldn't even do"},"5483":{"dur":3,"text":"something strictly simpler, like play noughts\nand crosses,"},"5487":{"dur":2,"text":"without being totally re-programmed."},"5489":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's nothing in the Deep Blue software"},"5492":{"dur":1,"text":"or the Deep Blue system that will allow it to"},"5494":{"dur":1,"text":"generalise to anything other than this"},"5495":{"dur":3,"text":"narrow domain that it had been pre-programmed for."},"5499":{"dur":2,"text":"So in some sense, we don't really view this"},"5501":{"dur":1,"text":"as true intelligence."},"5503":{"dur":1,"text":"And probably even the creators of the system"},"5505":{"dur":3,"text":"would also probably agree with that."},"5510":{"dur":1,"text":"So instead of that, we think about intelligence"},"5512":{"dur":2,"text":"in this very generalised fashion and in fact,"},"5515":{"dur":3,"text":"we think of intelligence in the framework of"},"5518":{"dur":2,"text":"what's called reinforcement learning."},"5520":{"dur":1,"text":"I just want to briefly describe to you what"},"5522":{"dur":3,"text":"reinforcement learning is in this simple schematic."},"5526":{"dur":2,"text":"So on the left hand side here, we have the"},"5529":{"dur":3,"text":"AI system; we call them agents at DeepMind."},"5533":{"dur":3,"text":"And this agent finds itself in some kind of an"},"5536":{"dur":2,"text":"environment and it's trying to achieve a goal"},"5538":{"dur":1,"text":"in that environment."},"5540":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, that environment could be the real world"},"5542":{"dur":1,"text":"or it could be a virtual environment;"},"5544":{"dur":1,"text":"it doesn't matter."},"5545":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, the agent only interacts with the environment\nin two ways."},"5548":{"dur":2,"text":"So the first way is that it gets observations"},"5551":{"dur":2,"text":"about the environment through its sensory apparatus"},"5554":{"dur":2,"text":"and we normally use vision but you could use"},"5557":{"dur":2,"text":"other sensory modalities."},"5559":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the key thing is these observations are"},"5562":{"dur":3,"text":"always noisy and incomplete so it's not like"},"5565":{"dur":1,"text":"a game of chess where you know the full"},"5566":{"dur":2,"text":"state of the board at all moments in time."},"5569":{"dur":3,"text":"The real world is much more messy and complex\nthan that."},"5572":{"dur":2,"text":"There are many things you cannot directly observe."},"5574":{"dur":2,"text":"So the agent system is built from the ground up"},"5577":{"dur":5,"text":"to deal with this noisy, unexpected, uncertain\nenvironment."},"5582":{"dur":2,"text":"And the first job of the agent system is to"},"5585":{"dur":2,"text":"build the best approximate model it can of the"},"5588":{"dur":3,"text":"world out there, based on these noisy, incomplete\nobservations."},"5592":{"dur":2,"text":"And to update that model every time a new"},"5594":{"dur":2,"text":"observation comes in."},"5596":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, once the agent has a model of the world,"},"5599":{"dur":3,"text":"what it does with it is uses it to make plans."},"5602":{"dur":2,"text":"So it can use the model of the world to roll"},"5605":{"dur":2,"text":"plans forward, imagine plans forward about what"},"5607":{"dur":1,"text":"actions it could take and what would be the"},"5609":{"dur":2,"text":"consequences of those actions."},"5611":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, depending on how much time the agent has"},"5613":{"dur":2,"text":"to think, it can make and use this model to run"},"5616":{"dur":1,"text":"various simulations about what will happen"},"5618":{"dur":2,"text":"and then the job of the agent system ultimately"},"5620":{"dur":3,"text":"is it pick the best action that will get it closest"},"5623":{"dur":3,"text":"towards its goal from the set of available"},"5627":{"dur":3,"text":"actions available to it at that moment in time."},"5630":{"dur":2,"text":"Once it's decided what that action is, it outputs"},"5632":{"dur":2,"text":"that action and that action may or may not make"},"5635":{"dur":1,"text":"a change to the environment and then that"},"5637":{"dur":2,"text":"drives a new observation and this goes around"},"5640":{"dur":2,"text":"in a cycle in real time."},"5643":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, although this diagram is very simple,"},"5646":{"dur":3,"text":"actually there is a lot of hidden complexity behind"},"5650":{"dur":2,"text":"this diagram and very complex research"},"5653":{"dur":1,"text":"questions that need to be solved."},"5655":{"dur":2,"text":"But the interesting thing is that we know that if"},"5657":{"dur":2,"text":"you could solve everything in this diagram,"},"5659":{"dur":1,"text":"and I\u2019ve just explained to you, that would be"},"5661":{"dur":4,"text":"sufficient for intelligence, for true general\nintelligence."},"5665":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reason we know that is because this is"},"5667":{"dur":1,"text":"how biological systems learn."},"5669":{"dur":4,"text":"All animals, especially all mammals including humans"},"5674":{"dur":2,"text":"learn with reinforcement learning."},"5676":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's actually the dopamine neurons in"},"5680":{"dur":2,"text":"the brain, the dopamine system that implements"},"5683":{"dur":3,"text":"a form of reinforcement learning called TD learning."},"5689":{"dur":2,"text":"The second thing that we are kind of committed"},"5692":{"dur":2,"text":"to in our approach with DeepMind was this"},"5694":{"dur":4,"text":"idea of embody cognition or situated cognition."},"5698":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the idea that to have a truly thinking"},"5701":{"dur":5,"text":"machine, it needs to be embedded within a"},"5706":{"dur":2,"text":"sensory motor data stream."},"5709":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, usually when people talk about embody cognition,"},"5712":{"dur":2,"text":"they start, if they commit to that and agree"},"5715":{"dur":1,"text":"with that approach, then they usually start"},"5717":{"dur":3,"text":"working directly on robots acting in the real world."},"5720":{"dur":1,"text":"But we wanted to avoid that because robots"},"5722":{"dur":2,"text":"are very expensive, they're slow to use and in"},"5725":{"dur":1,"text":"fact, you end up spending all your time,"},"5727":{"dur":1,"text":"if you have ever talked to a roboticist,"},"5728":{"dur":2,"text":"sort of working on the soldering irons and trying"},"5731":{"dur":2,"text":"to get the server motors working rather than"},"5733":{"dur":3,"text":"actually concentrating on the intelligence algorithms."},"5737":{"dur":2,"text":"So in fact, we decided to start with virtual"},"5740":{"dur":3,"text":"environments and specifically to use games."},"5745":{"dur":3,"text":"My previous background was in games so we knew"},"5748":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot about games and games systems, and were"},"5750":{"dur":2,"text":"able to adapt them to our needs."},"5752":{"dur":1,"text":"But they're actually the perfect platform for"},"5754":{"dur":2,"text":"developing and testing AI algorithms."},"5756":{"dur":2,"text":"So there are obviously thousands of games out there"},"5758":{"dur":1,"text":"of varying complexity."},"5760":{"dur":2,"text":"They\u2019ve been built to be challenging to humans"},"5762":{"dur":3,"text":"and there's no testing bias because we as the"},"5766":{"dur":2,"text":"algorithm developers didn't develop these games;"},"5768":{"dur":3,"text":"these games were not developed for AI algorithms,"},"5772":{"dur":1,"text":"they were developed for humans."},"5774":{"dur":2,"text":"Of course, we can increase the gradation of"},"5777":{"dur":2,"text":"difficulty of the games we tackle to match very"},"5779":{"dur":2,"text":"closely with the cutting edge of where we are"},"5782":{"dur":2,"text":"with our algorithms."},"5785":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you use games and virtual environments"},"5787":{"dur":4,"text":"in a proper way, this can be just as sort of"},"5792":{"dur":2,"text":"valid as using real robots in the real world"},"5794":{"dur":3,"text":"because they have rich data streams,"},"5798":{"dur":2,"text":"in this case for games and their pixels,"},"5800":{"dur":2,"text":"high-dimensional rich data streams and you've"},"5802":{"dur":3,"text":"also got to process what\u2019s going on there and"},"5805":{"dur":2,"text":"then make a decision about what action to take"},"5808":{"dur":3,"text":"ultimately, to get you towards a particular goal,"},"5811":{"dur":1,"text":"whatever the goal of that game is."},"5813":{"dur":2,"text":"So we call these kinds of agents that we train"},"5815":{"dur":2,"text":"at DeepMind, End-to-end agents."},"5818":{"dur":2,"text":"So they start all the way from the raw pixels"},"5821":{"dur":2,"text":"and they end up making a decision about what"},"5824":{"dur":1,"text":"action to take."},"5825":{"dur":2,"text":"So with that entire stack of problems."},"5829":{"dur":2,"text":"So I\u2019m going to show you a couple of fun videos"},"5831":{"dur":3,"text":"of these agents at work, but before I do that,"},"5835":{"dur":2,"text":"I just want to be very clear to you what you're"},"5837":{"dur":3,"text":"going to actually see and the significance of that."},"5841":{"dur":3,"text":"So we started off with classic 8Bit Atari games"},"5844":{"dur":2,"text":"from the eighties eras, so these are very iconic"},"5847":{"dur":2,"text":"games that many of you will be familiar with."},"5850":{"dur":2,"text":"But here the agent, the system only gets"},"5852":{"dur":1,"text":"raw pixels as inputs."},"5854":{"dur":3,"text":"So it gets about 30,000 numbers per frame,"},"5857":{"dur":2,"text":"per 50th of a second because the screen resolution"},"5860":{"dur":4,"text":"for Atari games was 200x150 pixels, roughly."},"5864":{"dur":3,"text":"The goal here that we give the machine is to"},"5867":{"dur":0,"text":"maximise scores."},"5868":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's a simple goal."},"5869":{"dur":2,"text":"And everything else is learned from scratch."},"5872":{"dur":2,"text":"So it has no idea what it's controlling, it has no"},"5874":{"dur":2,"text":"idea it's playing a game, of course."},"5877":{"dur":1,"text":"It has no idea about the rules of the game."},"5878":{"dur":4,"text":"All it's getting is these raw pixels as data."},"5883":{"dur":2,"text":"The last thing is we enforce this idea of"},"5885":{"dur":2,"text":"generality again, so a single system being able to"},"5888":{"dur":1,"text":"play all these different Atari games and there's"},"5890":{"dur":2,"text":"hundreds of them, out of the box."},"5893":{"dur":2,"text":"The same system without any changes."},"5898":{"dur":1,"text":"So I\u2019m going to show you a couple of videos."},"5900":{"dur":1,"text":"So the first one is Space Invaders, probably"},"5901":{"dur":3,"text":"the most iconic game on Atari and I\u2019m just"},"5905":{"dur":2,"text":"going to roll this video and so the first part of"},"5907":{"dur":2,"text":"the video shows you what the agent does when"},"5910":{"dur":1,"text":"it first sees this data stream."},"5912":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's literally the first time it's ever"},"5913":{"dur":2,"text":"seen these numbers, these 30,000 numbers and"},"5916":{"dur":2,"text":"you can see it's controlling the green spaceship"},"5919":{"dur":1,"text":"at the bottom of the screen and it's losing its"},"5921":{"dur":1,"text":"three lives immediately because it basically"},"5922":{"dur":3,"text":"has no idea what it's controlling in this world"},"5925":{"dur":1,"text":"or what it's supposed to do."},"5927":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, you leave this system playing on a"},"5929":{"dur":2,"text":"single GPU machine overnight; you come back the"},"5932":{"dur":3,"text":"next day and now just through self play, it\u2019s"},"5936":{"dur":1,"text":"now superhuman at the game."},"5937":{"dur":2,"text":"It's better than any human can play Space Invaders."},"5939":{"dur":1,"text":"So you'll notice it can't be killed anymore by"},"5941":{"dur":1,"text":"the enemy space invaders."},"5943":{"dur":1,"text":"It's worked out the pink mother ship at the top"},"5944":{"dur":1,"text":"there is worth the most points."},"5946":{"dur":1,"text":"It does these amazingly accurate shots to"},"5948":{"dur":2,"text":"get that and if you, those of you who played"},"5951":{"dur":2,"text":"Space Invaders, you'll remember they get faster"},"5953":{"dur":1,"text":"as there is less of them on the screen."},"5954":{"dur":2,"text":"If you watch carefully the last shot the spaceship"},"5957":{"dur":4,"text":"fires, so it makes this kind of predictive shot as"},"5961":{"dur":3,"text":"to where that space invader will be in time."},"5965":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's kind of implicitly modelled this world"},"5966":{"dur":3,"text":"accurately enough to understand what these,"},"5970":{"dur":3,"text":"the movements of these enemy ships will be doing"},"5973":{"dur":1,"text":"ahead of time."},"5977":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is my favourite video."},"5978":{"dur":2,"text":"It's called Breakout and in this game, I\u2019m just"},"5980":{"dur":1,"text":"going to show you more gradations of the"},"5982":{"dur":3,"text":"agent getting better over time and in this game,"},"5985":{"dur":1,"text":"you control the bat and the ball at the bottom"},"5987":{"dur":1,"text":"of the screen and you're trying to break through"},"5988":{"dur":2,"text":"this rainbow coloured brick wall brick by brick."},"5991":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is after just 100 games of play and you"},"5994":{"dur":2,"text":"can see the agent is pretty terrible at playing"},"5996":{"dur":1,"text":"this game; it's missing the ball most of the time"},"5998":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's starting to get the hang of the idea"},"6000":{"dur":2,"text":"it should be moving the bat towards the ball."},"6002":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, after 30 games it's about as good as"},"6005":{"dur":2,"text":"any human can play this, so it almost always"},"6007":{"dur":2,"text":"gets the ball back, even when it's coming back"},"6009":{"dur":1,"text":"at very fast angles."},"6011":{"dur":2,"text":"So we thought 'Great. You know, this is cool.'"},"6013":{"dur":2,"text":"But what happens if we just leave the machine"},"6015":{"dur":2,"text":"playing the game for another couple more hours,"},"6018":{"dur":1,"text":"a couple more hundred games."},"6019":{"dur":1,"text":"And to our surprise, what it did was it found"},"6020":{"dur":2,"text":"the optimal strategy was to dig a tunnel around"},"6023":{"dur":1,"text":"the left hand side here."},"6024":{"dur":2,"text":"You can see it sort of super human accuracy"},"6027":{"dur":2,"text":"getting the ball back around the side and"},"6029":{"dur":2,"text":"getting it behind the wall."},"6031":{"dur":3,"text":"The funny thing is that the amazing researchers"},"6035":{"dur":2,"text":"who created this algorithm, they're brilliant"},"6037":{"dur":1,"text":"researchers but they're not so good at playing"},"6039":{"dur":2,"text":"Atari and they didn't even know about that"},"6042":{"dur":2,"text":"strategy, so you know, maybe it's the first example"},"6044":{"dur":2,"text":"there of something quite unusual where the"},"6047":{"dur":2,"text":"creators of a system were actually taught something"},"6049":{"dur":1,"text":"by their own system."},"6052":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is truly a general piece of technology"},"6056":{"dur":2,"text":"for learning algorithms, for literally the"},"6058":{"dur":2,"text":"limited domain of Atari and this work was"},"6061":{"dur":1,"text":"published on the front cover of Nature a couple"},"6062":{"dur":1,"text":"of months ago and you can

since?"},"6084":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, so we've sort of solved Atari eighties"},"6088":{"dur":2,"text":"games, these 2D games so now we need to introduce"},"6090":{"dur":2,"text":"a third dimension,

in"},"6098":{"dur":3,"text":"this little video clip, where the same algorithm you"},"6101":{"dur":3,"text":"saw solving the Atari, we just decided to give it"},"6104":{"dur":3,"text":"a new data
