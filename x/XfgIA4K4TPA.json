NICHOLS: Well,\nI think that there"},"2384":{"dur":2,"text":"are three main ways in which\ntechnologies now actually help"},"2386":{"dur":1,"text":"us in teaching and learning."},"2388":{"dur":2,"text":"Firstly, we've got unprecedented\naccess to information."},"2391":{"dur":2,"text":"So we can find almost anything\nwith a quick Google

library."},"2399":{"dur":2,"text":"We can search for anything\nfrom YouTube, anything."},"2401":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've got unprecedented\naccess, very, very easy"},"2404":{"dur":2,"text":"to find stuff, and also to\ndownload it and potentially"},"2406":{"dur":1,"text":"use it later on."},"2407":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Excellent."},"2408":{"dur":2,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: Secondly, we can\nquickly process and present"},"2411":{"dur":1,"text":"information."},"2412":{"dur":2,"text":"So we can actually put\ntogether our thoughts,"},"2414":{"dur":2,"text":"combine the thoughts of\nothers into new ways,"},"2416":{"dur":2,"text":"using the likes of\nWord, PowerPoint."},"2419":{"dur":2,"text":"For those who are more\nadvanced, possibly"},"2421":{"dur":1,"text":"videocasting or podcasting."},"2423":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's a whole lot\nof ways we can actually"},"2425":{"dur":3,"text":"bring together our ideas\nand see them in new ways."},"2428":{"dur":2,"text":"And we can also\ndiscuss information now"},"2430":{"dur":1,"text":"in ways that were\njust completely"},"2432":{"dur":2,"text":"unknown about 20 years ago."},"2434":{"dur":3,"text":"So the art effects and\nideas we put together"},"2437":{"dur":1,"text":"in our own documents\nare things we can now"},"2439":{"dur":3,"text":"share through the\nlikes of social media."},"2442":{"dur":1,"text":"And informal education\ntoo-- there's"},"2444":{"dur":1,"text":"now a lot of use of\nonline discussion forums."},"2446":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: So your point\nis, really, it's not just"},"2448":{"dur":2,"text":"a different or poorer\nalternative to things,"},"2450":{"dur":3,"text":"it actually opens a range\nof new and exciting options"},"2453":{"dur":1,"text":"that people can take\nto enhance their study."},"2455":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, we've got a\nwhole lot of widgets"},"2457":{"dur":1,"text":"here, so these\ninteractive tools."},"2458":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'd like to\nknow what you think"},"2461":{"dur":1,"text":"and how you're behaving online."},"2462":{"dur":2,"text":"So those should be\nappearing on your screen."},"2465":{"dur":3,"text":"We would like to know how\noften you use the internet when"},"2468":{"dur":2,"text":"you're studying,\nand how often do you"},"2470":{"dur":1,"text":"use the computer as a student."},"2472":{"dur":1,"text":"So those are some of\nthe ones that we're"},"2473":{"dur":0,"text":"going to be bringing up."},"2474":{"dur":1,"text":"But we've also got\nother questions"},"2476":{"dur":1,"text":"that we'd like to know."},"2477":{"dur":2,"text":"We'd like to know which\nthree success factors do"},"2479":{"dur":1,"text":"you think you need to work on."},"2481":{"dur":1,"text":"So you might want to\nhave a little think"},"2482":{"dur":2,"text":"about which of those\noptions you can look at."},"2485":{"dur":2,"text":"And which of the three main\napplications of the website"},"2487":{"dur":0,"text":"do you use as a student?"},"2488":{"dur":2,"text":"That could be very\ninteresting for us to know."},"2490":{"dur":2,"text":"And in terms of\ntechnology for education,"},"2493":{"dur":2,"text":"where you see yourself\nin terms of a scale,"},"2495":{"dur":2,"text":"so whether you think you're a\nbeginner, or whether you think"},"2498":{"dur":1,"text":"you're a little\nbit more confident."},"2499":{"dur":2,"text":"So we'd like to know the\nanswer to the questions."},"2501":{"dur":3,"text":"And we will be bringing those\ninto our discussion with Mark."},"2505":{"dur":2,"text":"So firstly, then,\nthis difference"},"2507":{"dur":2,"text":"between online and digital,\nwhat is the difference"},"2509":{"dur":1,"text":"then between those two aspects?"},"2511":{"dur":2,"text":"You've spoken a little bit\nabout accessing information"},"2513":{"dur":1,"text":"and how those are\ndifferent, but what would"},"2515":{"dur":1,"text":"you say the main difference is?"},"2516":{"dur":1,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: Well, I\nthink online actually"},"2518":{"dur":1,"text":"requires you to be\nconnected to the internet"},"2520":{"dur":1,"text":"to make the most of it."},"2521":{"dur":1,"text":"Digital, there's a\nwhole lot you can"},"2523":{"dur":1,"text":"do with a computer\nthat doesn't require"},"2524":{"dur":2,"text":"you to have internet\naccess whatsoever--"},"2527":{"dur":2,"text":"so the likes of using a word\nprocessor, of reading things"},"2529":{"dur":0,"text":"offline."},"2530":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a whole host\nof things that you"},"2532":{"dur":1,"text":"don't need to\nactually be physically"},"2533":{"dur":1,"text":"connected to the internet to do."},"2535":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's really important to hold\nboth of those things together,"},"2538":{"dur":2,"text":"because online\ndoesn't necessarily"},"2540":{"dur":2,"text":"mean, when we talk\nabout online education,"},"2542":{"dur":2,"text":"doesn't necessarily mean you\nhave to be online at all times."},"2545":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Now,\nour students who"},"2546":{"dur":1,"text":"are watching this,\nunsurprisingly perhaps,"},"2548":{"dur":2,"text":"are feeling quite confident\nwith their use of technology."},"2551":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: They're using their\ncomputers most of the time."},"2554":{"dur":2,"text":"So that could just be a\nbias in terms of the people"},"2556":{"dur":1,"text":"who've come along today."},"2557":{"dur":1,"text":"How accurate would\nyou say that is"},"2559":{"dur":2,"text":"as a representation of the\nOU population of students?"},"2562":{"dur":1,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: Ooh, I\ncouldn't say for sure,"},"2564":{"dur":1,"text":"but my understanding is\nthat most students are"},"2566":{"dur":2,"text":"very confident users\nof technology here."},"2568":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: The overwhelming\nthing they need to focus on"},"2570":{"dur":2,"text":"is focus, though, So\nunsurprisingly, we've"},"2573":{"dur":2,"text":"been talking a little bit\nabout that during the sessions."},"2576":{"dur":1,"text":"So that is all very interesting."},"2578":{"dur":1,"text":"So there are various\ntypes of technologies,"},"2580":{"dur":1,"text":"but you've said\nthat there are three"},"2582":{"dur":2,"text":"main ways in which digital tools\ncan help us in our learning."},"2584":{"dur":2,"text":"And you've spoken a\nlittle bit about accessing"},"2587":{"dur":1,"text":"some information."},"2588":{"dur":2,"text":"We spoke last week about some of\nthe sessions with the library,"},"2591":{"dur":1,"text":"and about procrastination,\nand about not"},"2592":{"dur":2,"text":"accessing too much information."},"2594":{"dur":3,"text":"So when is being digital helpful\nfor accessing information?"},"2598":{"dur":2,"text":"And how do you know when\nto start and when to stop?"},"2600":{"dur":1,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: Oh,\nit's a good question."},"2601":{"dur":3,"text":"I think digital-- if you did\na Google search for a subject"},"2605":{"dur":3,"text":"straight off, you'd tend to get\nthe most popular hits first."},"2608":{"dur":1,"text":"And they'll usually\nbe the most helpful."},"2610":{"dur":1,"text":"But when I do my\nown online study,"},"2612":{"dur":2,"text":"I tend to do a fairly\ngeneral search first,"},"2614":{"dur":2,"text":"just to get a view as\nto the breadth of ideas"},"2616":{"dur":1,"text":"that are out there."},"2617":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, gradually, I get\na sense of how to focus."},"2619":{"dur":1,"text":"But it does require\na bit of discipline"},"2621":{"dur":2,"text":"to eventually get to that\nstage where, OK, I now need"},"2623":{"dur":2,"text":"to start putting some\nideas aside and focusing"},"2625":{"dur":1,"text":"in on those that are\nreally of interest to me."},"2627":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Why would you say\nfocus is such an issue then?"},"2629":{"dur":1,"text":"Because people are saying\nthey struggle with that."},"2631":{"dur":1,"text":"And we've been speaking\nbefore with Georgina"},"2633":{"dur":2,"text":"about how to identify when\nyou need to do something,"},"2635":{"dur":1,"text":"when to stop procrastinating."},"2637":{"dur":1,"text":"But if you don't know\nwhat to focus on,"},"2638":{"dur":1,"text":"how do you know how\nto rein that focus in?"},"2640":{"dur":0,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: Yeah."},"2641":{"dur":2,"text":"I think, from a use of\ntechnology perspective,"},"2644":{"dur":1,"text":"focus is a little bit different."},"2646":{"dur":1,"text":"From a use of\ntechnology perspective,"},"2647":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd be inclined to\nclose down everything"},"2649":{"dur":1,"text":"except what I'm working."},"2650":{"dur":1,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: It's all\ntoo easy to be distracted"},"2652":{"dur":1,"text":"and to even distract\nyourself, by having"},"2654":{"dur":2,"text":"your email client

I'll often think,\noh, I'll just have those on."},"2674":{"dur":1,"text":"At least I'll know\nwhen something happens."},"2676":{"dur":1,"text":"And yet, it's so easy\nto become distracted,"},"2677":{"dur":2,"text":"because you've got all\nof this feed into things."},"2680":{"dur":2,"text":"And also there's, I\nguess, pressure to be"},"2683":{"dur":1,"text":"connected a lot of the time."},"2685":{"dur":2,"text":"So how would you advise\npeople, if they are focusing"},"2687":{"dur":3,"text":"on one thing, manage that\ndigital range of networks"},"2690":{"dur":1,"text":"to stop doing something?"},"2692":{"dur":2,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: Well, I think\nyou've always got control,"},"2694":{"dur":1,"text":"as a user, yourself."},"2695":{"dur":2,"text":"Another important

today,"},"2721":{"dur":0,"text":"so a key issue."},"2722":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a really good thing."},"2723":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think it's such a\nsimple piece of advice,"},"2725":{"dur":1,"text":"but it makes them massive,\nmassive difference,"},"2727":{"dur":2,"text":"because yeah, you would\njust be able to focus."},"2729":{"dur":2,"text":"But as you say, you can\nalso use digital tools"},"2732":{"dur":2,"text":"for collating, and presenting,\nand gathering information"},"2735":{"dur":2,"text":"What would some of\nyour advice be

can\nactually link through at,"},"3857":{"dur":2,"text":"for instance, something\nthat's in a DVD."},"3859":{"dur":2,"text":"You could link through to\nsomething that's in a book,"},"3862":{"dur":1,"text":"or something that you've\nheard in a lecture."},"3864":{"dur":3,"text":"So you might want to produce\na nice neat table, which I"},"3867":{"dur":1,"text":"haven't done

it"},"3874":{"dur":2,"text":"into a table, as opposed\nto a format like that be?"},"3877":{"dur":1,"text":"NIKKI HARLOW: Well,\nif I've got a question"},"3879":{"dur":3,"text":"on An Idea of

literature"},"3896":{"dur":3,"text":"of authority, and link her back,\nand then link aspects of her"},"3900":{"dur":0,"text":"text."},"3901":{"dur":2,"text":"So you might have different\nheadings,
