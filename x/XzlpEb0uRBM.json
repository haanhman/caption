I tend to use whole nutmeg rather than ground."},"46":{"dur":1,"text":"I find the flavour's a lot better."},"47":{"dur":2,"text":"The smell already is really, really good."},"49":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I rub the butter through the flour"},"51":{"dur":2,"text":"until we get a breadcrumb like texture."},"53":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we're going to add the liquid in."},"55":{"dur":3,"text":"So the yeast's gone all frothy and bubbly so we'll pour that straight in."},"59":{"dur":1,"text":"Got the egg in."},"60":{"dur":4,"text":"So now, using your hands, start working in the middle just to break the egg."},"64":{"dur":4,"text":"And then spin the bowl, more or less keeping your hand in the same place."},"68":{"dur":3,"text":"And just start working the flour into the liquid."},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"It will be sticky.

That's fantastic.  Straight away, it really hits you."},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"That nutmeg.

So we just fold the fruit in."},"161":{"dur":5,"text":"Bring that side over. Bring that side over, and then turn over."},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"And then once the fruit's into the dough we're going to start kneading it."},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"Don't worry at first.  The fruit will fall out, that's fine."},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"Just keep mopping it up with the dough."},"176":{"dur":2,"text":"And for kneading this, hold the dough at the front,"},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"pull it, push down with your fingers, and then where you've pushed that,"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"get the heel of your hand and push it through."},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"So you're stretching the dough."},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"We need to do this for two to three minutes."},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"To check that's done enough,"},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"just press it and it should spring back slightly."},"194":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to cut this into 12 pieces, and now we're ready to shape each one"},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"and get it onto the tray ready for proving."},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"The technique for rolling is to"},"202":{"dur":4,"text":"place the palm of your hand over the piece of dough and start to rotate."},"206":{"dur":4,"text":"Gradually cup your hand and push your thumb and little finger together at the bottom."},"211":{"dur":3,"text":"And that just pushes the dough in and we get a nice ball of dough."},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"Once we've done that, what we're going to do now"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"is leave these to double in size."},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"Cover them with a bit of cling film,"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"and all I've done with this is rubbed a bit of butter."},"223":{"dur":4,"text":"You could use oil.

Stir that until the honey melts into the butter."},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to leave that to sit while the buns cook."},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"And as soon as they come out we use a pastry brush"},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"and we'll get that brushed on the top."},"300":{"dur":4,"text":"Beautiful.  Absolutely spot-on. Really smells good."},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"Whilst they're still hot we need to get the topping on."},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"So there you have it.
