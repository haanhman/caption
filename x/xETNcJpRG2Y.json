nothing comparing\nthe distances, here,"},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"so I emigrated to Delft, which is inland."},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"I was born on the beach,\nalmost, in Scheveningen."},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"And I studied physics\nthere for seven years,"},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"but I was not a very good student."},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was the hippy times,"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"so I was distracted a\nbit from my studying."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, I became a painter."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"I never got my diploma of physics."},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"I became a painter; I\npainted for many years."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"I got a studio in Delft."},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm still working there."},"419":{"dur":4,"text":"So, in artistry, about 35\nyears I'm working there."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"Then, indeed, like Chris told you that,"},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"in 1980, there landed an idea in my head"},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"that I wanted to build a flying saucer,"},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"which could really fly."},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"And the thing was black."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"It had a diameter of four meters."},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was just plastic\nfilled with helium."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"But I launched it on a\nday that was a bit hazy."},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"The weather was a bit hazy."},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"And because of the contrast with the sky,"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"you couldn't see any depth in there."},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"And so people just saw a disc,\ntraveling through the sky."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"But you cannot estimate how high it is."},"464":{"dur":0,"text":"(laughing)"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"If you think it's very high,\nthat many people thought,"},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"then it's very big, and it goes fast."},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, that was on television,"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was famous for a\nfew months in my country."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"(laughing)"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"And after that, I was not\nable to paint anymore."},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"Because, I tasted, more or less,"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"of attention, which was wider."},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think the motivation to stop painting"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"was a little bit vulgar."},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"Asking for attention."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, I start making machines."},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"And that resulted in a\nmachine which could paint."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"So I didn't have to paint anymore."},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"515":{"dur":4,"text":"It was a spray gun, which\nis sensitive for light."},"519":{"dur":4,"text":"So if there is light on\nit, then it stops painting."},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"But as soon as dark, it\nstarts spraying paint."},"529":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was mounted on a\nwall, and the light cell"},"534":{"dur":4,"text":"was at the end of a tube, so\nwhen traveling across the wall,"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"it would react on all the lights"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"which is in front of the wall."},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"So, if there was a person\nwith a white shirt,"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"when it would see the white shirt,"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"it would close the spray gun,"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"so that would be white there, as well."},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"But if a black person\ncomes by, it was black."},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the result is that, when\ntravelling along the wall,"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"it would paint a photographic painting"},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"from all the objects which\nwere before the wall."},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"So, a few years, I lived on that machine."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, because I took it on my car"},"581":{"dur":4,"text":"and I traveled it to festivals,\nand I demonstrated that."},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"And then there came this, in the meantime,"},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"I was a writer, and in\n1990, I wrote a column"},"594":{"dur":4,"text":"about sort of skeletons,\nwhich would walk on beaches."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"And these skeletons,"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"they would gather sands to build up dunes."},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"Because Al Gore told us that\nthe sea level would rise,"},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"and that in a few decades,\nHolland would disappear,"},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"because of this, the rising sea level."},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, the basic material\nfor that skeletons,"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"everybody knows this in Holland."},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"Since it's the color of cheese."},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"We use it for power lines in houses."},"640":{"dur":4,"text":"And especially, my getting\nto know this kind of tube,"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"it was about when I was 11 years old,"},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"I had a sort of hobby."},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"All the Dutch people in\nthe audience, there's some,"},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"know what I'm doing."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"Because all Dutch boys do this."},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"So imagine there's an\nopen window in the back."},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, I'll try to do this safe."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"(laughter)"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, sorry for you."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"(hissing exhale)"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"(laughter)"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"That's how it all started."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"And so this kind of nice tube,"},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"it's very cheap, so you\ndon't have to be rich"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"to build big skeletons,\nand these skeletons,"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"they turn out to walk."},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"And while working with this kind of tube,"},"711":{"dur":4,"text":"I realized that I,\nbecause I restrict myself"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"to this material, I'm doing the same thing"},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"as the real creator."},"723":{"dur":4,"text":"Because, the real creator\nrestricted himself also,"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"very much, in the choice of his materials."},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"He just used protein to build us."},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"You can make skin with protein, eyes,"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"everything you can make with protein,"},"740":{"dur":4,"text":"and you wouldn't say that\nif you put an egg in the pan"},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"to fry it, this is a clumsy\nmaterial, you wouldn't say that"},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"that is the ultimate\nconstruction material for life."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"But still, if you have millions of years,"},"759":{"dur":4,"text":"and you try again and again,\nand that's what protein does."},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"It renews itself all the time."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"It tries again and again."},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"Then the result is not bad."},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"The way we're sitting here,"},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"after all those billions of years."},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"I try to do the same."},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"I restrict myself just\nto this kind of tube,"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"and I try to make\neverything with this tube,"},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"and I discovered that\nthis restriction, in fact,"},"789":{"dur":4,"text":"brings me further than I\nwould, by all the stuff I need,"},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"which I come up with."},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"So I will explain that later."},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"First, I wanna get in the mood"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"for Strandbeest by showing a video."},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"And you get to here some\nGustav Marlow music with it."},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"So I hope you get in the right mood."},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"(spacey instrumental music)"},"1040":{"dur":3,"text":"Now here, the animal drives\na pin into the ground,"},"1043":{"dur":3,"text":"to anchor itself for a coming storm."},"1048":{"dur":3,"text":"So, during the generations,\nthe Strandbeests,"},"1054":{"dur":1,"text":"oh, can we stop here?"},"1063":{"dur":0,"text":"Thank you."},"1065":{"dur":4,"text":"So, during the generations,\nevery time I try to, ah,"},"1071":{"dur":3,"text":"to find a new aspect of\nsurviving on the beach."},"1076":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the big dangers, for instance,"},"1078":{"dur":2,"text":"are the storms, the wind silences,"},"1082":{"dur":4,"text":"the sands, the sand always\ncreeps into the joints,"},"1087":{"dur":3,"text":"and also the water, of course."},"1090":{"dur":2,"text":"And every time I try\nsomething new, a new method,"},"1093":{"dur":2,"text":"you could see this as\nthe evolution of methods"},"1095":{"dur":2,"text":"that these animals survive,"},"1098":{"dur":3,"text":"better weather these circumstances."},"1101":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I just use this kind of tube to, ah,"},"1108":{"dur":2,"text":"as a sort of principle, you, ah,"},"1111":{"dur":2,"text":"you couldn't call it a religion."},"1113":{"dur":3,"text":"It's gone too far, but I\ndon't wanna buy everything."},"1117":{"dur":2,"text":"I just wanna have just a bunch of tubes"},"1120":{"dur":2,"text":"and then make the things."},"1123":{"dur":2,"text":"And that, the consequence of that,"},"1125":{"dur":4,"text":"is that when I have to\nplan, and I go to my studio,"},"1130":{"dur":2,"text":"and I want to realize that plan,"},"1132":{"dur":2,"text":"that usually doesn't succeed."},"1137":{"dur":3,"text":"Because the tubes, they protest."},"1140":{"dur":3,"text":"They don't wanna do what I wanna do."},"1143":{"dur":3,"text":"They always want something else."},"1146":{"dur":4,"text":"And the next day, I go to my studio again,"},"1151":{"dur":3,"text":"and then I have, again, I have a new idea,"},"1154":{"dur":3,"text":"but that's based on the\nexperiences of the day before,"},"1157":{"dur":3,"text":"with the tubes, and somehow, these tubes,"},"1161":{"dur":3,"text":"they push me in another way, every time."},"1165":{"dur":3,"text":"And in fact, most of\nmy plans don't succeed,"},"1171":{"dur":2,"text":"without all the plans of the tubes."},"1174":{"dur":4,"text":"And the roads, the path\nis very unpredictable,"},"1178":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's very capricious,"},"1180":{"dur":2,"text":"and you don't know where to go."},"1182":{"dur":4,"text":"And in the end, you could say\nthat I didn't make the animal,"},"1188":{"dur":2,"text":"or I didn't design the animal,"},"1191":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's done by the tubes."},"1194":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'm surprised, myself,\nhow beautiful the beasts are."},"1200":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't work on beauty."},"1202":{"dur":1,"text":"It's done by the tubes."},"1204":{"dur":2,"text":"So, people praise me for\nthe beauty of the beasts,"},"1207":{"dur":2,"text":"but in fact, I don't feel\nreally responsible for that."},"1210":{"dur":2,"text":"It's done by the tubes."},"1212":{"dur":3,"text":"I just did what the tube dictated to me."},"1216":{"dur":2,"text":"I would like to tell you"},"1218":{"dur":3,"text":"about the reproduction of the beasts."},"1225":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, my first ideas of\nreproduction was, of course,"},"1229":{"dur":3,"text":"they I would feed tubes to the animals,"},"1232":{"dur":2,"text":"and then they would work on it,"},"1235":{"dur":4,"text":"and make an animal, which\ncould also make another animal,"},"1239":{"dur":3,"text":"and I would certainly succeed doing that,"},"1242":{"dur":3,"text":"but it would take a\nfew more million years."},"1245":{"dur":2,"text":"I've only 20 years to do this,"},"1248":{"dur":3,"text":"but it turned out that the Strandbeests,"},"1251":{"dur":3,"text":"they were already reproducing,"},"1254":{"dur":2,"text":"and they did it behind my back."},"1256":{"dur":2,"text":"And I will tell you how that happened."},"1259":{"dur":2,"text":"Before I can tell you that,"},"1261":{"dur":3,"text":"I have to tell something\nabout the anatomy,"},"1264":{"dur":0,"text":"anatomy?"},"1265":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, of the beasts, so the Strandbeests,"},"1268":{"dur":2,"text":"they have a sort of backbone,"},"1270":{"dur":3,"text":"which makes circular movements like this."},"1278":{"dur":3,"text":"And this circular movement is transformed"},"1281":{"dur":4,"text":"to a walking movement, written\nby the pencil down there."},"1286":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's done by all\nthese tubes in between."},"1289":{"dur":4,"text":"Now you see, as soon as the\npencil is on the ground,"},"1294":{"dur":3,"text":"it draws, more or less, a straight line."},"1297":{"dur":3,"text":"I hope you can see this in the back."},"1301":{"dur":1,"text":"It draws, more or less, a straight line,"},"1303":{"dur":4,"text":"and that means that the animal,\nit stays on the same level."},"1308":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn't toss up and down like we,"},"1310":{"dur":3,"text":"when we walk, we always go\nup and down a little bit."},"1313":{"dur":3,"text":"But the special way of Strandbeest walking"},"1317":{"dur":2,"text":"is that they stay on the same level."},"1320":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's because of\nthe shape of this curve."},"1323":{"dur":3,"text":"Because of the straight bottom, there."},"1327":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, the shape of that\ncurve is very much depending"},"1331":{"dur":4,"text":"on the length of the\ntubes between the backbone"},"1335":{"dur":1,"text":"and the pencil."},"1337":{"dur":2,"text":"If you have another proportion of length,"},"1340":{"dur":3,"text":"then you get a totally\ndifferent curve there."},"1343":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, when I started\nthis, I didn't know which"},"1347":{"dur":3,"text":"proportion of length I\nneeded to get this curve."},"1350":{"dur":2,"text":"That's why I wrote a computer program,"},"1353":{"dur":2,"text":"which has this model in it."},"1357":{"dur":3,"text":"So when, with a given\nproportion of length,"},"1360":{"dur":3,"text":"you could predict the shape of the curve."},"1366":{"dur":2,"text":"But still, there's so many possibilities"},"1369":{"dur":2,"text":"that if I would let pass\nall the possibilities"},"1371":{"dur":3,"text":"in the computer, it\nwasn't very progressive."},"1376":{"dur":2,"text":"It was an Atari computer."},"1379":{"dur":2,"text":"You're too young to know what that is."},"1382":{"dur":0,"text":"(laughter)"},"1383":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's a, the Atari computer, it's,"},"1387":{"dur":2,"text":"if I let pass all the possibilities,"},"1390":{"dur":2,"text":"it would be on for 100,000 years."},"1392":{"dur":1,"text":"So I, maybe, with a good computer,"},"1394":{"dur":2,"text":"can bring it back to 100 years."},"1396":{"dur":2,"text":"But still, it's too long."},"1399":{"dur":4,"text":"That's why I needed to use\nthe principle of evolution,"},"1404":{"dur":3,"text":"in there, and that worked in a way"},"1407":{"dur":4,"text":"that were born 1,500 legs\nlike this in the Atari,"},"1414":{"dur":3,"text":"and they all had random lengths of tubes."},"1417":{"dur":3,"text":"So you get 1,500 different\nshapes of curves,"},"1422":{"dur":2,"text":"the pencil draws all kinds of curves,"},"1424":{"dur":3,"text":"1,500 different ones, and\nnone of them is this one."},"1428":{"dur":2,"text":"The chance is very small."},"1431":{"dur":2,"text":"But some of these 1,500 curves,"},"1434":{"dur":3,"text":"they are lookalikes of this curve."},"1437":{"dur":2,"text":"I knew because they have\na sort of resemblance."},"1439":{"dur":3,"text":"And those are selected by the computer"},"1444":{"dur":3,"text":"and they get the privilege\nto keep on living."},"1447":{"dur":2,"text":"The other ones, they die."},"1450":{"dur":3,"text":"And they get, apart from\nthe privilege of living,"},"1453":{"dur":2,"text":"they also get the\nprivilege of multiplying."},"1456":{"dur":2,"text":"That means that the tubes are copied"},"1458":{"dur":4,"text":"and reassembled to 1,500 new combinations."},"1462":{"dur":2,"text":"In the

are used"},"1536":{"dur":2,"text":"for the reproduction for the Strandbeest."},"1538":{"dur":3,"text":"(laughter)"},"1541":{"dur":3,"text":"So they're infected with these DNA

out."},"1910":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, what you've\ncreated here is a muscle."},"1914":{"dur":3,"text":"A muscle is nothing but an\nobject which becomes longer"},"1917":{"dur":2,"text":"or shorter on

this."},"1949":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if I blow air in here."},"1951":{"dur":3,"text":"(hissing exhalations)"},"1956":{"dur":3,"text":"The air goes in here,\nand comes out at here."},"1959":{"dur":2,"text":"But, if I push in this piston here,"},"1965":{"dur":1,"text":"it's blocked."},"1966":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is a valve, open, closed."},"1971":{"dur":3,"text":"This, so this is, you could\nsee this as a nerve cell."},"1974":{"dur":4,"text":"Which, if it opens, then\nthe muscle is stretched."},"1978":{"dur":2,"text":"If it closes, it comes back."},"1981":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, usually, I have an\nelastic attached to it,"},"1984":{"dur":1,"text":"which pulls it back."},"1985":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, these nerve cells,\nyou can regulate

quite, can you see it in the back?"},"2004":{"dur":3,"text":"So if I blow air in\nhere, the valve closes."},"2008":{"dur":2,"text":"And no air comes out of here."},"2011":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if you see this as the input,"},"2016":{"dur":2,"text":"and this as the output,"},"2018":{"dur":4,"text":"then the output is\nopposite from the input."},"2023":{"dur":2,"text":"Everybody says okay."},"2025":{"dur":2,"text":"Yes, output and input,\nI know what that is."},"2028":{"dur":3,"text":"I will say, I wanna make\nit very clear to you,"},"2032":{"dur":2,"text":"if you see this as a person,"},"2035":{"dur":2,"text":"this is a person, and this is the mouth,"},"2038":{"dur":2,"text":"and this is the ear,"},"2040":{"dur":3,"text":"the mouth says the opposite\nfrom what it hears."},"2043":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if it hears there's air,"},"2047":{"dur":2,"text":"the mouth says \"no, there's no air\"."},"2050":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's why I call this a

\"yes\" to you, so you hear \"yes\"."},"2073":{"dur":2,"text":"You are a liar, what would you say to her?"},"2076":{"dur":2,"text":"(unintelligible

\"yes\""},"2086":{"dur":1,"text":"and you say \"no\" to her."},"2088":{"dur":1,"text":"You hear \"no\"; what do you say to me?"},"2090":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Woman In Audience] Yes."},"2091":{"dur":1,"text":"- And I hear \"yes\", and I say \"no\"."},"2092":{"dur":2,"text":"So in this conversation of three liars,"},"2095":{"dur":1,"text":"I changed my opinion."},"2098":{"dur":2,"text":"That's what you have with\nan uneven number of liars,"},"2100":{"dur":2,"text":"you keep changing your opinion,"},"2103":{"dur":2,"text":"and you have a so-called

you."},"2127":{"dur":1,"text":"This is you."},"2129":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is me."},"2130":{"dur":3,"text":"And let's see what the liars\nhave to tell to each other."},"2134":{"dur":3,"text":"(mechanical clicking)"},"2142":{"dur":4,"text":"So they're saying \"yes\"\nand \"no\", like we did."},"2146":{"dur":3,"text":"And as you know, you\ncan see a \"yes\" as a one"},"2152":{"dur":1,"text":"and a \"no\" as a zero."},"2154":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, what you can do with these liars"},"2157":{"dur":4,"text":"is to switch zeros and ones,\njust like in a computer."},"2162":{"dur":3,"text":"And in fact, what you\nsee here is the beginning"},"2165":{"dur":2,"text":"of the brain of the Strandbeests."},"2169":{"dur":2,"text":"So they can take their positions."},"2171":{"dur":1,"text":"So I have this dream"},"2173":{"dur":3,"text":"that these animals are migration animals."},"2177":{"dur":4,"text":"Let's say that there's a\nbeast standing in Kijkduin,"},"2183":{"dur":3,"text":"this little village, along\nthe coast I was born,"},"2186":{"dur":4,"text":"and the wind is southwest,\nit walks over the hard part"},"2191":{"dur":2,"text":"of the beach, along the coast, which is,"},"2193":{"dur":2,"text":"because the wind is parallel to the coast,"},"2196":{"dur":4,"text":"and it goes to Scheveningen,\nthat's another town."},"2200":{"dur":4,"text":"It goes, with it's ski poles,\nwhich are driven by pneumatics"},"2206":{"dur":3,"text":"in these bottles, on the soft sands,"},"2209":{"dur":4,"text":"and it waits until the wind\nhas turned 180 degrees."},"2216":{"dur":1,"text":"It might take a few weeks,"},"2218":{"dur":2,"text":"but these animals are incredibly patient."},"2220":{"dur":1,"text":"They don't care about time."},"2222":{"dur":2,"text":"They just wait until\nthe wind is northeast,"},"2225":{"dur":4,"text":"then they go with the ski\npoles, to the hard sand again,"},"2229":{"dur":3,"text":"catch up the winds, and\nwalk back to Kijkduin."},"2232":{"dur":3,"text":"So I see them as migration animals."},"2236":{"dur":3,"text":"And I want them to do this\none day, on their own."},"2239":{"dur":2,"text":"So they have to take their own decision,"},"2242":{"dur":3,"text":"to know when the wind is southwest,"},"2246":{"dur":3,"text":"they have to go to Scheveningen,\nthey have step counters."},"2249":{"dur":3,"text":"So a step counter is nothing but a pump,"},"2252":{"dur":1,"text":"which is connected to the legs,"},"2254":{"dur":3,"text":"which pumps, with every step,\nit pumps a little bit air"},"2258":{"dur":4,"text":"into a bottle, so the pressure\nwill increase while walking,"},"2263":{"dur":4,"text":"and once the pressure\nexceeds a certain level,"},"2268":{"dur":2,"text":"it knows it has arrived in Scheveningen,"},"2270":{"dur":2,"text":"so it goes, with its ski sticks,"},"2273":{"dur":3,"text":"on the soft sands and waits again."},"2276":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the idea."},"2278":{"dur":2,"text":"Of course, they need senses."},"2281":{"dur":2,"text":"And they need to feel the winds,"},"2283":{"dur":2,"text":"how strong the wind is,\nthe direction of the wind."},"2286":{"dur":4,"text":"They also feel the hardness of the sand."},"2290":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a sand-feeler."},"2295":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, it used to be, a sand-feeler."},"2297":{"dur":2,"text":"So, there are two pins here."},"2300":{"dur":3,"text":"As soon as it, it beats on soft sand,"},"2305":{"dur":2,"text":"then nothing will happen."},"2307":{"dur":2,"text":"But on hard sand, this is pushed up,"},"2310":{"dur":2,"text":"and then they know they\nare closer to the sea."},"2312":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is how they navigate."},"2313":{"dur":2,"text":"You must imagine that, as\nanimals, they are blind"},"2316":{"dur":4,"text":"and they are deaf, and they\ndon't know where they are"},"2320":{"dur":2,"text":"on the beach; they\ncan't even hear the sea,"},"2323":{"dur":1,"text":"so they don't know\nwhich direction that is."},"2324":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is how they can,\nmore or less, find out."},"2327":{"dur":3,"text":"And based on the other information,"},"2331":{"dur":4,"text":"the brains have to take\nthe decision to what to do."},"2337":{"dur":3,"text":"To decide to go to the hard sand or not,"},"2341":{"dur":1,"text":"to wait, all these kind of things,"},"2342":{"dur":2,"text":"they have to decide on their own."},"2345":{"dur":3,"text":"And so they also need a water-feeler."},"2357":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the water-feeler."},"2360":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, this tube, this hose,\nit goes over the ground"},"2365":{"dur":4,"text":"to about this height, and it\nsucks in air all the time."},"2370":{"dur":2,"text":"So, (sucking inhalations)."},"2373":{"dur":2,"text":"And then it arrives to the sea,"},"2375":{"dur":2,"text":"and it swallows the water,\nand feels the resistance"},"2378":{"dur":2,"text":"of the water, and then\nsomething else has to happen,"},"2381":{"dur":1,"text":"otherwise the animal's gonna drown,"},"2383":{"dur":3,"text":"so they have to, a nerve\ncell has to switch over,"},"2386":{"dur":2,"text":"and then they have to use their ski poles"},"2388":{"dur":4,"text":"to run as fast as they\ncan, out of the sea again."},"2393":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, we gonna try the\nwater-feeler right now, here."},"2398":{"dur":2,"text":"We need a very brave person."},"2405":{"dur":4,"text":"I know a very brave person;\nhe is sitting over there."},"2410":{"dur":2,"text":"Opp is a brave person, right?"},"2412":{"dur":2,"text":"Opp, would you come and help me?"},"2416":{"dur":0,"text":"(applause)"},"2417":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes."},"2421":{"dur":1,"text":"Will you hold this?"},"2422":{"dur":1,"text":"- Ah, yeah, I think I can."},"2424":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"2425":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, what I'm gonna do is,"},"2427":{"dur":2,"text":"I have a bottle of water somewhere."},"2432":{"dur":1,"text":"It's here, yeah."},"2434":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is the sea, and\nI'm gonna put the hose"},"2437":{"dur":3,"text":"into the water, and it should\nhappen, something, there."},"2440":{"dur":3,"text":"I think I'm gonna put the liars on it,"},"2444":{"dur":3,"text":"so as soon as the hose goes in here,"},"2448":{"dur":3,"text":"you should hear the liars rattling."},"2451":{"dur":2,"text":"Saying \"yes\" and \"no\"."},"2453":{"dur":1,"text":"Are you okay?"},"2455":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Opp] Yeah, so far."},"2456":{"dur":2,"text":"- So far, so good."},"2458":{"dur":1,"text":"Where are the liars?"},"2460":{"dur":1,"text":"There."},"2461":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Opp] That's it, yes. (muttering)"},"2462":{"dur":2,"text":"(laughter)"},"2467":{"dur":3,"text":"- So, we're gonna connect it somewhere."},"2472":{"dur":0,"text":"Here."},"2477":{"dur":1,"text":"So, let me see."},"2479":{"dur":1,"text":"- These are the liars, here?"},"2480":{"dur":3,"text":"- Those are the liars, and I have to do..."},"2487":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes?"},"2488":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay."},"2489":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, Opp, I don't want you to get hurt."},"2494":{"dur":2,"text":"(laughter)"},"2496":{"dur":1,"text":"- Alright."},"2497":{"dur":1,"text":"- You're brave enough."},"2500":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, I'm going to open the valve, now,"},"2503":{"dur":2,"text":"and it starts moving in your hand."},"2506":{"dur":3,"text":"So, and then I'll look\nfor my, the sea, here."},"2512":{"dur":2,"text":"So, all ready, all set now?"},"2515":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"2517":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, here we go."},"2520":{"dur":1,"text":"(mechanical clicking)"},"2521":{"dur":4,"text":"Oh, it's already feeling\nwater, and it shouldn't."},"2527":{"dur":1,"text":"So now it comes to the sea."},"2529":{"dur":1,"text":"Here it comes."},"2536":{"dur":0,"text":"(quick rattling)"},"2537":{"dur":1,"text":"And it felt the

rattling)"},"2552":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes."},"2553":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"2555":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay, Opp."},"2556":{"dur":0,"text":"- Fantastic."},"2557":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well done."},"2558":{"dur":2,"text":"(applause)"},"2573":{"dur":4,"text":"So, usually I start\nbuilding a beast in October."},"2580":{"dur":2,"text":"So I just started."},"2582":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, I bring it\nto the beach in spring."},"2586":{"dur":2,"text":"During the summer, I do\nall kind of experiments"},"2588":{"dur":3,"text":"with either the sand or the storms."},"2592":{"dur":4,"text":"And then comes the fall, and\nI declare the animal extinct."},"2598":{"dur":3,"text":"It's dead, and I don't\nwanna work on it anymore."},"2602":{"dur":4,"text":"And since a few years,\nand these animals go to,"},"2606":{"dur":3,"text":"used to go to a boneyard,\nbut since a few years,"},"2610":{"dur":3,"text":"these animals are adopted in exhibitions."},"2615":{"dur":4,"text":"So these exhibitions, they're\nall fossils of animals,"},"2620":{"dur":4,"text":"and you can see the evolutionary\ndevelopment on the

right?"},"2650":{"dur":2,"text":"The Cultural Center in Chicago."},"2652":{"dur":1,"text":"Ever heard of that?"},"2654":{"dur":3,"text":"And then it goes to San

you're,"},"2734":{"dur":4,"text":"in your design, the joint,\nthat first joint that's mobile,"},"2739":{"dur":1,"text":"using the existing materials, was,"},"2740":{"dur":2,"text":"is that like a bottleneck,\noriginally, in doing this?"},"2743":{"dur":1,"text":"- The joints, the bottle?"},"2744":{"dur":1,"text":"- I mean, was there a bottleneck?"},"2746":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, was that one of the\nfirst things you had to overcome"},"2749":{"dur":1,"text":"is figure out how to make the joints work"},"2750":{"dur":1,"text":"with the PVC tubing?"},"2752":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yes, what, I ah,"},"2754":{"dur":3,"text":"so you have different\nsizes of this tubing."},"2757":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Man In Audience] So you have\nright angles and everything?"},"2759":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yeah, you have right\nangles, but I don't use that."},"2762":{"dur":1,"text":"I heat it, and, ah,"},"2766":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't have joints here, right?"},"2768":{"dur":0,"text":"No."},"2769":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I make a sort of heated,\nsort of hook at the end,"},"2774":{"dur":4,"text":"and then I put a ring, also\nmade of this kind of tube,"},"2778":{"dur":4,"text":"and then it just can go over another tube."},"2783":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, in the beginning, always\nthe sand was a big problem,"},"2786":{"dur":3,"text":"because the sand creeps into the joints,"},"2789":{"dur":4,"text":"and so the shape wasn't\na way that it would work,"},"2794":{"dur":1,"text":"the sand, a little bit to\nthe side, in the beginning."},"2796":{"dur":3,"text":"And since a few years, they\nhave a sort of sweat system"},"2799":{"dur":3,"text":"that there are little sweat glands,"},"2803":{"dur":3,"text":"so little holes, in fact, in the tube,"},"2806":{"dur":2,"text":"and before they start walking,"},"2808":{"dur":1,"text":"they first sweat out the sand."},"2810":{"dur":2,"text":"So they wash out the sand of the joints,"},"2812":{"dur":1,"text":"and I put a little bit soap in there,"},"2814":{"dur":3,"text":"just to lubricate it a little bit more."},"2817":{"dur":0,"text":"And in the future, of course,"},"2818":{"dur":1,"text":"when they have to live alone,"},"2820":{"dur":3,"text":"they have to just use\nrainwater to do this."},"2823":{"dur":3,"text":"And so they walk a lot\nbetter with the

sails, a little bit?"},"2835":{"dur":1,"text":"What materials you used?"},"2837":{"dur":3,"text":"And I noticed that, in\nthe picture slideshow,"},"2840":{"dur":2,"text":"at the beginning, there was one that,"},"2842":{"dur":2,"text":"in the video, there was\none that opened itself up"},"2845":{"dur":2,"text":"and closed itself up, the wings."},"2847":{"dur":1,"text":"Can you talk about that a little bit?"},"2848":{"dur":0,"text":"- Yeah, yeah."},"2849":{"dur":1,"text":"So, the sails, in the beginning,"},"2851":{"dur":2,"text":"I made them all of cellotape."},"2853":{"dur":2,"text":"So I just, with cellotape, you can make"},"2855":{"dur":2,"text":"a rope in there, and then,"},"2858":{"dur":2,"text":"but it was a lot of work."},"2862":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, I noticed that\nyou could just use these"},"2866":{"dur":3,"text":"Dacron sails, which are used for kites"},"2869":{"dur":3,"text":"and for sailboats, as well, spinnakers."},"2874":{"dur":2,"text":"And there was somebody\nwho could make it for me"},"2877":{"dur":1,"text":"with tunnels in there."},"2879":{"dur":3,"text":"And the way, they're quite resistant"},"2883":{"dur":4,"text":"for weather circumstances,\nso they, they start white,"},"2888":{"dur":3,"text":"and then in the years, they\nbecome a little bit, ah,"},"2891":{"dur":3,"text":"more natural, I would\nsay; a little bit gray."},"2895":{"dur":4,"text":"They have a sort of, you\ncall it \"reefing\" to sails,"},"2900":{"dur":2,"text":"when it's very stormy on a boat."},"2904":{"dur":2,"text":"That you reef the sails, make it smaller."},"2906":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, there are pumps, which are connected"},"2909":{"dur":3,"text":"with the end of the\nsail, and they pull in."},"2914":{"dur":3,"text":"And as soon as, so, the\nsails are pulled in,"},"2918":{"dur":1,"text":"and then, if you put air in there,"},"2920":{"dur":3,"text":"all the pumps stretch, and then you see"},"2923":{"dur":2,"text":"the sails coming out, and\nthen they catch the wind,"},"2926":{"dur":2,"text":"and then they start waving."},"2928":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's all based, in fact, on pneumatics."},"2932":{"dur":2,"text":"And with this kind of\ntube, you can also make"},"2934":{"dur":2,"text":"very long pumps, of four meters long,"},"2937":{"dur":3,"text":"and it jumps out another four meters."},"2940":{"dur":2,"text":"So you get something that\nstarts with four meters length,"},"2943":{"dur":1,"text":"and then is eight meters."},"2944":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can also make a sort of tongue,"},"2946":{"dur":2,"text":"which

humans?"},"2974":{"dur":3,"text":"Like urban beasts, or cosmopolitan beasts?"},"2978":{"dur":2,"text":"(laughter)"},"2980":{"dur":3,"text":"- Well, of course, if\nI had two more lives,"},"2985":{"dur":3,"text":"I would love to do that,\nto have desert beasts,"},"2989":{"dur":1,"text":"and all those kinds of beasts."},"2991":{"dur":3,"text":"But I only have,\nhopefully, 20 years to go."},"2997":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I restrict myself to\nthe beach, where I was born."},"3001":{"dur":2,"text":"So, apart from life in general,"},"3005":{"dur":3,"text":"it's also about my private life."},"3008":{"dur":2,"text":"That it was the first\nacquaintance with life,"},"3011":{"dur":2,"text":"was on that beach."},"3013":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, that's also the\nbeach where I want to end."},"3017":{"dur":4,"text":"And so the beasts have to\nlive on that particular beach."},"3023":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, you said something."},"3027":{"dur":3,"text":"Ah, that was not your question, was it?"},"3033":{"dur":0,"text":"Or was it?"},"3034":{"dur":2,"text":"No, anyway it comes up later, maybe."},"3036":{"dur":2,"text":"I was thinking of something\nvery interesting, by the way."},"3039":{"dur":2,"text":"(laughter)"},"3043":{"dur":3,"text":"- In the video, you, ah,\nthere was an image of you"},"3047":{"dur":2,"text":"pulling one of them, and it didn't look"},"3049":{"dur":1,"text":"like it was made out of the pipes."},"3050":{"dur":1,"text":"So I was just wondering,\nwhat was the story"},"3052":{"dur":1,"text":"behind that one, because it was massive."},"3053":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, it was much bigger than those ones."},"3054":{"dur":0,"text":"- Oh, yes, that one."},"3055":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes."},"3056":{"dur":3,"text":"So, yes, I usually, I work with the tubes,"},"3060":{"dur":3,"text":"and so I have been quite\nfaithful to the tubes"},"3064":{"dur":3,"text":"for many years, but there was one year,"},"3068":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"3070":{"dur":3,"text":"that I wanted to make a very big animal,"},"3073":{"dur":4,"text":"and it turned out that steel\nis a good material for that."},"3077":{"dur":4,"text":"So this was an animal of\nalmost five meters high."},"3082":{"dur":1,"text":"And you could sit in there."},"3084":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was covered with polyester."},"3086":{"dur":2,"text":"It was, had a polyester skin."},"3088":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was more than three tons."},"3090":{"dur":0,"text":"3.2 tons."},"3092":{"dur":2,"text":"And it walked quite well on the wind."},"3094":{"dur":2,"text":"We tried it on a runway of an airport,"},"3097":{"dur":3,"text":"and in fact, it run too fast on the wind."},"3100":{"dur":1,"text":"It broke itself."},"3102":{"dur":0,"text":"(laughter)"},"3103":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's now in Amsterdam."},"3105":{"dur":2,"text":"It's standing in the street."},"3107":{"dur":3,"text":"And I had this dream that these animals"},"3111":{"dur":2,"text":"would walk on the dam in Amsterdam."},"3115":{"dur":3,"text":"So just like the bulls\nin Pamplona, it would,"},"3118":{"dur":1,"text":"the bulls are out in the streets."},"3120":{"dur":0,"text":"(laughter)"},"3121":{"dur":2,"text":"And the beasts would be out in Amsterdam."},"3123":{"dur":3,"text":"But, until now, I didn't\nsucceed doing that."},"3128":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe later."},"3130":{"dur":0,"text":"Hello."},"3132":{"dur":2,"text":"- Why did you start making Strandbeests?"},"3135":{"dur":0,"text":"- Why?"},"3137":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a very good question."},"3140":{"dur":2,"text":"Because I, I don't know why."},"3143":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"3144":{"dur":1,"text":"I did it."},"3145":{"dur":1,"text":"It's something, well,"},"3149":{"dur":4,"text":"why, it suggests that there's\na reason you do something."},"3154":{"dur":2,"text":"And, in fact, there is no reason."},"3158":{"dur":2,"text":"Life doesn't have a reason."},"3161":{"dur":3,"text":"We are, we have no reason to be here."},"3166":{"dur":3,"text":"But I must admit, it's fun; it's

reason."},"3206":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not good for anything."},"3209":{"dur":3,"text":"It's, apart from just being part of it."},"3213":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's, ah, maybe I, looking backwards,"},"3216":{"dur":3,"text":"I could say that I tried\nto make new forms of life"},"3219":{"dur":4,"text":"to become wiser about the\nexisting forms of life."},"3225":{"dur":3,"text":"And so,

Pretender."},"3237":{"dur":1,"text":"That's me."},"3239":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, I think I became wiser."},"3245":{"dur":2,"text":"So, this was quite a\nnegative answer, right?"},"3247":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"3249":{"dur":2,"text":"But I didn't, to make it more positive,"},"3251":{"dur":1,"text":"I became wiser, yeah."},"3252":{"dur":2,"text":"(laughter)"},"3256":{"dur":2,"text":"- You were talking about\nhow some of the beasts"},"3259":{"dur":4,"text":"know how to sense the weather,\nfrom when it's gonna storm"},"3263":{"dur":1,"text":"to, you know, post themselves down."},"3265":{"dur":2,"text":"I was just wondering if there's\na mechanism like the cells"},"3268":{"dur":2,"text":"that help you realize that\nthe weather's coming, or?"},"3271":{"dur":3,"text":"- Well, I was thinking of a barometer."},"3274":{"dur":4,"text":"Because you can make a\nbarometer with these bottles."},"3279":{"dur":2,"text":"So they can measure the\npressure with a line,"},"3282":{"dur":1,"text":"with water in there."},"3283":{"dur":2,"text":"So if the pressure would be low,"},"3285":{"dur":3,"text":"then the water would raise in the tube,"},"3289":{"dur":1,"text":"and then, with a water-feeler,"},"3291":{"dur":1,"text":"you could feel the water, which is rising."},"3292":{"dur":3,"text":"So they could warn, for\nat the low pressure,"},"3296":{"dur":4,"text":"and warn for a storm, so they\ncan take their precautions."},"3305":{"dur":2,"text":"- This is wonderful."},"3308":{"dur":3,"text":"Because you walk your beasts by the ocean,"},"3313":{"dur":3,"text":"and the ocean can blow lots of driftwood"},"3316":{"dur":3,"text":"and things up onto the\nbeach, you have two choices:"},"3319":{"dur":2,"text":"you either clean the beach\nor you make your beast"},"3322":{"dur":2,"text":"smarter so it can step over things."},"3324":{"dur":2,"text":"So are you thinking of\ntrying to get things"},"3327":{"dur":1,"text":"to step over, so you'd have to"},"3329":{"dur":1,"text":"come up with different mechanisms?"},"3330":{"dur":0,"text":"- Yes."},"3331":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, of course you have,\napart from driftwood,"},"3334":{"dur":4,"text":"you have other objects, like holes in the,"},"3338":{"dur":3,"text":"and little lakes, and sometimes\nthey have this struggle,"},"3341":{"dur":4,"text":"to walk over that, but that's\nwhy they have the ski poles."},"3347":{"dur":2,"text":"So they have pumps, which are on the hip,"},"3349":{"dur":2,"text":"front hip, and they all stretch together."},"3352":{"dur":2,"text":"There are seven of those."},"3354":{"dur":3,"text":"And they just can jump over, more or less."},"3358":{"dur":2,"text":"Also, they can walk on\nthe very fluffy sand,"},"3361":{"dur":4,"text":"and so they have the ski\npoles to overcome that."},"3365":{"dur":2,"text":"Of course, it would be nicer"},"3368":{"dur":1,"text":"if they would clean the beach, right?"},"3370":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"3372":{"dur":0,"text":"But, I, ah,"},"3374":{"dur":1,"text":"well, I will be working on that."},"3376":{"dur":2,"text":"(laughter)"},"3379":{"dur":2,"text":"- I know you said you started painting,"},"3381":{"dur":3,"text":"and once you got a taste for\nthis, you moved on, of

painting."},"3393":{"dur":2,"text":"And indeed, if I had, you know,"},"3397":{"dur":2,"text":"indeed, more lives, I would be a painter."},"3400":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I would like to be a poet, as well."},"3404":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are so many things we wanna do."},"3406":{"dur":2,"text":"But you have to make your choices."},"3409":{"dur":3,"text":"And I love painting,\nstill, but I have no time."},"3414":{"dur":3,"text":"- Do you think you'll\never try a swimming beast?"},"3418":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yes, that's a good idea."},"3420":{"dur":3,"text":"Because, there were swimming beasts."},"3424":{"dur":2,"text":"It was, sort of, the worm family."},"3426":{"dur":3,"text":"I didn't show it yet,\nbut they had bottles."},"3431":{"dur":4,"text":"Under each side was a worm,\nwhich could move like a worm."},"3435":{"dur":2,"text":"And it could persist in its movement"},"3437":{"dur":2,"text":"and sort of swim, there,"},"3439":{"dur":3,"text":"but they didn't walk very well on sand."},"3444":{"dur":3,"text":"So you have either animals\nwhich are afraid of water,"},"3448":{"dur":2,"text":"or animals who love the water."},"3451":{"dur":2,"text":"And these were water-loving animals,"},"3454":{"dur":2,"text":"but they hated the sand."},"3456":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I have that part"},"3459":{"dur":2,"text":"of evolution branch, it just stopped."},"3461":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe it's come up again."},"3464":{"dur":3,"text":"In the, also in the museum, in Salem,"},"3467":{"dur":3,"text":"you can see the family\ntree of the

relationship\nto these beasts?"},"3483":{"dur":2,"text":"Are they, like, friends, or children,"},"3485":{"dur":3,"text":"or something else, entirely?"},"3488":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well, you would think that, of course,"},"3490":{"dur":4,"text":"that after you're working\nwith this lovely material"},"3495":{"dur":4,"text":"and these lovely beasts, that\nyou get a sort of

mechanism,"},"3510":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's a totally\ndifferent kind of feeling"},"3513":{"dur":3,"text":"which I have with my girl specimen,"},"3516":{"dur":2,"text":"with my family, and it's much,"},"3520":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't recognize a\nperson in this mechanism."},"3526":{"dur":2,"text":"Of course I love those beasts,"},"3528":{"dur":2,"text":"and I see them as my mental

above."},"3537":{"dur":2,"text":"(laughter)"},"3540":{"dur":4,"text":"And there comes a day that\nyou put your physical children"},"3544":{"dur":1,"text":"on the streets, and you say:"},"3545":{"dur":1,"text":"you have to do it on your own."},"3547":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's what's gonna happen"},"3548":{"dur":2,"text":"with the mental children, as

a lot of disappointments."},"3577":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to encounter with."},"3582":{"dur":3,"text":"But it seems, if you have\nso many disappointments,"},"3586":{"dur":3,"text":"that you don't care, after a while,"},"3589":{"dur":3,"text":"that it doesn't, it doesn't work."},"3593":{"dur":3,"text":"And in fact, I was, a few months ago,"},"3598":{"dur":2,"text":"I was in Nagasaki, where\nI

length, you could say."},"3720":{"dur":2,"text":"But in fact, this is a new wheel."},"3724":{"dur":4,"text":"Because a wheel stays on\nthe same level, as well,"},"3729":{"dur":4,"text":"and so this has the\nsame quality as a wheel."},"3733":{"dur":2,"text":"The only thing is, you\nhave legs, which leap over."},"3736":{"dur":1,"text":"If you have a wheel on the beach,"},"3738":{"dur":3,"text":"it has to touch every point of the path."},"3742":{"dur":4,"text":"So it has to deform the sand\non all the points of the path,"},"3747":{"dur":3,"text":"and legs, they just jump over."},"3750":{"dur":1,"text":"And they leap over pieces of the path,"},"3752":{"dur":4,"text":"so that has less resistance\nthan a wheel on soft sands."},"3759":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's why the

that,"},"3769":{"dur":4,"text":"and of course, a wheel is a\nwonderful invention of us."},"3773":{"dur":4,"text":"And it works, still, quite\nwell, after 5,000 years."},"3777":{"dur":3,"text":"But after 5,000 years,\nalso, we have a new wheel."},"3781":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's their leg system."},"3784":{"dur":1,"text":"Still more questions, eh?"},"3786":{"dur":1,"text":"Ah, it's so funny."},"3788":{"dur":2,"text":"- Scheveningen is one\nof my favorite beaches."},"3791":{"dur":1,"text":"- Oh, really?"},"3792":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, and I loved this presentation,"},"3794":{"dur":2,"text":"but I'm very curious how\nlong some of these live,"},"3797":{"dur":1,"text":"alone on the beach?"},"3799":{"dur":2,"text":"And how, has any one of\nthem ever wandered off"},"3802":{"dur":2,"text":"and sort of had a mind of its own?"},"3806":{"dur":0,"text":"- Well, ah,"},"3808":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm talking about these\nbeasts as if they're almost"},"3813":{"dur":4,"text":"ready to go, but they cannot\ndo without me for five minutes."},"3817":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"3818":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I have to nurse them\nall the time, still."},"3822":{"dur":3,"text":"But I hope to stretch\nthe period that they,"},"3828":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're getting better and better."},"3830":{"dur":4,"text":"Because in the beginning they\ncouldn't do without me at all."},"3834":{"dur":3,"text":"And what was your second question?"},"3838":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Woman In Audience]\nHas anyone wandered off?"},"3839":{"dur":1,"text":"- Oh yeah!"},"3840":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, I had, sometimes,\nthat's what you have,"},"3843":{"dur":1,"text":"sometimes, on Dutch beaches,"},"3845":{"dur":3,"text":"you have a, totally wind silence,"},"3848":{"dur":3,"text":"and then there comes a five-minute storm."},"3851":{"dur":2,"text":"So I had a herd on the beach,"},"3854":{"dur":2,"text":"and then the five-minute storm,"},"3856":{"dur":3,"text":"the whole herd was rolling on the beach."},"3860":{"dur":4,"text":"Just a mile down there, and\nthen I had to pick them all up."},"3866":{"dur":3,"text":"But of course, it's PVC,\nI should be careful."},"3869":{"dur":1,"text":"It's pollution."},"3870":{"dur":2,"text":"So, when they're in the sea,\nI have to run into the sea"},"3873":{"dur":4,"text":"to get them out, and so I have\nto save them always, yeah."},"3878":{"dur":3,"text":"But, mark my words, there comes a day,"},"3882":{"dur":4,"text":"before I die, that these\nanimals are going to live."},"3887":{"dur":3,"text":"We have a few more questions, yes?"},"3890":{"dur":1,"text":"- You talked about, like, the lifecycle,"},"3892":{"dur":2,"text":"where you, you know, build\nthem over the winter,"},"3894":{"dur":2,"text":"and then they walk in\nthe spring and summer,"},"3896":{"dur":1,"text":"and they're off to the boneyard."},"3898":{"dur":2,"text":"Has the whole 25 years been just, kind of,"},"3901":{"dur":2,"text":"linear and incremental, or\nhas there been occasional,"},"3903":{"dur":1,"text":"like, flash, and then you made,"},"3905":{"dur":2,"text":"like, a great leap\nforward in improvements?"},"3907":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yes, it's not going,\nit's not easy going, no."},"3912":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it's going in really big jumps,"},"3916":{"dur":2,"text":"and for a long time, nothing happens."},"3919":{"dur":3,"text":"Sometimes I use old animals,\nto take all the legs off,"},"3922":{"dur":3,"text":"and use it for a new animal,\nso it's not very consequence,"},"3925":{"dur":3,"text":"this cycle of every\nyear, because otherwise,"},"3929":{"dur":2,"text":"I couldn't work on the 38th animal,"},"3932":{"dur":2,"text":"because then it would have been 38 years."},"3935":{"dur":1,"text":"So sometimes I do a little bit more,"},"3937":{"dur":2,"text":"smaller animals, bigger animals."},"3939":{"dur":3,"text":"But the last few years,\nit's about every year."},"3944":{"dur":1,"text":"One animal."},"3945":{"dur":1,"text":"- We'll make these the last two."},"3947":{"dur":0,"text":"- The last two, yeah."},"3948":{"dur":2,"text":"- I find it very interesting\nhow you talk about these"},"3951":{"dur":2,"text":"as animals, and you\nrefer to them continually"},"3953":{"dur":2,"text":"as if they're alive, and\nI wonder if you could"},"3955":{"dur":2,"text":"just explain a little bit\nmore about your philosophy"},"3958":{"dur":2,"text":"on the definition of \"life\",\nand this kind of evolution"},"3960":{"dur":4,"text":"towards zeros and ones and\nreproduction through us,"},"3964":{"dur":1,"text":"that you've been talking about."},"3966":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yes, well, of course, these,"},"3970":{"dur":2,"text":"what helps very much in the reproduction"},"3972":{"dur":3,"text":"of the Strandbeests was\nthe coming of the internet."},"3976":{"dur":3,"text":"Especially the coming of YouTube."},"3979":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's, because you\ndon't need very much time"},"3983":{"dur":3,"text":"to see what's happening, when\nyou see an animal walking"},"3987":{"dur":3,"text":"on YouTube, and we seem\nto be very sensitive"},"3991":{"dur":2,"text":"for this movement of animals."},"3995":{"dur":3,"text":"Because in evolution, an\nanimal could mean something"},"3999":{"dur":3,"text":"to run away for, or something to eat,"},"4002":{"dur":4,"text":"so our retina is very sensitive\nfor that kind of movement."},"4006":{"dur":4,"text":"And when you see it on YouTube,\nyou see an animal walking,"},"4011":{"dur":3,"text":"but you also see just a bunch of tubes."},"4014":{"dur":3,"text":"And that somehow turns\na switch in our brain."},"4018":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's happening to almost everybody."},"4021":{"dur":3,"text":"When they see 10 seconds\nof Strandbeest walking,"},"4025":{"dur":2,"text":"they have this switch turning over."},"4031":{"dur":3,"text":"That's why the meme of Strandbeests,"},"4035":{"dur":1,"text":"I hope you know, ah,"},"4037":{"dur":3,"text":"the term \"meme\" means\nsomething like a gene,"},"4040":{"dur":4,"text":"but something, a gene\nwhich jumps from one brain"},"4044":{"dur":4,"text":"to another brain, so it's\nmultiplying through brains."},"4049":{"dur":3,"text":"And this meme of the\nStrandbeest, they are multiplying"},"4052":{"dur":3,"text":"so well, because of the\ninternet and so they,"},"4057":{"dur":2,"text":"the meme goes from brain to brain,"},"4060":{"dur":3,"text":"and so you tell it to your neighbor,"},"4063":{"dur":1,"text":"and they look at the internet,"},"4064":{"dur":3,"text":"and so that's how the\nStrandbeest, hopefully,"},"4068":{"dur":3,"text":"they will stay for a while\nin the brains of you."},"4071":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe there comes a moment\nthat we all have forgotten"},"4073":{"dur":3,"text":"about the Strandbeest,\nbut my hope is, in fact,"},"4077":{"dur":4,"text":"that when these animals\nare walking on the beach,"},"4082":{"dur":4,"text":"and I leave the planet, that\nsome students take over."},"4087":{"dur":2,"text":"And they continue my work."},"4090":{"dur":2,"text":"So there are a lot of students here,"},"4092":{"dur":3,"text":"and I hope that this is going to,"},"4095":{"dur":2,"text":"this meme is really getting\nroots in their brain."},"4098":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes?"},"4099":{"dur":2,"text":"- I notice that some of your constructions"},"4102":{"dur":2,"text":"are very large and very complex."},"4104":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you work alone, or do you have a team"},"4107":{"dur":4,"text":"that helps you with the\nconstruction, or even the design?"},"4112":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well, I usually work alone."},"4116":{"dur":4,"text":"But, sometimes I need help\nof people on the beach."},"4122":{"dur":3,"text":"Because these very big animals, they,"},"4126":{"dur":2,"text":"I cannot handle on my own, anymore."},"4129":{"dur":1,"text":"So I need people."},"4130":{"dur":2,"text":"Nowadays, I build something behind my car"},"4132":{"dur":3,"text":"so I can bring it back, when\nit has been walking away."},"4136":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's a person\nwho is, when I'm working"},"4140":{"dur":2,"text":"on the beach, there's a person\nin my winter working place,"},"4143":{"dur":1,"text":"and he makes parts."},"4145":{"dur":4,"text":"So I have help, of people who\nproduce just the regular parts"},"4151":{"dur":2,"text":"which come back all the time."},"4153":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, making the walking units,"},"4155":{"dur":3,"text":"which don't change that much, anymore."},"4158":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, there are some parts\nare the end of evolution."},"4163":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they reproduce those parts."},"4167":{"dur":2,"text":"Somebody sitting there, still, or?"},"4170":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience muttering)"},"4171":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"4172":{"dur":1,"text":"So we are at the
