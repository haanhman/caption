here."},"3559":{"dur":6,"text":"And then I\u2019m going to continue to rotate\nhere and now this is the conundrum I mentioned."},"3565":{"dur":8,"text":"So now we\u2019re at the 5 carbon and so the\n5 carbon we have here the hydrogen off in"},"3573":{"dur":6,"text":"the cyclic form, the CH2 off on the left,\nand the oxygen that\u2019s off, and you just"},"3580":{"dur":6,"text":"have to imagine
