and"},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"they wanna eat it too, then they wanna\nmaintain some notion of privacy."},"242":{"dur":5,"text":"So, it seems like certainly on the margins\nthere's things that we could do to"},"247":{"dur":3,"text":"more ethical and encourage companies to be\nmore ethical, but on the whole it seems"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"like society needs to make a choice, and\nthat choice has perhaps already been made."},"255":{"dur":4,"text":"We can allow corporations to intrude in\nour daily lives in ways that make things"},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"really nice and we can you know

and"},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"intrude in your daily life,\nwe're all participating in that."},"292":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I think that's completely ethical,"},"294":{"dur":4,"text":"I think, in that way, privacy is dead\nthere's, there's no more such thing."},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"The alternative to that,\nto saying that privacy is dead,"},"302":{"dur":4,"text":"is that we've become much more reserved\nin allowing corporations into our,"},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"our public lives,\nI mean into our private lives, excuse me."},"310":{"dur":4,"text":"And like maybe have some reluctance\nabout what the private world intrusion"},"315":{"dur":0,"text":"looks like."},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"That's a much broader sense of changes\nthat I don't think people are ready for"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"given the, the Sprint level intrusion."},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think given that we all like\nthe goodies that come from it,"},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"it's very ethical."},"329":{"dur":5,"text":">> Yeah, I, I,\nI agree with what Justin said."},"334":{"dur":4,"text":"I, I think while it's important first of\nall to understand that we are in the

weren't really, so"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"there's not really anything\ngoing on seriously."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"That really shook up everybody."},"410":{"dur":4,"text":"So, so, yes, it seems the battle is,\non the, on the one hand, is decided,"},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"and the thing of privacy is obviously a\nlittle bit lost because the private always"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"has to go with the public and what is\npublic, what is private is surely blurred."},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"Back in the days, you went to a public\nspace, you went to the park and"},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"you were, I

nobody can, however, now,"},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"there is no such thing,\nyou're always in public, right?"},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"So, and therefore, private doesn't exist\nanymore because its digital footprint."},"443":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, the most revolutionary suggestions\nin this idea of creating kind of like,"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"a new institutional structure to that,"},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"would be to really redefine intellectual\nproperty, and some people argue for that."},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"And say, well, your data is your

property."},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"That every footprint that I\nleave behind is my property."},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I can sell it to you, and\nsome people suggest to create markets,

to companies."},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"So, that would be A more revolutionary\nstep to take and, and, yeah,"},"481":{"dur":4,"text":"in line with, with, with modern\ninstitutions, markets and so forth."},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"And the response from Silicon Valley is\nbasically, yes, we're already doing that,"},"490":{"dur":4,"text":"because I allow you to use\nmy social media services for"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"free, and you pay me with your data."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"So they said we already have that\nin place, kind of, like, right?"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't have in place for\neverything, but intuitively,"},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"in some aspects we already have, so\nthere's a line every time they're like,"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"walking, pushing back,\nand, and

pretty much won."},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I don't really, also, I came to\nthe conclusion after, you know, so"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"many years hearing and\nthinking about that, that, yes,"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"there's actually nothing\nreally worrisome about it."},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"If it, if it's in the realm, for example,\nof business, of ec, ec, economics, and so"},"526":{"dur":4,"text":"forth, and even with some other things,\nwe have to worry about education,"},"530":{"dur":4,"text":"health, some of them are more more,\nless comfortable with,

democracy."},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"Cuz democracy's the only, it's not, it's\nnice if they know what I want to shop for,"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"if Amazon makes suggestive."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"But democracy is really,\nif you think, the way it's set up,"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"it's completely wrong functioning,\nwithout any

well,"},"563":{"dur":4,"text":"it's populism, you know, if you talk\nwhat people want to hear, and so forth."},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm, the only way, and\nmaybe Justin can talk more about that,"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"but I think that the end of privacy's very\nthing is that the way we execute democracy"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"is not prepared for that."},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"For business, and whatever, that's fi,\nAmazon, that's just how it is, I think."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":">> To not just to be,\nlike, a quick wet blanket."},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't,\nI don't know that it's that resolved."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think you see it when you,\nI mean, you start talk about democracy."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"I think you see it,\nI think you see it, sort of,"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"in people's reactions to\ndifferent kinds of institutions."},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"So, just an example Canada\nostensibly has no useless sens,"},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"no

around"},"605":{"dur":4,"text":"removing it was around, we've gotten so\nmany complaints about privacy in terms of"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"the census, and why should the government\nknow how many

would be whether"},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"you should receive medical treatment,\nor not, for particular condition."},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think that's going\nto be the real
