As you can see here,"},"64":{"dur":4,"text":"one of the themes is that what happens in\nthe Arctic doesn\u2019t stay in the Arctic, and"},"68":{"dur":7,"text":"I\u2019ll address that theme throughout the rest\nof this short presentation."},"75":{"dur":4,"text":"So first, I want to spend a little bit of\ntime showing you what the Arctic looks like"},"80":{"dur":5,"text":"from space in various ways.

So you don\u2019t"},"95":{"dur":4,"text":"see clouds here, which of course you would\nsee from space. But what I like about this"},"100":{"dur":5,"text":"illustration is that it makes the point very\nclearly that the Arctic is an ocean surrounded"},"105":{"dur":6,"text":"by land, which is very much in contrast to\nthe Antarctic at the opposite end of the earth,"},"111":{"dur":7,"text":"so to speak, which is a continent, which is\nland surrounded by ocean. That has significant"},"118":{"dur":7,"text":"implications for the reaction of the two polar\nregions to changes in global climate. So here,"},"125":{"dur":3,"text":"we\u2019re only talking about the Arctic."},"129":{"dur":6,"text":"This is perhaps more a better view of what\nthe Arctic would look like from space, without"},"135":{"dur":5,"text":"all the labels, of course. But here we see\nclouds and sea ice and the Greenland ice sheet"},"140":{"dur":5,"text":"down there in the lower left.

Here, you can see sea ice at\na pretty high resolution, about 250 meters."},"163":{"dur":4,"text":"We have higher resolution instruments than\nthat. But here we see ice flows.

Sometimes, we see infrared"},"219":{"dur":5,"text":"data as well. The problem is in the polar\nregions, with all the snow and ice, it\u2019s"},"224":{"dur":5,"text":"difficult to determine the properties of those\nphysical parts of the system and distinguish"},"230":{"dur":4,"text":"them from clouds, for example, in just the\nvisible part of the spectrum."},"234":{"dur":6,"text":"So we need to look at the Arctic and the Antarctic\nwith what I\u2019m calling here alien vision,"},"240":{"dur":5,"text":"meaning something beyond the visible portion\nof the spectrum \u2013 near-infrared, infrared,"},"246":{"dur":6,"text":"microwave.

Many different"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"things that I don\u2019t have time to show."},"362":{"dur":4,"text":"So the second point I want to make is that\nwe estimate many properties of the physical"},"366":{"dur":6,"text":"climate system from space, and all of these\nhave operational applications. We use sea"},"373":{"dur":6,"text":"ice for shipping and for our oil and gas exploration.\nWe use information about the atmosphere as"},"379":{"dur":6,"text":"well as snow cover in numerical weather prediction\nall over the world. But all these properties"},"386":{"dur":6,"text":"also have climatological implications as well,\nand we use them in climate studies. Probably"},"392":{"dur":5,"text":"the most popular trend in the Arctic that\npeople have seen over the years is how sea"},"397":{"dur":5,"text":"ice cover has changed. We all know that it\u2019s\nbeen decreasing. That\u2019s not new news. That\u2019s,"},"403":{"dur":5,"text":"in some sense, old news. What\u2019s perhaps\nnewest about it is that we\u2019ve had record"},"408":{"dur":7,"text":"minima in the ice cover in 2007 and again\nin 2012, and then a fairly significant rebound"},"416":{"dur":5,"text":"in 2013 and 2014. But the trend is still downward."},"421":{"dur":5,"text":"What\u2019s newer and what I\u2019m not showing\nhere is that we have new products from space"},"426":{"dur":5,"text":"that estimate sea ice thickness, and we\u2019ve\napplied one of our own products to 30 years"},"431":{"dur":5,"text":"of data; and we now know that not only has\nthe Arctic ice pack been thinning, but we"},"437":{"dur":7,"text":"know exactly where and in what \u2013 to what\nmagnitude and what degree over the last 30-plus"},"444":{"dur":5,"text":"years. So that\u2019s new information we\u2019re\nvery excited about, and we\u2019ll continue to"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"monitor that into the future."},"452":{"dur":5,"text":"From space we also observe how the atmosphere\nis changing \u2013 winds, chemistry, temperature,"},"457":{"dur":6,"text":"humidity. Here\u2019s an example of how winds\nhave changed. We know that the polar jet stream"},"463":{"dur":5,"text":"has shifted. It\u2019s strengthened somewhat\nover Eurasia but weakened over Canada. What\u2019s"},"469":{"dur":6,"text":"important about that is that this affects\nmid-latitude climate. As the jet stream weakens,"},"475":{"dur":5,"text":"it tends to meander more, and we get more\nextreme weather in the mid latitudes. So here\u2019s"},"481":{"dur":7,"text":"another example of what happens in the Arctic\nisn\u2019t staying in the Arctic."},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"Vegetation has changed. Plant growth has increased\nup to 10 percent in some areas. It\u2019s not"},"493":{"dur":6,"text":"just getting greener; it\u2019s changing in character.\nSo if we replace tundra vegetation with shrubs,"},"500":{"dur":5,"text":"for example, that changes how much sunlight\nis reflected, and there can be a feedback"},"505":{"dur":5,"text":"effect where actually a change in vegetation\ncan lead to even greater warming, which leads"},"510":{"dur":4,"text":"to a greater change in vegetation and so forth."},"515":{"dur":5,"text":"The last point I want to make is not about\nchanges in individual properties of the climate"},"521":{"dur":5,"text":"system, but from space, by combining many\ndifferent types of satellites, we can also"},"527":{"dur":5,"text":"look at how these \u2013 the different components\nof the climate system interact. And what we\u2019ve"},"532":{"dur":4,"text":"learned very recently, and haven\u2019t even\npublished this yet, is that changes in wintertime"},"537":{"dur":5,"text":"cloud cover can affect summertime sea ice.\nAnd that\u2019s hard to grasp because we\u2019re"},"542":{"dur":5,"text":"talking about a difference in time of seven\nto nine months.

Very difficult,\nbut we found a very strong relationship about"},"558":{"dur":7,"text":"the \u2013 how clouds in the winter affect summertime\nsea ice. This will help us improve short-term"},"566":{"dur":5,"text":"sea ice forecasts. So the fourth point I want\nto make is that satellites can be used not"},"571":{"dur":4,"text":"just to study individual properties of the\nclimate system, but also the feedbacks and"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"interactions between them."},"578":{"dur":4,"text":"So what does all this matter? Well, changes\nin sea ice impact shipping, fisheries \u2013 as"},"583":{"dur":7,"text":"we\u2019ll hear from Ed Farley in the next presentation\n\u2013 coastal erosion, wildlife, and weather,"},"590":{"dur":5,"text":"as I\u2019ve just pointed out. Changes in snow\ncover impact water supply, which is very important"},"596":{"dur":7,"text":"to many especially arid countries. Also weather,\nagriculture; a warming Arctic means a thawing"},"604":{"dur":6,"text":"permafrost, which impacts infrastructure.\nAnd of course, the big one is that melting"},"611":{"dur":5,"text":"ice sheets cause an increase in sea level\nor a sea level rise, and that\u2019ll impact"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"any coastal city anywhere in the world."},"619":{"dur":4,"text":"So again, Arctic processes affect global climate.\nWhat happens in the Arctic doesn\u2019t stay"},"624":{"dur":6,"text":"in the Arctic. Satellites have been critical\n\u2013 essential \u2013 to discovering, monitoring,"},"631":{"dur":6,"text":"and quantifying changes in sea ice thickness\n\u2013 that\u2019s new \u2013 plant growth, changes"},"638":{"dur":6,"text":"in circulation, melting of ice sheets. And\nwe\u2019re also using satellites to look at relationships"},"645":{"dur":6,"text":"between parts of the climate system \u2013 (cell\nphone beeps) \u2013 sorry, that was mine. (Laughter.)"},"651":{"dur":7,"text":"And a new discovery, I think, is that the\nclouds have actually been reducing the magnitude"},"658":{"dur":4,"text":"\u2013 or reducing, holding in check the magnitude\nof Arctic warming. The way clouds have been"},"663":{"dur":7,"text":"changing over time has actually acted to reduce\nthe amount of warming that\u2019s occurring in"},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"the Arctic, and that\u2019s a very important\npoint from a climatological perspective."},"674":{"dur":7,"text":"Once again, we need lots of different satellite\nsensors. No single U.S. agency or agency in"},"681":{"dur":6,"text":"any other country has all the sensors we need.\nWe need to continue to promote, facilitate"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"international partnerships."},"689":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, having said all that about satellites\nand how great they are for observing the Arctic,"},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"we can\u2019t see everything from space. And\nin fact, we\u2019ll hear about one aspect of"},"699":{"dur":6,"text":"the Arctic climate change that we can\u2019t\nhear in a minute from Ed on fisheries. Thank"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"you."},"707":{"dur":7,"text":"MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Our next presenter\nthis morning is Dr. Edward Farley. Ed is the"},"718":{"dur":5,"text":"ecosystem monitoring and assessment program\nmanager at the Auke Bay Laboratories, which"},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"is part of the NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science\nCenter."},"726":{"dur":0,"text":"Ed."},"727":{"dur":7,"text":"DR FARLEY: All right. Thanks, Mike. Good morning,\neveryone. I\u2019m going to jump right into it."},"734":{"dur":6,"text":"The focus of this talk is going to be sea\nice impact on fat that\u2019s available to fish."},"740":{"dur":6,"text":"So one of the main fish food that we see in\nthis region is zooplankton, and we\u2019re going"},"746":{"dur":5,"text":"to focus on some of what changes occur between\nlarge zooplankton, which you see here, which"},"752":{"dur":6,"text":"is a beneficial fish food for fish, and some\nof the small zooplankton, which I\u2019ll show"},"758":{"dur":4,"text":"in just a minute."},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"So the focus of the talk here is going to\nbe in the Arctic, which is up in the north"},"767":{"dur":5,"text":"in the Chukchi Sea. And again, Jeff just highlighted\nthat decline in sea ice extent in September."},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019ll go into that in a few more minutes\nin a little more detail. And I\u2019m going to"},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"start with the subarctic, which is in the\nsoutheastern Bering Sea. It\u2019s that continental"},"780":{"dur":7,"text":"shelf down in the bottom part of the picture\nthere. And the issue here is sea ice extent"},"788":{"dur":6,"text":"and duration during spring and how that might\nimpact the availability of large versus small"},"794":{"dur":4,"text":"zooplankton for fish. And one of the things\nI want to mention, that if you\u2019re a fish"},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"or a marine mammal in this region, you\u2019re\ngoing to want to store as much fat as possible"},"803":{"dur":4,"text":"before winter so you have a better chance\nto survive during winter. So that\u2019s why"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"fat is really important."},"809":{"dur":7,"text":"So I\u2019m going to begin here. Our research\nhas indicated that when we have early ice"},"817":{"dur":7,"text":"retreat, we get a plant bloom that\u2019s feeding\nthe zooplankton, mostly small zooplankton,"},"824":{"dur":5,"text":"and that these small zooplankton have less\nfat. So early ice retreat is typically related"},"830":{"dur":6,"text":"to warming temperatures. And when we have\na late ice retreat, usually related to colder"},"836":{"dur":6,"text":"winters and colder springs, we get an earlier\nplant bloom that feeds a different component"},"843":{"dur":5,"text":"of our zooplankton. It\u2019s the large zooplankton,\nand we\u2019ve now found out that those zooplankton"},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"have more fat."},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"So if we look into an example, which I\u2019ll\npull into fisheries here in just a moment,"},"857":{"dur":5,"text":"we have a period of time \u2013 most recently\n2002 through 2005 \u2013 where there was an early"},"862":{"dur":7,"text":"ice retreat. And that area that you see down\nin the subarctic, which is right down in this"},"870":{"dur":5,"text":"region right here \u2013 you see from satellite\nimage there\u2019s very little ice down there."},"875":{"dur":6,"text":"That\u2019s in May 2002 compared with May 2012,\nwhich was similar to a period of late ice"},"881":{"dur":6,"text":"retreat from 2007 through 2012. And here you\ncan see that in that time period, there\u2019s"},"887":{"dur":5,"text":"ice extending all the way down into that subarctic\nzone."},"893":{"dur":6,"text":"So one of the major fisheries in the subarctic\nis our walleye pollock fishery. Walleye pollock"},"899":{"dur":7,"text":"have a commercial value of around half a billion\ndollars annually from 2012 McDowell Group."},"907":{"dur":7,"text":"They\u2019re also utilized for fake crab \u2013 many\nof you may have had that \u2013 and premium fish"},"914":{"dur":5,"text":"sticks, such as the example I show here. And\nin that time period that I am showing here"},"920":{"dur":7,"text":"from 1994 through 2014, we see that there\nwas a downward trend in the biomass or thousands"},"928":{"dur":7,"text":"of tons of pollock that were available in\nthe Bering Sea. That was followed again by"},"936":{"dur":5,"text":"an increase, but if we focus on this downward\ntrend, that tended to occur during that early"},"941":{"dur":5,"text":"ice retreat period. That drop amounted to\na 40 percent drop in available pollock catch,"},"947":{"dur":6,"text":"so that was a big issue. No one really understood\nwhy the pollock biomass was declining, but"},"954":{"dur":6,"text":"it was impacting the fishery. It was followed\nthen by a recovery, fortunately, and that"},"961":{"dur":4,"text":"occurred during what we saw as this late ice\nretreat period."},"965":{"dur":7,"text":"So, as I mentioned before, when we get early\nice retreat, we get these smaller zooplankton"},"972":{"dur":6,"text":"with less fat. When we get the late ice retreat,\nwe get larger zooplankton with more fat, and"},"978":{"dur":5,"text":"this is just an example of some of the zooplankton\ntypes. The top four are small zooplankton;"},"983":{"dur":4,"text":"the bottom two are large zooplankton, and\nyou can see just in the figures here there\u2019s"},"988":{"dur":5,"text":"about two times more fat in the large zooplankton\nthan in the small zooplankton. Not only that;"},"994":{"dur":5,"text":"we see there is even a difference in the amount\nof fat with all the zooplankton types between"},"1000":{"dur":4,"text":"the late ice retreat and early ice retreat.\nBut the take-home message here is if you\u2019re"},"1004":{"dur":4,"text":"a fish, you want to eat the large zooplankton,\nyou get a better food packet."},"1008":{"dur":4,"text":"And if we look at what our fish were eating\n\u2013 these are the young fish that we\u2019re"},"1013":{"dur":4,"text":"studying \u2013 we can see that overall in the\nearly ice retreat period they were feeding"},"1017":{"dur":4,"text":"more on small zooplankton because they were\nmore populous in the environment that they"},"1022":{"dur":4,"text":"were swimming in. Then we move into the late\nice retreat; they were feeding more on large"},"1027":{"dur":6,"text":"zooplankton because those large zooplankton\nwere more abundant in that period. And if"},"1033":{"dur":6,"text":"we \u2013 we all know that you are what you eat,\nand if you look at the condition of these"},"1040":{"dur":6,"text":"young pollock in that early ice retreat period,\nthey \u2013 this is a measure of fat \u2013 their"},"1046":{"dur":7,"text":"fat content was much less than it was in that\nlate ice retreat period. So again, they were"},"1053":{"dur":7,"text":"feeding on, in this late ice retreat period,\nbetter food, giving them more fat, more storage"},"1061":{"dur":2,"text":"for winter survival."},"1064":{"dur":4,"text":"And just to show you, we\u2019ve related that\namount of fat to the survival of these pollock,"},"1068":{"dur":4,"text":"and we can see there\u2019s a nice linear relationship\nthere just indicating the more fat that they"},"1072":{"dur":4,"text":"have prior to winter, the better they\u2019re\ngoing to survive. So the mechanism then is"},"1077":{"dur":7,"text":"really how ice is impacting the type of fish\nfood, either low-fat fish food or high-fat"},"1085":{"dur":7,"text":"fish food, and how that fat reserve impacts\nwinter survival, and that drives mortality"},"1092":{"dur":5,"text":"in this \u2013 in that low-fat reserve period,\nearly ice retreat period versus a high-fat"},"1098":{"dur":4,"text":"reserve period, which is the late ice retreat."},"1102":{"dur":4,"text":"So if we move up into the Chukchi Sea now\ninto the Arctic, the issue there is declining"},"1107":{"dur":5,"text":"sea ice extent, as Jeff had mentioned. And\nthis is during September, so if you remove"},"1112":{"dur":5,"text":"the ice, ice is a reflective surface and the\nsunlight then hits that reflective surface;"},"1117":{"dur":4,"text":"most of that energy is bounced back up into\nthe atmosphere.
