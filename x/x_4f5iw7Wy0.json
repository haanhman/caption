to\nremove the excess."},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"And so early modern\nmedicine and before"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"tends to focus a lot on purging\nand lots of emetics next"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"to

fine."},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"The major caveat\nis I'm not going"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"to be talking about\nchocolate, so anyone who"},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"was here hoping for a\nnice history of

today."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a mix of cocoa, milk,\nspices, often chili and pepper"},"641":{"dur":0,"text":"and cinnamon."},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"And the reason I'm not\ngoing to talk about it"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"is because it's seen as\nluxurious and exotic,"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"and so the chocolate\nis an aphrodisiac,"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's also what goes in

separately."},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"But they're really, really\nclosely tied together."},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"And the major reason\nfor this is the way"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"they understand

because she's"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"colder and wetter on that\nside of the humor model,"},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"are held inside the body."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"Men, being hotter,\nhave a heat force"},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"that propels them outwards."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"But they're exactly the same."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"That model does come under\nheavy criticism

things"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"that stays for much\nof era through to when"},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"the egg and the\nsperm are discovered"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"is the idea that both men\nand women

two-seed model,"},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"both men and women have seed."},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the most interesting\nthings to come out of that"},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"is the way that the
