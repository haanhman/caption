{"2":{"dur":4,"text":"Hello. My name is Emma, and in today's\nvideo, I am going to teach you"},"7":{"dur":3,"text":"all about how we use\nour hands in English."},"11":{"dur":3,"text":"So there are many ways we use our\nhands in English. I'm going to"},"14":{"dur":5,"text":"teach you a lot of different ways we use them.\nA lot of students get very confused with this,"},"19":{"dur":5,"text":"because the way we use our hands varies from\nculture to culture, so what we do in Canada"},"25":{"dur":6,"text":"and England and the U.S. might be very different\nthan with what you do in your country. Okay?"},"32":{"dur":3,"text":"So pay close attention\nto these differences."},"35":{"dur":4,"text":"So to start with, let's\nlook at: \"knock on wood\"."},"40":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're living in an\nEnglish-speaking country,"},"42":{"dur":7,"text":"you may have noticed sometimes people have a\nwooden object or a desk, a table, something"},"49":{"dur":3,"text":"made of wood, and\nthey knock on it."},"53":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay? You might wonder: \"What\ndoes this mean, knock on wood?\""},"58":{"dur":7,"text":"In English tradition, if you say\nsomething good, for example:"},"65":{"dur":6,"text":"\"I did very, very well on my test. I\nkilled my test. I did amazing on my test\","},"71":{"dur":5,"text":"you might knock on wood to make\nsure that you don't jinx it. Okay?"},"77":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll give you another example."},"79":{"dur":7,"text":"Imagine if I want to go on a picnic, and I'm\na little afraid about rain, I might say:"},"86":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Oh, you know, today's supposed to\nbe a very sunny day. Knock on wood.\""},"91":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm knocking on wood to prevent rain.\nOkay? So it's a superstition"},"96":{"dur":6,"text":"we do in order to kind of\nprotect ourselves from the"},"102":{"dur":5,"text":"opposite happening. Okay?\nOne last example:"},"108":{"dur":3,"text":"-\"How did your interview go? How\ndid your job interview go?\""},"111":{"dur":3,"text":"-\"Oh, it went well.\"\n[Knocks] Okay,"},"114":{"dur":3,"text":"so that's why we knock on\nwood, it's a superstition."},"119":{"dur":3,"text":"All right, let's look at some\nof these other ones. \"Quotes\"."},"123":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of students have asked\nme: \"What does this mean?\""},"127":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay? So, for example,\nsomebody might say:"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Yeah, she's beautiful.\""},"133":{"dur":3,"text":"Or: \"He's really smart.\""},"137":{"dur":4,"text":"This kind of has a sarcastic tone to it.\nIt means somebody"},"142":{"dur":6,"text":"has said somebody is beautiful, but you don't\nbelieve it. Or somebody has said somebody"},"148":{"dur":5,"text":"is smart, but you don't believe it. So if you\nhear someone saying something, and you're,"},"154":{"dur":7,"text":"you know, pretty much using their words but you\ndon't believe it, you can do quotes. Okay?"},"161":{"dur":4,"text":"Another example: \"Yeah\nthat movie was awesome.\""},"166":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay? So it means you\ndon't believe it."},"167":{"dur":5,"text":"English is fun. Your teachers\nmight tell you English is fun."},"173":{"dur":1,"text":"When you're talking\nto your friends,"},"174":{"dur":4,"text":"you might say: \"English is\nfun\", if you don't believe it."},"179":{"dur":8,"text":"All right, the next one: \"crazy\". All right?\nIn English, if we think someone is crazy,"},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"we go..."},"190":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay?"},"192":{"dur":3,"text":"So, for example: \"That guy,\nhe's very...\" [Clicks tongue]"},"196":{"dur":3,"text":"It means he's very crazy. Okay?"},"200":{"dur":5,"text":"\"Fingers crossed\". A lot of the times in English,\nwe take our fingers and we cross them, and"},"205":{"dur":6,"text":"we go like this. This means we're hoping\nsomething happens. Okay? So, for example:"},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"I hope you like this\nvideo, fingers crossed."},"215":{"dur":5,"text":"Or: I hope I did well on the\ntest, fingers crossed. Okay?"},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"So this means you hope\nsomething is happening."},"225":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, this is a little different from if you take\nyour finger and you put it behind your back."},"231":{"dur":4,"text":"If you take your finger... Your fingers\ncrossed and you put it behind your back,"},"235":{"dur":3,"text":"it means you're telling a lie.\nSo, for example:"},"239":{"dur":7,"text":"\"Oh, I loved the movie you made. The\nmovie you made was incredible.\""},"246":{"dur":4,"text":"If my fingers are behind my back,\nit means I'm lying to you."},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"\"I never talk to that guy.\""},"253":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay? Fingers behind my back,\nit means I'm lying. Okay?"},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, this one you might know, I\nthink it's a very common one:"},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"\"OK\". It can also mean:"},"266":{"dur":6,"text":"\"nice work\" or \"A-OK\". So that\nmeans something has gone well."},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"We have this one which is a very rude one.\nThis, which means..."},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"And sorry, I'm not doing this\nto you; I'm just teaching it."},"280":{"dur":5,"text":"This means \"up yours\", which\npretty much in English means"},"285":{"dur":5,"text":"\"fuck you\". Okay? So if you ever see\nsomebody going like that, it's not polite."},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"It means up yours or fuck you."},"293":{"dur":7,"text":"Oh, we have one... Two more. \"Peace sign\". Okay,\nwhen we're talking about peace in English,"},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"we often go: \"Peace.\""},"303":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is against war. In the 1960s,\nthere were people called Hippies,"},"308":{"dur":8,"text":"they were always going: \"Peace.\" This is\nvery different than the V sign, this."},"316":{"dur":7,"text":"Peace is like this, the V sign is like this. The\nV sign is something that is almost the same"},"324":{"dur":6,"text":"as this. In England, in Australia, in New\nZealand, if you do this to somebody, you're"},"330":{"dur":6,"text":"pretty much telling them: \"Fuck you.\" Okay?\nSo be careful. \"Peace\", versus \"Fuck you.\""},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"Finally: \"money\". Okay?"},"341":{"dur":4,"text":"In English, when we're talking about\nmoney, we often go like this."},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"So, for example: \"Do you have money?\nI need some money?\""},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay? So we just\ntake our fingers"},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"and we just rub them together."},"357":{"dur":6,"text":"Okay, we have this, devil's\nhorns, also known as \"rock on\"."},"364":{"dur":8,"text":"So whenever you go... If you like music, a lot of the times\nif you go to a rock concert, you go like this, you do this"},"372":{"dur":6,"text":"when you like the music. Okay? And it means\n\"rock on\". So this one has to do with music."},"380":{"dur":7,"text":"Okay, \"come here\". In Western culture,\nwhen we want somebody to come, we go..."},"388":{"dur":5,"text":"This is different than in other cultures.\nSome cultures, it's like this."},"394":{"dur":5,"text":"We don't do that in Western culture. Our\nhand is up, and we... We call forward."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"If we want someone to\nhurry, we might go..."},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay? So we use that\nto say: \"Come here.\""},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"We also have... This is\nsometimes almost like"},"411":{"dur":4,"text":"a negative \"come here\", like you're in\ntrouble, if I go, I take my fingers,"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"I have just the one\nup and I go..."},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"It means: \"Come here\", but usually\nparents will do this or maybe"},"423":{"dur":8,"text":"your boss, and sometimes... Well, it often\nmeans you're in trouble or there's a problem."},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay?"},"433":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, \"me\". Now, in different cultures, we\npoint to different areas of our self when"},"438":{"dur":4,"text":"we're talking about ourselves. In\nWestern culture, we point to our chest."},"443":{"dur":5,"text":"Me. In some cultures, people\npoint to their noses. Me."},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"In Western culture, we don't do\nthat; we point to our chest. Me."},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay? We also have:"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"\"I don't know\","},"457":{"dur":4,"text":"or \"I don't understand\",\nor \"I don't care.\""},"461":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay? So I shrug can mean \"I\ndon't know\/I don't care.\""},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Please\/I beg you\"."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"If you want somebody to do something,\nyou can put your hands together,"},"474":{"dur":7,"text":"like this, and say: \"Please, please, please.\nI beg you. Please keep practicing English."},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"Please keep watching\nengVid.\" Okay?"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's something we\ncan do to mean \"please\""},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"or \"I beg you\", which is\npretty much the same thing."},"491":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, this one: \"shoot me now\".\nShoot is what you do with a gun,"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"so we take our gun, and"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"we just pretend to...\n[Shooting noise]."},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay? Shoot me now. We\noften do this when we're"},"503":{"dur":6,"text":"bored. Okay? So if you're watching a very\nboring... If you have a very boring class,"},"509":{"dur":6,"text":"or somebody is... You're watching something\nvery boring, you might say: [Shooting noise],"},"515":{"dur":6,"text":"which means: \"Please kill me. Shoot me now.\"\nOr if something is really terrible, like maybe"},"522":{"dur":5,"text":"you did really bad on an assignment:\n\"Ah, please shoot me now.\""},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"Finally we have:"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"\"call me\". Okay? This means:"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Call my cellphone or\ncall my telephone.\""},"536":{"dur":6,"text":"Okay? So now let's look at some more expressions\nwe use with our hands, some more gestures,"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"and what they mean in English."},"545":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, so the next expression I want\nto teach you with your hands is:"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"\"It went over my head.\""},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay? So it's when\nyou go: \"Whoo\"."},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"What this means is that\nsomething is so difficult, and"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"complex, and confusing,\nyou don't understand."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"So, for example, when\nI think about math,"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"whoo,"},"567":{"dur":6,"text":"it means math is very difficult; I don't\nunderstand it. Or if I think about, you know,"},"574":{"dur":6,"text":"certain science principles, maybe, you\nknow, I might not understand them, so"},"580":{"dur":5,"text":"it goes over my head. It means I don't\nunderstand because it's too difficult."},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"I hope you don't do this,"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"but some of you might\nthink about English,"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"whoo. Okay?"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"Or English grammar,\nand that means"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"it's so difficult it\nwent over my head."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, we also have \"thumbs up\"."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"You do this if\nsomething is good."},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"In some cultures, I think it\nmight mean something different,"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"but in Western culture,\nthis means good."},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"We also have \"thumbs down\",\nwhich means bad. Okay? So:"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"\"How was your presentation?\""},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"It means-okay-\"It was terrible.\""},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay? We have:"},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"Shh. \"Be quiet.\" Shh."},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"We also have: \"What?\" This\nmeans the opposite; it means"},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"\"speak louder\"."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay? \"I can't hear you,\nplease speak louder.\""},"636":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, the next one: You're dead, is when\nyou take your finger and you go: \"Kee\"."},"642":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay? So if you want to tell\nsomebody they're dead: \"Kee\". Okay."},"648":{"dur":6,"text":"We also have another threat. If somebody makes\nyou really angry... Well, I'm not saying to"},"655":{"dur":6,"text":"do this, but if you see someone go like this,\nshaking their fist, and they have a very angry"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"face, like... It means:"},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"\"I'll get you\", or it can also\nmean, like, you know, \"Fuck you.\""},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay? And it's done high up."},"673":{"dur":8,"text":"Okay. Now, one thing we do in English, this, can\nmean two things. If you see the police officer"},"682":{"dur":4,"text":"and they have their gun out, and you go:\n\"Whoa!\" This can mean: \"Don't shoot.\""},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay? \"Don't shoot your gun.\""},"689":{"dur":5,"text":"It can also mean: \"Relax.\" Okay?\n\"Calm down.\" So, if somebody"},"694":{"dur":6,"text":"is very angry at you, if somebody's yelling\nat you, they're very angry: \"Whoa!\" Okay?"},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"It means: \"Whoa, calm\ndown\" or \"relax\"."},"706":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, this is an important one.\nIt means \"let's drink\"."},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay? So I might\nsay to somebody:"},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Hey, today, let's get\nbeer or let's drink.\""},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"If you point to somebody,\nthough, and if you go:"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"\"That guy\", [clicks tongue],"},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"depending on how you do\nyour face, it can also mean"},"729":{"dur":6,"text":"that person drinks too much. So when you go\nlike this, it usually has to do with alcohol."},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"It can mean either:\n\"Yeah, let's drink.\" or"},"739":{"dur":5,"text":"\"That guy, he drinks too\nmuch; he's an alcoholic.\""},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay? Next, we have the\nword \"hitch-hike\"."},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"Hitch-hike is when you need\nto get somewhere, so you"},"753":{"dur":5,"text":"put your thumb out and you're on the road, and\nhopefully if you do this, a car will come"},"759":{"dur":6,"text":"and pick you up. So it's a way to travel.\nWhen you don't have transportation, you can"},"765":{"dur":6,"text":"put your thumb out if there's a road, and\nsomebody in a car may pick you up. That's"},"772":{"dur":6,"text":"called hitch-hiking. Okay? So in some cultures\nsomething like this is rude; in English if"},"778":{"dur":5,"text":"you're walking on the street and you do this,\nit means: \"Please pick me up in your car.\""},"784":{"dur":7,"text":"Okay, this one is also a very, very important\none. If you go to a restaurant and you want"},"791":{"dur":7,"text":"to pay for your meal, sometimes the waitress\nor the server, they take a very long time"},"799":{"dur":5,"text":"to come, so what you can do is you can make\neye contact with your waiter or waitress,"},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"and you can go..."},"807":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay? So you pretend this is a\npen, this is a paper, that means:"},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Cheque, please.\" or\n\"The bill, please.\""},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"So you don't even have to say\nanything; you can just look."},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"It means: \"Please\ngive me the bill.\""},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, if you want something done\nfast, we say: \"Snap, snap.\""},"826":{"dur":5,"text":"Snap, snap means do it quickly,\ndo it very fast. Okay?"},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, I finished my\nhomework snap, snap. It means"},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"I did it very quickly."},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"Or: \"Get me a coffee.\"\n[Snaps fingers] Snap, snap."},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Get me a coffee very quickly.\""},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, we have this\none: \"go away\"."},"847":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay? So, you know, our... Our...\nThe back of our hand,"},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"and it pushes away."},"854":{"dur":6,"text":"Okay, this one you might see if you ever watch\nthe Oscars or some sort of award ceremony,"},"860":{"dur":6,"text":"maybe a baseball game or a hockey game, you\nmight see somebody clasp their hands together,"},"866":{"dur":5,"text":"so they put their hands together and they\nshake them, and they shake them. Okay?"},"872":{"dur":4,"text":"This means: \"Yay, we won.\" Okay?\n\"We won the award.\""},"877":{"dur":6,"text":"or \"Yay, I won the game.\nWe won the hockey game.\""},"883":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is kind of victory or,\nyou know: \"We won, we won.\""},"889":{"dur":6,"text":"Okay, the next one: \"blah, blah\".\nIn English, \"blah, blah\" means..."},"895":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, it doesn't really mean anything. We\nuse it when someone is talking too much,"},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"and we say: \"Blah, blah,\nblah, blah, blah.\" Okay?"},"903":{"dur":5,"text":"So it just means a person is talking\ntoo much. So we might take our hand"},"908":{"dur":5,"text":"and go: \"Blah, blah, blah, blah\", and it means,\nyou know, this is what this person sounds"},"913":{"dur":3,"text":"like, blah, blah. It means\nthey're talking too much,"},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"and we don't really care\nwhat they're saying."},"921":{"dur":5,"text":"This: \"loser\". A loser is\nsomeone who is not cool. Okay?"},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"So a loser is somebody\nwho is not cool."},"929":{"dur":4,"text":"In the 90s, although some people do this,\nbut really in the 1990s, if you went"},"934":{"dur":6,"text":"like this, it meant... So you make an \"L\" and\nyou go like that. It meant you were insulting"},"941":{"dur":5,"text":"somebody, it meant you were calling them a\nloser, or somebody who isn't successful and"},"947":{"dur":6,"text":"who is stupid, pretty much. So if you go\nlike that, it's an insult in English."},"954":{"dur":5,"text":"It's not so common anymore, but it was\nsomething that was very big in the 1990s."},"961":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, finally: \"anticipation\"."},"963":{"dur":4,"text":"Anticipation means we are\nexcited for something. Okay?"},"968":{"dur":4,"text":"So imagine Christmas is\ncoming: \"Oo, I can't wait.\""},"973":{"dur":3,"text":"Or, you know, the new Ironman\nmovie is coming out:"},"977":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Oo, this is so exciting.\""},"980":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, I'm going to get to\nwatch another engVid video:"},"983":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Oo, I can't wait.\""},"985":{"dur":3,"text":"So we use this to mean\nanticipation or excitement. We're"},"988":{"dur":4,"text":"very excited for something, we can\nrub our hands together, like this."},"993":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, the last one I want to teach\nyou, this. It's from Star Trek,"},"999":{"dur":2,"text":"and it means \"live\nlong and prosper\"."},"1002":{"dur":5,"text":"So for anyone who's a Star Trek fan,\nthis is a very big hand gesture a lot"},"1007":{"dur":8,"text":"of people do in English society and I guess\nworldwide, showing that they're a fan of the"},"1016":{"dur":2,"text":"TV show and the movie Star Trek."},"1018":{"dur":3,"text":"So I hope you've\nenjoyed this video."},"1022":{"dur":3,"text":"Again, we use our hands\na lot to communicate."},"1025":{"dur":3,"text":"They say that 80% of language\nis actually body language,"},"1029":{"dur":2,"text":"so it's really\nimportant to learn"},"1032":{"dur":2,"text":"the different things your hands\ncan do and what they mean,"},"1035":{"dur":2,"text":"because in some cultures,"},"1038":{"dur":3,"text":"certain things might be offensive;\nbut in other cultures, they're not."},"1042":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay? So it's important to know\nwhat is offensive in English,"},"1045":{"dur":3,"text":"for example, this is\noffensive; versus:"},"1048":{"dur":4,"text":"What is something that is\nnot offensive, like this?"},"1052":{"dur":3,"text":"This is totally fine to\ndo in English.
