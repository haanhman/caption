they spoke the word of the Lord to him\nand to all of the others in the house."},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"And at that hour of the night, the jailer\ntook them and washed their wounds, and then"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"immediately he and his household were baptized."},"770":{"dur":4,"text":"The jailer brought them into his house and\nset a meal before them, and he was

it."},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"It's joy in the midst of suffering."},"855":{"dur":5,"text":"And when it came to suffering, Paul and Silas,\nthey were no strangers."},"861":{"dur":5,"text":"Do you know how Paul and Silas wound up in\nprison in the first place?"},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"Because they healed a girl."},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"The nerve, right?"},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, there was a girl who was overcome with\nspirits."},"872":{"dur":1,"text":"They prayed over her."},"873":{"dur":1,"text":"She was healed."},"875":{"dur":8,"text":"And because of that, they were beaten with\nrods,

were doing\nin verse 25?"},"937":{"dur":3,"text":"They were praying and singing hymns to God."},"940":{"dur":6,"text":"And the other prisoners, who probably knew\nwhy they were there, they were listening."},"947":{"dur":1,"text":"They were paying attention."},"948":{"dur":5,"text":"And Paul and Silas, they are teaching us the\nfirst thing that we need to do if we
