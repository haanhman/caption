the losses\nthat my wife and I experienced"},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"in the dreams that we had for our sons."},"251":{"dur":4,"text":"I realized at that point\nthat I could not be helpful to my

Dads fix things,\nand I wanted to fix this for Matthew."},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"So my plan was fairly simple."},"329":{"dur":4,"text":"I figured I'd put together a fundraising\ncommittee, raise some money,"},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"we'll buy and we'll install a lift"},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"so that Matthew could stay in school\nwith his siblings and with his friends."},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"The school was supported by a church."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"I figured, well, geez, everybody\nwould be on board with this."},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"To me, the only challenge\nwould be in raising the money."},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, when I'm wrong,\nthere's no depth to how wrong I can be."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"We were granted permission\nto raise money,"},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"although the

by the local community\nand the local media,"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"but was abruptly stopped,"},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"and Matthew was left\non the outside, looking in."},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"It was almost\nas if they were saying to us:"},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"\"We don't like what you're doing.\nYou don't fit, please go away.\""},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"My family was really challenged\nat that point,"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"as I tried to mediate a solution,"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"but unfortunately,\nthere was none to be had."},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"And I stopped the fundraiser,"},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"and the committee returned the money\nto all the people who had made donations."},"403":{"dur":4,"text":"My wife and I were interested\nonly in putting this nightmare behind us,"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"but I'm thinking to myself,\nall along at this time was -"},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"this is an organization that has turned\ntheir backs on a little boy"},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"whose family wanted him\nto attend their school,"},"420":{"dur":5,"text":"as well as the community, who financially\nand publicly supported this plan."},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"We filed a successful complaint\nwith the main Human Rights Commission,"},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"and to make this long story short,"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"the school

running."},"471":{"dur":4,"text":"But before that, let me talk about\nMatthew and Patrick a little more."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"So Matthew and Patrick,\nwhen they were little,"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"and they heard about muscular dystrophy,"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"my family was really concerned with\ntheir ability to continue to move forward,"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"and to be able to do\nthe things they wanted to do."},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"So we told them about advocacy,"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"the importance of self-advocacy."},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"And I always told them to do it\nin an appropriate manner"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"because I said to them"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"that they would not be able\nto expect people to help them,"},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"if it was expected,\nand that people wouldn't want to do so."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"And even at a time when we thought,"},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"that Matthew and Patrick wouldn't be able\nto survive beyond their high school years,"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"I always told them\nthey would go to college."},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"And so Matthew and Patrick were always\ntold that they would attend college,"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"and that sitting on the couch\nat home playing video games,"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"was not my idea\nof an appropriate vocation."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"Matthew attended\nthe University of New England,"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"and was studying political science."},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"Patrick, too,\nhas been very involved in school."},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"The one thing that I admire most\nabout him is his love of music,"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"Patrick's passion for playing piano."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"I truly enjoy listening to him play it,"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"probably as much as he enjoys playing."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"So again, going back\nto what keeps me on goal,"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"is the techniques I have learned\nin distance running."},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"This helps me to stay focused on my tasks."},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"I've run 17 marathons;\nI'm 52 years of age."},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge\nin New York City,"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"leading from Staten Island to Brooklyn."},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"I ran this race four different times,\ntwice when I was 50."},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"The first time was when\nI turned 50 years old, on my birthday,"},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"and the second time was\nthe day before I turned 51."},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"It was quite a privilege,"},"587":{"dur":5,"text":"to be able to run with 48,000\nof my closest friends on my birthday."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"A marathon is 26.2 miles,"},"597":{"dur":4,"text":"and I never really think about\nthat distance, until I board the bus"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"that takes the runners\nfrom the finish line to the start."},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"Then I think to myself,"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Oh crap, what am I doing now?\""},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"But the same principles apply."},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"I've got to be prepared."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"I cannot go to the race start"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"and expect to do well\nunless I'm properly ready."},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"Unless I've run several 18 or 20 milers,"},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm not going to feel\nas though I am fully prepared,"},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"and I apply the same principles\nto the activities in which I am involved."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"And even then, I break those up\ninto smaller components."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't get out the morning of a long run,"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"and think about the entire distance,"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"I break it up into five-mile components,"},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"and don't worry about the next one,\nuntil I finish the previous."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"And then at the end,\nI start counting backwards."},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"I've got eight miles left,\nI've got seven miles left."},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"I apply these same principles to all\nthe activities that I'm involved with,"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"so that it doesn't become overwhelming."},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"15 years ago, my family learned\nmy sons had Duchenne muscular dystrophy."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"Just four weeks ago, we lost Matthew."},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"Matthew died from heart failure\nbecause of his muscular dystrophy."},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"I've loved my family\nmore deeply than anything else,"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"and Matthew's loss has been\nvery, very difficult for me."},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"A week later,"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"I was speaking in Massachusetts\nat a pharmaceutical company,"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"about clinical trials\nrelated to muscular dystrophy,"},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"and the following week, I was\nin New York City, working on a website"},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"for families developing resources\nfor muscular dystrophy."},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"I love Matthew dearly, but I realize also"},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"that the disorder that took his life\ndoesn't take a holiday."},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"Neither will I."},"715":{"dur":4,"text":"I enjoy being an advocate,\nbeing involved, and volunteering."},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"I ask you to consider doing\nthe same thing,"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"and a lot of people will claim\nthat there's not enough time that day."},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, I'm here to tell you"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"there are 24 hours\nin each and everyday for all of us,"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"and how you manage that time"},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"is the difference between\nbeing successful in that or not."},"738":{"dur":6,"text":"So finally, let me say\nthat please consider being involved,"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"set more aggressive goals,"},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"come up with a plan that allows you\nto complete those goals."},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"Look to successful people."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"When you're knocked down, get back up."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"With a successful person,\ndid they stop when they failed?"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"Or did they keep going\nin believing in themselves?"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"In my life I've made a few waves,"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"and I hope to be able to continue."},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"And I ask that you consider\ndoing the same."},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you very much."},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"(Applause)"}}
