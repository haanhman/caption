that we\nhad faculty members from law,"},"1203":{"dur":3,"text":"from economics, from public\nhealth, et cetera involved."},"1206":{"dur":3,"text":"And that is working\nquite successfully."},"1209":{"dur":3,"text":"Interestingly, it has\nturned out that this"},"1212":{"dur":3,"text":"has been very easy to raise\nphilanthropic money for."},"1216":{"dur":2,"text":"And so to

the center,"},"1425":{"dur":2,"text":"we currently have 12 FTE."},"1428":{"dur":3,"text":"But there are many more, a\nlarge number of endowed chairs."},"1431":{"dur":4,"text":"And we, in essence, have turned\nequity and inclusion from,"},"1436":{"dur":2,"text":"if you like social\nprograms at universities,"},"1438":{"dur":2,"text":"to genuine academic programs."},"1440":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're

course,"},"2487":{"dur":3,"text":"that we are, as I said earlier,\ndealing with the parents."},"2491":{"dur":1,"text":"Because one of\nthings that we know"},"2492":{"dur":2,"text":"from AAUW's own research\nin the Why So Few?"},"2495":{"dur":4,"text":"report is that parental\nattitudes, parental notions"},"2499":{"dur":2,"text":"about what kind of work\nis appropriate for

a\nconversation with parents"},"2511":{"dur":2,"text":"and actually working\nthrough some of those issues"},"2513":{"dur":1,"text":"can really make a difference."},"2515":{"dur":1,"text":"The other thing, of\ncourse, that we've seen"},"2516":{"dur":2,"text":"is that when you\ntalk about trying"},"2519":{"dur":2,"text":"to get more girls into\nSTEM, you actually"},"2521":{"dur":3,"text":"need to start talking\nabout middle schoolers."},"2525":{"dur":2,"text":"Because if they haven't\nstarted taking the math"},"2528":{"dur":1,"text":"classes in middle\nschool,

put"},"2582":{"dur":2,"text":"in as a recommendation,\nwhich I thought"},"2584":{"dur":2,"text":"made a lot of sense, especially\ngiven what Heidi just"},"2586":{"dur":3,"text":"talked about, was the way\nthat the government structures"},"2590":{"dur":1,"text":"its grants."},"2591":{"dur":1,"text":"And one of the things\nthat-- we actually"},"2592":{"dur":2,"text":"have a bill that we're
