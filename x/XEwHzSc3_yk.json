standing"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"there."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"Sure."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"Sure."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"So the association happens and people have\na hard time shaking a first

this."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"There's these -- what's the name of this?"},"574":{"dur":4,"text":"It's like regressive hypnosis therapy where\nthey basically are programing people to

I have a version of that."},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"When I was learning hypnosis, we had to practice\non real people and it was better if you charged"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"them because one of the things you learn in\nhypnosis is if somebody pays for something,"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"they give it more credibility."},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"Sure."},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"And once they've given

question."},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"And by the way, it wasn't even an answer to\nthe question."},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"Sure."},"817":{"dur":4,"text":"It was just something he said that was sort\nof related."},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"Now what's beautiful about that is that Rosie\nO'Donnell is a character that the Republican"},"825":{"dur":4,"text":"base, the people who cared about the primaries,\nhave a strong feeling about."},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"So he immediately got emotion on his side."},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"He was against her, then they must be on his\nside

yeah."},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"And so you imagine her, right?"},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"So this will be a theme you'll probably hear\na few more times in our time

words\nthat we don't have a person to put to, you"},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"know it's just sort of --"},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"It's an abstract concept."},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"-- abstract."},"860":{"dur":8,"text":"He just moved that off the page with his perfect\nvisual, emotion-attracting reference."},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"And I literally stood up."},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"I just said, \"Okay, that's not normal.\""},"871":{"dur":1,"text":"Right."},"872":{"dur":6,"text":"That's the best you've ever seen anybody handle\nany question -- a hard

about everything\nthat came before that because he'd managed"},"909":{"dur":1,"text":"to just dodge that entirely"},"910":{"dur":4,"text":"Yeah, and then he used it as his platform\nto talk about political correctness."},"915":{"dur":5,"text":"And I have to admit, when I first heard him\ntalk about that, I thought, \"Well, people"},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"have been talking about political correctness\nforever, and it's never really gotten any"},"924":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of purchase.\""},"925":{"dur":1,"text":"But he made it such a brand

specifically\nat credibility targets."},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"So he'll say something like, \"Check your facts,\"\nand then he'll name the person."},"953":{"dur":5,"text":"So now you're associating,
