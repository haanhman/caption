to deliver content."},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"So you know, you\ngo past a statue,"},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"and you swipe your phone,\nas long as you've got"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"it enabled, and you

to ensure\nthat we got coverage."},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we did-- it\nwas a tricky thing."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"We had to break the\nstory ahead of time,"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"before anybody else\ncould break it,"},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"because there were\nso many people."},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"So we had a preview piece\nin the Sunday Times."},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"And then at the\ntime of the launch,"},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"it was really quite hard."},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"Because where do we launch?"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was August, and\neveryone was out of town."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"And what will the press\nactually come to see?"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have-- [?

we were on the cover\nof all sorts of things,"},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"and it was in The Standard."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"And then on the\nday of the launch,"},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"it was a

working\nclosely with them."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"And everybody came, and most\nimportant, Associated Press."},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"Because overnight, it\nwas in 300 countries."},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"And we had no physical\nthings, but we"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"had these maps, digital maps."},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"And all of our partners, all\nthe museums, got one of these,"},"520":{"dur":6,"text":"and everybody did their\nown marketing around it."},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"And at the time of the launch,\nwe launched the public writing"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"Four statues were\nwaiting to speak."},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"And people were invited\nto create monologues,"},"537":{"dur":4,"text":"and the winning ones

backgrounds"},"560":{"dur":6,"text":"came forward, and it was a\nvery high level of stuff."},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"There you go."},"569":{"dur":0,"text":"So what did we learn?"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"You've got some learnings\nabout getting all of the signs"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"around London, which\nwas a nightmare."},"574":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll go first, then."},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"So the tech learnings\nwe had were plentiful."},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"We kind of wanted this\nlow barrier to entry."},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"We also wanted to think about\nsomething outside of the app."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"So we wanted to be\nable to-- uh-oh."},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"That's going to restart the PC."},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"But we also wanted\nto kind of think"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"about how someone\ncould go out, and they"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"wouldn't have to pre-plan,\nand they could actually"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"have this surprise\nmoment with the statue."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's why we didn't\ngo the kind of app route"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"and we wanted to kind of explore\nwhat people could do just"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"with 3G and 4G networks."},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"So we really wanted to exploited\nthat serendipity kind of fact."},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"Also, we wanted to get\nthe phone call to ring."},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"We wanted to get it to surprise."},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"Now this turned into\na bit of a problem,"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"because during the\nproject, what happened"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"was both Apple and\nAndroid closed down"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"on auto-launching content."},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"So just like if you\ndo phone a kind of TV"},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"show, and you have kind\nof like a disclaimer"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"that it's going to\ncharge you for it,"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"we had to put that in\nthe project, as well."},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"So this kind of set\nthe development back,"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"and me and Collette had\na few arguments about it."},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"Because there was a\nmoment when Sam said,"},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"the phone's not going to ring."},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"And I said, no, the\nphone has to ring."},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"That is the magic."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"I've just got these\ngazillion stars."},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"The phone has to ring."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"So we worked it out,\nand we're still friends."},"645":{"dur":0,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"But we did have quite\na few kind of learnings"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"about having to put those\ndisclaimers in there, what"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"would happen if you've kind of\ngot these NFC tags out there,"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of privacy."},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"We also had a moment where\nthere was big uproar when"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"a girlfriend of someone who's\nused her boyfriend's phone"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"had to got to a adult side."},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"And there was kind\nof tweets about it,"},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"and we had to rush down\nto the British Museum"},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"to make sure that the\ntag hadn't been hacked."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"We were quite comforted\nthat it had locked."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"But it turned out that\nshe'd accidentally"},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"accessed his browsing

want"},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"to ask why and how we did it."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"And I just want to say\nthat there was no magic,"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"but there's one\nimportant thing that I"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"do think is worth passing on."},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"Which is being really\nclear about your project,"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"avoiding jargon, saying\nit in four lines--"},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"four lines that\nanybody can understand."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"So we just did it\nthrough agents,"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"but it took us ages to\nget very, very simple,"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's real value\nin that simplicity."},"710":{"dur":0,"text":"Cool."},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"We've got to hurry

here with\nus, but we have various user"},"718":{"dur":0,"text":"testing results."},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"So we not only took the data\nfrom the front-end experience"},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"about the user interactions."},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"And the idea behind\nthis, as well,"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"was how you could use an\noutreach kind of technology"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"like this to start to drive\ntraffic to other places."},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"So we were tracking\nvarious things"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"that were going on in there."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"This shows you the\npopularity of the statues."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"We've had nearly up\nto 40,000 interactions"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"with the statues already."},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"There was a

screwed."},"755":{"dur":5,"text":"Because our main-- Westminster,\nwho suddenly dug their heels in"},"760":{"dur":0,"text":"and they said no."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"And most of the statues\nare in Westminster."},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"And Parliament had\ncommissioned us to do that,"},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"and suddenly we had\nto think afield."},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was a huge\nsetback, and we"},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"had to then look at statues\nin much more remote places."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"We also-- Leicester\nhit the streets,"},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"so they were kind of out\nthere measuring interactions"},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"and actually speaking to people\nwho were doing interactions."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"And they've written a full\nwhite paper

differently-- differently is\nwe realised that some of them"},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"were too long."},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's very hard to go to\nvery famous writers and
