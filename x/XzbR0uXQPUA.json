really aren't this\nthing that we created at the"},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"top of the company\nand passed down."},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"It's something that really\ncame from the bottom up."},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"And these core values are what\nwe hire and fire against."},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"And as we evolved over time at\nZappos, we really started to"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"think more about how those\napplied at scale."},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's important to remember\nas we evolve through"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"the talk today."},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"So we have this thing at Zappos\nwe call the three C's--"},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"clothing, customer, service,\nand culture."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"And those are three things\nwe focus the most on."},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"Clothing really came out of this\nidea that we wanted to"},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"grow out of being\na shoe company."},"347":{"dur":4,"text":"And even today, if you go on\nZappos, 90% of you will see on"},"352":{"dur":1,"text":"the home page will probably\nnot be shoes."},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"We're housewares, bags,\nand much, much more."},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"That recipe, those three C's,\nand that focus on culture, as"},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"you guys know, propelled us not\nonly to over $1

acquired by"},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"Amazon.com."},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"But through the processes, it\nremained very independent."},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"And a big part of that is\nbecause of our core values and"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"our focus on culture."},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"Currently, we live on\nthis really kind"},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"of nondescript campus."},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"I was talking this morning about\nhow the multi-building"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"campus structure can be\nreally challenging."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"And for us at Zappos, we've\ngrown out of this-- number"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"one, this was our\nbuilding two."},"390":{"dur":3,"text":"Building one was really for\nabout 150 people, and then"},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"300, and then we took the next\nfloor, and then the second"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"building, the next floor, and\nthe third building, which"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"became like Siberia where people\ngo to work, and you"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"don't see them for four months,\nand you wonder, when"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"you see them, how long, maybe\nthey've been on vacation."},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"You're surprised they\nstill work there."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what we've been able to\ndo at Zappos with our culture"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"has been in spite of the\nbuilding that we're in."},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"So through the course of the\nlast about seven or eight"},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"years, really kind of starting\nwhen we went to the second"},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"floor of the Henderson campus,\nit was really important to"},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"think about how we could get\neverybody under one roof."},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"We aren't growing as fast, from\na headcount standpoint,"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"So we can think about maybe\none gigantic building."},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"And that might last\nus 15 years."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"For you, that would probably\nlast you about 15 days."},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"But at Zappos, we could really\nthink about a corporate campus"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"that's maybe three times of\nwhat we have today as"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"something we can think of\nas a 30 year investment."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"So we started looking\nat campuses."},"441":{"dur":0,"text":"We looked at Nike."},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"We came here."},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"We were inspired by what Apple's\ndoing in Cupertino, by"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"the spaceship-like object."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"It looks like it's just going\nto take off one day."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reason we really liked\nis probably one of the main"},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"reasons you like this campus."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the prevalence of all these\nservices, these things"},"458":{"dur":4,"text":"that not only keep you here from\n7:00 AM to midnight, but"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"really do make your life a\nlittle bit better-- the bar,"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"the sushi place, the park,\nthe things to do."},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"And that really goes\nto the heart of a"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"lifestyle of a company."},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"And as we thought about it, we\nthought, yeah, we want the"},"471":{"dur":0,"text":"Yoga studio."},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"And in the Nike campus,\nthey have a pub."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"And around the edge, they\nhave a running track."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"And we thought, yeah that's\nactually what we want, too--"},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"We really don't care about\nthe running track part."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"And the more we thought about\nit, though, we thought, this"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"feels like the same thing\neveryone else is doing."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"But for some reason, every time\nwe go to somewhere like"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"New York, we're really inspired\nby the overlap"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"between a student at NYU, and a\nperson working in a company,"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"and the people that interact and\nrun into each other from"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"different backgrounds."},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"We like this concept of a busy\nstorefront and a busy street,"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"people interacting in ways\nthat they didn't plan,"},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"co-working spaces, the concept\nof being able to just camp out"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"and not necessarily be inside of\nyour campus, and ultimately"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"this is the photo that we looked\nat, which kind of looks"},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"like one of micro\nmachines photos."},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"But it really sort of gets to\nthe heart of how we see a"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"vision for how a\ncity operates."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"It's these collisions and this\ndensity that creates these"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"opportunities for amazing\nthings to happen."},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reason that mattered was\nwe were thinking about the"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"growth of the company, and\nwhen you get to a certain"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"point, we were currently in\nabout 1,500 employees."},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"When you get to a certain point,\nyou begin to lose that"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"happiness, and that innovation,\nand that"},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"productivity."},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"A lot of middle managers\ncome in."},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"People get siloed."},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"They are in three different\nbuildings."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"Lots of things happen that\nultimately drive down the"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"reason why we get up and go to\nwork in the first place, which"},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"is to be happy."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we found, when we looked\nat research on cities,"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"which happened to be a very--"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"it was very just sort of random\nthing a few of us were"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"reading about, we realized that\nthe exact opposite is"},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"true for cities."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"As a city doubles in size,\nproductivity and happiness"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"increases by 15%."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's not all true\nfor companies."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"So our thought was, what would\nhappen if we took the lessons"},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"of Zappos and applied them to\nthe work we think of a city"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"could use it to invest in\nculture in the spirit of"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"optimism and happiness but also\ntake the lessons of the"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"city and apply them\nto a company."},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"And a few different bodies of\nresearch, Jane Jacobs, Ed"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"Glaeser, which I'll talk about\nin a minute, and many, many"},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"others, we found there were\nthree key elements to creating"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"this environment of serendipity\nthat really makes"},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"a city magical."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"That's residential density of at\nleast 100 people per acre,"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"street level activity, the\nkind of things you see"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"happening here is kind of a\nversion of the street level"},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"activity, and a culture of\nopenness and collaboration."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"When you look at, historically,\nback to Rome all"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"the way through the successful\ncities of the last 1,000"},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"years, the things that the\ncities that made it through"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"the hard times were cities that\nhad those elements 100%"},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"of the time."},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"Cities that didn't, like\nDetroit, took an element like"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"number two and said, no, we'll\nbuild an elevated train and"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"put all the activity\nabove the ground."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"And ultimately, that small\ndecision, which was designed"},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"for convenience to connect\ndifferent people from"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"different parts of the city,\nultimately drove down the"},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"culture of innovation."},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a good idea, but it was\na key contributor to the"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"failure of the core\nof Detroit."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"So we thought, how can we take\nall these things, wrap them up"},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"into one, one recipe,\nand invest in our"},"649":{"dur":0,"text":"company going forward."},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"And we recognize that a key\npart of Zappos culture was"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"maximizing serendipitous\ninteractions--"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"having one door in\nand one door out."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"We liked the concept of density\nin the office--"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"partially because we were cheap,\nand we were all kind of"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"crammed on top of each other,\nbut more and more the research"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"that we realized that the\ndensity in an office, the"},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"typical 200 square feet per\nperson, was actually something"},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"that was causing a lot of\nrifts between people."},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"So we felt that we could take\nsome of the density ideas that"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"could make a city successful,\napply them to our company, and"},"680":{"dur":4,"text":"ultimately make decisions that\nallowed people to connect more"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"freely and prioritize collisions\nover convenience."},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll show you an example\nabout that in a minute."},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"So the thing about downtown\nLas Vegas, it was going to"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"sort of serendipitous\nthat a bunch of us"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"We were in a sort of\nnameless city."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"Vegas is a place, we were just\ntalking about it over lunch--"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"Vegas is a place that no one\nfeels like belongs to them."},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"You live in someone\nelse's city."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"If you've ever visited Vegas\nas a tourist, you"},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of take over."},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"And when you live in Vegas,\nyou feel that power coming"},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"from the strip."},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"We found this little enclave\nin downtown Las Vegas, this"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"two block area that had a really\namazing coffee shop, a"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"lot of really cool things\nhappening with a very small"},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"group of people from the arts\narea, from the creative area,"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"from the music space."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"And we said this is actually a\nplace we want to hang out."},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"So a few of us were"},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"independently hanging out there."},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"And as we were thinking about\nthe evolution of the campus,"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"we discovered this building,\nwhich is, it's not like you"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"can't see it from a mile away."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"But we discovered the building\nthat would soon become the"},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"former Las Vegas City Hall\nwas becoming available."},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"And we thought that was\ninteresting because, one, it"},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"was about twice as large our\ncurrent office, which made a"},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"lot of sense for us."},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"And two, it included about five\nacres of property, which"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"would allow us to expand\nover time."},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"So this idea of creating an\nurban center for our company"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"was something that was actually\nwithin our reach,"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"instead of going out to the\ndesert and building a really"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"great but, ultimately,\nlonely campus."},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"Bars like Downtown Cocktail\nRoom, which I highly suggest"},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"you visit if you come to Vegas,\nor the Beat, which is"},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"the center of activity in\ndowntown Vegas, upstairs and"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"behind it, is emergency arts,\nwhich provides 100 to two"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"square feet for artists to have\nsmall galleries for $200"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"to $300 a month, which is the\nfirst time in Vegas that"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"independent artist have the\nopportunity to

into."},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"So we started thinking a lot\nabout the way that Apple"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"campus looked, but started\ntaking the same things that we"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"saw there and saying, well,\nhow do we bring those to a"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"city and ultimately flip\nour campus inside out?"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"Take what we'd normally put in\nthe courtyard, and put it on"},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"the street, and make it\nopen to everybody."},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"What would happen\nif we did that?"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"And on the way, we came up with\nthis idea that maybe we"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"should start thinking a bit more\nabout the community as a"},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"part of what we're doing\nin our

investing in things\nlike the inspired theater to"},"2543":{"dur":3,"text":"support the speaker series on,\nnot only a daily basis, but an"},"2546":{"dur":3,"text":"hourly, or half hour basis,\nwhere you always know you can"},"2549":{"dur":2,"text":"walk right on it at any point in\nthe day, and there'll be an"},"2551":{"dur":2,"text":"interesting talk by someone\nwho has something to

creepy."},"2562":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what actually ended up\nhappening was we accidentally"},"2565":{"dur":2,"text":"created this cadence\nof things."},"2568":{"dur":2,"text":"So first, it was about trying\nto consolidate all these"},"2571":{"dur":2,"text":"amazing people in tech to come\non one week so they ran into"},"2573":{"dur":0,"text":"each other."},"2574":{"dur":2,"text":"And then once they did that,\nwe realized there was a lot"},"2576":{"dur":1,"text":"more magic that was happening\nthan we could"},"2577":{"dur":1,"text":"ever possibly create."},"2579":{"dur":1,"text":"So we start theming\nevery week."},"2581":{"dur":1,"text":"Week one is First Friday\nof the Arts Festival."},"2583":{"dur":1,"text":"Week two is Tech\nCocktail Week."},"2584":{"dur":2,"text":"Week three is

of\neverything else, Catalyst is"},"2593":{"dur":1,"text":"about inspiring a different\nway of thinking."},"2595":{"dur":2,"text":"It's sort of like a mini-Ted."},"2597":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we did that."},"2599":{"dur":3,"text":"And we realized, well, people\nasked, well, what are you"},"2603":{"dur":1,"text":"doing to bring people here\nover the long term?"},"2605":{"dur":1,"text":"And that got us thinking, well,\nwhat does it actually"},"2606":{"dur":1,"text":"mean to be a resident\nof a city?"},"2608":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is a simple\nmathematical calculation."},"2610":{"dur":3,"text":"If you take in travel, and life,\nand different things you"},"2613":{"dur":3,"text":"have to do, you, generally\nspeaking, for most of

take out laundry, and\nerrands, and so forth."},"2626":{"dur":2,"text":"So this question came from a\nguy named Jake, who, at the"},"2629":{"dur":2,"text":"time, had the biggest\nfashion-related

showing."},"2639":{"dur":3,"text":"But the question from him was, I\nwant to be a part of this on"},"2642":{"dur":1,"text":"But I can't be here 100%."},"2644":{"dur":0,"text":"I have a family."},"2645":{"dur":2,"text":"I have a warehouse\nin New York."},"2647":{"dur":1,"text":"Is there a middle ground?"},"2648":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we thought for a second,\nwhat does it mean to"},"2650":{"dur":4,"text":"actually be a purposeful person\nin a community versus a"},"2654":{"dur":1,"text":"dedicated person?"},"2656":{"dur":2,"text":"So we did a little map\ncalculation and found that,"},"2658":{"dur":4,"text":"essentially, if you come for\nthree or four days a week, 12"},"2663":{"dur":2,"text":"times a year, your collisionable\nhour is when"},"2665":{"dur":1,"text":"you're more purposeful, you\ndon't have errands to run."},"2667":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't have kids to pick up,\nyou're actually about as"},"2669":{"dur":3,"text":"collisionable as I am by coming\nonce a month versus"},"2673":{"dur":1,"text":"being there all the time."},"2674":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have this idea of\nsubscribing to downtown Vegas."},"2677":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we have now is there's\na routine set of 20 or 30"},"2680":{"dur":3,"text":"people that we all see every\nmonth for about a

because I have things going\non, and they don't."},"2692":{"dur":1,"text":"They're there 100%."},"2694":{"dur":2,"text":"So back to our RRC calculation,\nif you break down"},"2697":{"dur":2,"text":"100 residents per acre, that\nactually, if you start"},"2700":{"dur":2,"text":"thinking about what I said about\nNatalie's calculation of"},"2702":{"dur":3,"text":"more about collisional hours\nthan dollars, and this is an"},"2706":{"dur":3,"text":"awkward slide, but essentially\ninstead of thinking about 100"},"2709":{"dur":2,"text":"people per acre, we think\nabout 100 collisional"},"2711":{"dur":1,"text":"community hours per\nacre per year--"},"2713":{"dur":1,"text":"100,000."},"2714":{"dur":2,"text":"And that really is actually\nwhat kind of happened to"},"2716":{"dur":4,"text":"Natalie, except she's on\nabout 1\/120 of an acre."},"2721":{"dur":4,"text":"And she's getting 100,000\ncollisions in a year for about"},"2726":{"dur":2,"text":"an hour at

of"},"2771":{"dur":1,"text":"the day, the question\nis, what will"},"2772":{"dur":0,"text":"people say about downtown?"},"2773":{"dur":3,"text":"And to us, we believe that the\nbig bet is that

that's step one."},"2952":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're slowly making progress\nin that area, but I"},"2955":{"dur":3,"text":"think, in Las Vegas, what the\ninstitutional folks

not to create\nsomething that's closed off"},"3029":{"dur":2,"text":"and to create something\nthat's accessible."},"3031":{"dur":3,"text":"So ultimately, we think that\nwhen it comes to housing,

about"},"3056":{"dur":1,"text":"getting more female\nentrepreneurs."},"3057":{"dur":4,"text":"And we said, we don't\nnecessarily have a an outward"},"3061":{"dur":2,"text":"focus on doing it, but we're\nnot closed off at all."},"3064":{"dur":1,"text":"We ultimately think that the\nmelting pot that is our"},"3066":{"dur":5,"text":"neighborhood can support that\ndiversity over

that's what makes\na magical."},"3085":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's the risk that we\nhave in investing is that"},"3087":{"dur":1,"text":"we'll end up shutting\nthat group
