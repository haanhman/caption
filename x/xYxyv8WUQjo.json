them."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"And if we take the difference\nbetween those measurements;"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"we can calculate the free board\nof the ice, so that's the

want"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"to present you our\nmost recent results,"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"and I don't really have time\nto go into what we've looked"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"in the past, and
