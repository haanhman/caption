Kenya."},"36":{"dur":1,"text":"We secured equipment,"},"37":{"dur":3,"text":"funds, vehicles, we trained a team,"},"41":{"dur":2,"text":"we set up a hundred clinics

power of mobile technology"},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"to deliver eye care in a new way?"},"89":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we developed Peek,"},"91":{"dur":2,"text":"a smartphone [system] that

Kenya,"},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"we went with 150,000 dollars of equipment,"},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"a team of 15 people,"},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"and that was what was\nneeded to deliver health care."},"209":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, all that's needed"},"212":{"dur":1,"text":"is a single person"},"214":{"dur":3,"text":"on a bike with a smartphone."},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"And it costs just 500

see all parts of the retina."},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"It makes it possible to pick up diseases"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"of the eye and of the body"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"that would not be possible without access to the eye,"},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"and that clip-on device can be manufactured"},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"for just a few dollars,"},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"and people can be cured of blindness,"},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think it says a lot about us as a human race"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"if we've developed cures and we don't deliver them."},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"But now we
