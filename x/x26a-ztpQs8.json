to get the\ndisclaimer right on the board"},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"right away, which is\nthat I do not know"},"100":{"dur":1,"text":"what the origin of life is."},"102":{"dur":2,"text":"I do not know what the\norigin of the universe is."},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"I do not know the\nmeaning of life."},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"What I do think is\nthat we have a way"},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"of talking

so\nmuch a set of answers"},"118":{"dur":2,"text":"to difficult questions\nas it is encouragement"},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"to continue the conversation\nwithin a particular framework."},"124":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'd like to start by telling\nyou the story of Lucia de Berk."},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"She was a Dutch nurse."},"129":{"dur":4,"text":"In 2004, she was convicted to\na sentence of life imprisonment"},"133":{"dur":3,"text":"for murdering several\ninfants under her care."},"137":{"dur":1,"text":"Now this is a sad story."},"138":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you look into it,\nthere is an interesting thing"},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"about the legal\nproceedings, which"},"143":{"dur":3,"text":"is there essentially wasn't\nany evidence she had done it."},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"And you might ask,\nhow is it possible"},"149":{"dur":4,"text":"that someone gets convicted of\nbasically being a mass murder"},"153":{"dur":1,"text":"without any direct evidence?"},"155":{"dur":1,"text":"There were no\neyewitnesses that saw"},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"her do anything, no\npoison in her handbag"},"159":{"dur":1,"text":"or anything like that."},"160":{"dur":2,"text":"And the answer is mathematics."},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"The prosecution\nasked statisticians"},"166":{"dur":4,"text":"to estimate the likelihood\nthat this number of children"},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"would die when a certain\nnurse was on duty."},"173":{"dur":1,"text":"And they said oh, it's\none in a million chance"},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"or hundreds of\nmillions of chance."},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"That was the primary reason\nwhy she was convicted."},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"Now later, other\nmathematicians looked at it"},"183":{"dur":3,"text":"and realize that it had\nbeen bad mathematics."},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"The argument was it was\nmore like a one in 25 or one"},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"in 100 chance that something\nlike that would happen,"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"which as I'm sure you all\nknow, those chances happen"},"194":{"dur":1,"text":"all the time."},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact someone pointed\nout that the total death"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"rate for children in\nthis hospital-- I mean,"},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"it's a pediatric care hospital,\nthere's sick children there--"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"the death rate went down\nafter she was hired,"},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"which is not the\neffect you would"},"208":{"dur":4,"text":"expect as the hiring of a\nserial killer to really have."},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"But the other question is,\nbesides the bad mathematics,"},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"why were the people on\nthe jury so easily swayed,"},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"even though there was no direct\nevidence that she had actually"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"done it?"},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'd like to point\nto the possibility"},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"that really it was part\nof our very human desire"},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"to blame something\nwhen something happens."},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"Rather than to think that\njust things happen and there's"},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"a little bit of irrationality\nand randomness in the world,"},"237":{"dur":4,"text":"we like to think there's a\nreason why things happen."},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"So when a whole bunch\nof children die,"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"more than we might expect,\nwe want someone to blame."},"247":{"dur":3,"text":"And once that starts,\nwe convince ourselves"},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"that we are on the\nright track, finding"},"252":{"dur":1,"text":"this reason for this happening."},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"The picture on the left is\nwhat Lucia de Berk actually"},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"looks like."},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"The picture on the right\nis the courtroom sketch"},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"of what she looks like."},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"Once you decide that this\nperson is the evil one who"},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"was responsible for this,\nthen you look at her"},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"in a slightly different way."},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"Fortunately the\nbad math went away."},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"The good math took over\nand she was released,"},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"she was exonerated, and\nfound innocent later on."},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"But the idea that we find\nreasons why things happen"},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"is not necessarily a bad one."},"283":{"dur":1,"text":"It's an ancient one\nand it goes back"},"284":{"dur":3,"text":"to some of the greatest\nthinkers in history."},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"Aristotle very\nfamously had what he"},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"called the four\ncauses for things"},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"happening, which we\nmight really think"},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"of as four kinds of\nexplanation why things occur."},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of them was the\nfinal cause for something."},"300":{"dur":4,"text":"The final cause for Aristotle is\nthe reason for which something"},"304":{"dur":4,"text":"exists, the goal for which it\nis created in the first place."},"308":{"dur":5,"text":"The final cause of a seed is to\ngrow into a tree, for example."},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"And this kind of reasoning,\nthis kind of metaphysical view"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"that the world at\nits deepest levels"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"is a story of\ncauses and effects,"},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"went through to these guys."},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"This is Spinoza and\nLeibniz, Baruch Spinoza"},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"and Gottfried Leibniz."},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"And they promulgated something\nwe call the principle"},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"of sufficient reason."},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"They also promulgated\na principle"},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"that philosophers' hair gets\nbetter and better over time,"},"336":{"dur":0,"text":"as you see."},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"I think Leibniz got\nartificial help."},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"But overall, there's\ncertainly a progress in nature"},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"that we can observe here."},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"The principal of\nsufficient reason"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"is simply the statement\nthat everything"},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"happens for a reason."},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"You can find this on bumper\nstickers and greeting cards,"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"but Leibniz in\nparticular raised it"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"to the level of a\nmetaphysical principle."},"357":{"dur":5,"text":"For everything that happens,\nthere is a cause or reason why."},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"And again it's not crazy."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"In our everyday experience,\nthat is kind of what we see."},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"Things do not just happen."},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"The book is not going to\nsee just fly off into air."},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"There seems to be reasons\nwhy things happen."},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"If the book moves, it's\nbecause I moved it."},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"And for Aristotle and\nfor many other people,"},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"this metaphysical claim\nthat things that happen"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"do so because something\ncauses them to happen,"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"influenced their\nideas about physics."},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"So for Aristotle, if\nthings are moving,"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"it implies that\nsomething is moving them."},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"There is a reason why\nthings are moving."},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"And his reasoning is\nquite straightforward."},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"If I start pushing on\nthe book, it will move."},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"And if I stop, it stops."},"403":{"dur":0,"text":"There you go."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"That's the basis for a way\nof thinking about physics,"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"that if you see things\nmoving in the world,"},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"you need to explain that."},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"You need to find the reason\nwhy, what the mover is."},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"And this extends from\nindividual objects like books"},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"to everything in the universe."},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"The universe is full of motions."},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"But to Aristotle, the\nnatural state of being"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"was for things to\nstay stationary."},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"So the existence of all these\nmotions and transformations"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"of all sorts\nimplies that there's"},"432":{"dur":5,"text":"something behind the scenes\ncausing those kinds of motions."},"437":{"dur":4,"text":"That is not how we think about\nfundamental physics today."},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"Over the course of improved\nexplanation and experimentation"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"and theorizing, we have a\nvery, very different way"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"of thinking about\nhow the world works"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"at its most fundamental level."},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's not a way that\nwe make a big deal of."},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"There's many things that\npopularization of science"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"will talk about\nover and over again."},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"You can't go faster\nthan the speed of light."},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"You can't know your position\nand velocity at the same time."},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"But we don't talk about the\nfact that the whole principle"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"of cause and effect as\na fundamental organizing"},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"principle for the universe\nis no longer part of our best"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"theories of physics."},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"Some people talked about it."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"Bertrand Russell\nliked to emphasize it."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"He was primarily a philosopher,\nbut a mathematical philosopher"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"who knew a lot of physics."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said, \"The law\nof causality I believe,"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"like much that passes\nmuster among philosophers,"},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"is a relic of a bygone age,\nsurviving, like the monarchy--\""},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"he just had to\nget that in there."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"He couldn't stick to just\nthe philosophy and science--"},"496":{"dur":4,"text":"\"only because it is erroneously\nsupposed to do no harm.\""},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"So this should be, I\nhope, in your minds,"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"quite an extraordinary claim."},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"The law of causality, that you\nhave a cause for every effect,"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"that the cause precedes\nthe effect, that's"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"not part of our understanding\nof the world anymore."},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"What is going on?"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"Well it's not that\nanything could happen."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not that because\nthere's no cause and effect"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"at the deep level, the\nbook can in fact just fly"},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"all over the place."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"The point is that we've\nreplaced the principal that"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"causes precede effects\nwith a principle"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"that the world is\ngoverned by patterns."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"And this happened slowly."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's one example, sort\nof the tipping point,"},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"if you will, from\none way of thinking"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"about the world to another\none, was the principal we"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"call conservation of momentum."},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"If any of you in the room\nhave taken physics classes,"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"you have been tortured by\nthe principle of conservation"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"of momentum to sort of\nfind the solution when"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"different balls bump into\neach other and so forth."},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"But in fact this\nprinciple is part"},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"of a whole new way\nof thinking about how"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"reality works at a deep level."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"It took hundreds of years\nand many, many smart people"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the primary\npeople was Ibn Sina,"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"who was a Persian polymath."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"To a modern physicist\nlike me, Ibn Sina"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"is extremely annoying, because\nhe wasn't even a physicist,"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"primarily."},"576":{"dur":0,"text":"He was a doctor."},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"He was a medical doctor."},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"He wrote a lot about the\nhuman body and anatomy."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"He did physics in\nhis spare time,"},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"and he invented\nconservation of momentum."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"This is very annoying to me."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"But he wouldn't have said\nconservation of momentum."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, it took hundreds\nof years to get it right."},"591":{"dur":4,"text":"The basic idea that Ibn\nSina put his finger on"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"is that if you could\nremove friction,"},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"if you could remove dissipation,\nif you imagine something"},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"moving through the vacuum,\nit would keep moving forever."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"This was the invention\nof that other device"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"that physics teachers like\nto use to torture people,"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"the frictionless surface."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"If you imagine something\nmoving in the complete absence"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"of friction, it\nwould not slow down"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"or require a cause\nto keep moving,"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"it would just keep moving."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"And this principle was improved\nupon by people like Galileo who"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"did experiments, and\nfinally Christiaan Huygens"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"was the one who\nactually formulated"},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"our modern mathematical notion\nof conservation of momentum."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"So why is conservation of\nmomentum such a big deal,"},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"over and above\nthe fact that it's"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"a tool for physicists to use?"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it implies that\nthere's a different way"},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"that the world naturally is."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're Aristotle, the\nnatural way for things to be"},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"is to kind of sit there\nin their happy place,"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"and you need to do something\nto get them moving."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"In a world with\nconservation of momentum,"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"the natural thing for the\nworld is to move and change,"},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"and implies you don't need to\nexplain why things are moving."},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"Things just naturally move."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"And this was developed over\ntime and probably reached"},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"the pinnacle with Pierre-Simon\nLaplace, a French mathematician"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"and physicist around\nthe year 1800."},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"He did not invent\nclassical mechanics."},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"It was Newton, as we all know,\nwho really put the finishing"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"touches on classical mechanics."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can make the\nargument that Laplace"},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"was the first person to really\ninternalize what it meant,"},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"the deep implications of this\nNewtonian clockwork universe"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"worldview."},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"So you know that if you\ndo a physics problem,"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"and again you ignore\nfriction and dissipation"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"and so forth, you play\nphysics billiards,"},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"physicist billiards where\nballs just bump into each other"},"698":{"dur":4,"text":"and so forth, you can solve\nthe problem of these two balls"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"are moving with\ncertain velocities."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"They scatter and they go\noff in another direction."},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"What is the direction\nand the speed"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"at which the balls\nare going to go?"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"Laplace was the\nfirst to point out"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"that that process is reversible."},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"That if you started\nup here saying"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"that the balls are\nmoving apart, what"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"were they doing in the past?"},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"And Newton's laws make an\nabsolutely clear prediction"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"for what they were\ndoing in this world"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"where you can ignore\nfriction and dissipation."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"If you made a movie\nof this whole process"},"731":{"dur":4,"text":"and played it backward, it\nwould look completely plausible."},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"So Laplace invented what we\nnow call Laplace's demon,"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"or what he called\na vast intellect."},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"Laplace's demon\nis something that"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"has the ability-- what\nwe'd now really call"},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"it is a really good computer."},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"Maybe you have a Laplace's demon\nin one of the other buildings."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"If Laplace's demon\nknew everything"},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"about the state of the\nuniverse at one moment in time,"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"the position and the momentum\nof every particle moving"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"in the universe,\nthen Laplace says"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"that vast intellect would\nknow the future and past just"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"as surely as the present."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"If that vast intellect knew\nall the laws of physics"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"and was able to calculate\nwhat would happen,"},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"there would be\nnothing that would"},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"be uncertain to that\nintellect about what"},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"would happen in the future,\nwhat had happened in the past."},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is, even though\nit's a subtle difference,"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"a crucially different way\nof thinking about the world."},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not that this configuration\nof stuff causes this one"},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"and therefore causes that."},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"All of them are\nrelated by a pattern"},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"called the laws of physics."},"794":{"dur":4,"text":"Just like the integers 0, 1, 2,\n3, minus 1, minus 2, minus 3,"},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"the number two happens\nafter the number one"},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"and before the\nnumber three, but we"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"don't say that the number one\nis the cause of number two,"},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"or two is the cause of three."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"We just say that every\nnumber is one bigger or less"},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"than the numbers next to it."},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just a pattern\nthat follows,"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can go forward\nor backward equally well."},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"And Laplace says that\nis what the world is"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"like at a deep level."},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"Now these things we know better\nthan Newtonian mechanics."},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"We've had quantum mechanics,\nstatistical mechanics,"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"general relativity,\nand so forth."},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"But the basic Laplacian\nprinciple remains the same."},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just the actual laws\nthat we have are different."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"So one of the claims\nthat I make in the book"},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"that I would like

known."},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"Now when I say this,\npeople like to stop"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"listening when I say\nunderlying everyday life, so I"},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"want to emphasize that."},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not saying the laws of\nphysics are completely known."},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not also saying\nthat everyday life"},"857":{"dur":0,"text":"is completely
