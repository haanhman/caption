the\nspecifics of what we've"},"64":{"dur":2,"text":"done there and some of the\nprojects we've contributed to,"},"67":{"dur":1,"text":"I wanted to talk just\na little bit in general"},"69":{"dur":1,"text":"about how Google\nuses open source"},"71":{"dur":4,"text":"and how we're effectively\nbuilt on top of open source."},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"It would be

it."},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"If I were to contrast that\nwith sort of the closed source"},"196":{"dur":6,"text":"world and binary packages, you\ncan still create a painting,"},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"but maybe your options are\na little bit more limited."},"205":{"dur":6,"text":"So maybe the paint-by-numbers is\na good way to think about

jobs."},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"But not only do we run Linux on\nour laptops and workstations,"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"but we also run it\nin our data centers."},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"So every service that\nyou use at Google"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"is powered underneath\nthat by Linux."},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"Another way that\nwe use open source"},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"is our development

job"},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"done on a day-to-day basis,\nwe're working on source code"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"or making modifications to that."},"315":{"dur":4,"text":"We use open source integrated\ndevelopment environments, IDEs."},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"We use open source text editors\nfor modifying source code."},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"We use open source\nversion

that we use to compile\nthe software, all of that"},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"is open source as well."},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"But open source has\na lot of its roots,"},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"and the ability to be able to\ndevelop open source software"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"is based on open standards."},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"So these are standard\norganizations"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"that have gotten\ntogether and defined"},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"in the open how certain\nthings should work,"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"the characteristics of it."},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"And then a lot of times\nthey'll create reference"},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"implementations based\non those standards."},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you think about\nthe presentation"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're watching today,\nwhether you're here locally"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"or you're watching it\nremote over YouTube,"},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"there are a lot of\nstandards that are

saw\nJoe, the previous session, Joe"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"Beda mentioned that we\ncontributed cgroups,"},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that was back\nin 2007 and 2008,"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's sort of the\nunderlying technology"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"behind containers and\nsome of the technology"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"that you see out there in the\nopen source world like

those are great examples\nof Google contributed back"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"to existing projects."},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"Some of you are probably\nalready also aware"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"that Google does initiate a\nlot of open source projects."},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"So to name a few, obviously\nAndroid, everybody I'm sure"},"568":{"dur":0,"text":"has heard of

possible."},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"So all of these are developed,\nwere initiated by Google"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"open source from the beginning."},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"They all have very\nactive contributions,"},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"not only from Googlers, but\nalso from other external"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"corporations and even\nexternal developers that"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"are interested in the technology\nand want to participate in it."},"611":{"dur":4,"text":"So let's talk a little bit\nabout Compute Engine also."},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"Lots of announcements\ntoday with Compute"},"617":{"dur":6,"text":"Engine, and as we mentioned,\nbecause it's a Google service,"},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"it runs on top of\nopen source software."},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"So some of the open\nsource software"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"that we use to power\nCompute Engine,"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"obviously it runs on\ntop of Linux servers"},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"in our data centers, and we\nuse KVM as our virtualization"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"layer."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"We provide a public\nAPI, and that's"},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"defined by open standards,\nit's an HTTP REST API."},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's nothing\nsort of unique"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"about that, there's\nnothing proprietary,"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"it's completely open\nbased off of standards."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"Even the images\nthat you can launch,"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"the virtual machines\nthat you can spin up,"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"the operating systems\nthat we supply by default,"},"662":{"dur":8,"text":"are Debian, CentOS, Red Hat\nyou saw, [?

again, open source\ntechnology through and through."},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"Now we're kind of ready to\nget into some of the work"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"that we've done for open\nsource projects that"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"are out there that do\nsupport Compute Engine."},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"Kind of the best way I think\nto probably start this off"},"694":{"dur":4,"text":"is just sort of let's use the\nHello World of Compute Engine."},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"So, what I have up here is\n13 lines of Python code,"},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"and what this will do is\ncreate a single virtual machine"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"in Compute Engine."},"710":{"dur":5,"text":"And this uses the open\nsource Python library."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"It's an Apache Software\nFoundation Project"},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"called Libcloud."},"719":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a multi-cloud\nlibrary written in Python."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can use this with\nother cloud providers as well."},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"So recognizing that there\nmight be users out there that"},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"would be using another\nprovider that maybe would also"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"want to try Compute\nEngine, we went through"},"735":{"dur":4,"text":"and we contributed code and\ndocumentation, sample scripts,"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"on how you, if you're\nalready using Libcloud"},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"or an application\nmaybe that's even"},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"built on top of the Libcloud,\ncan go in and basically make"},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"some minor configuration\nchanges for authentication,"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"and, by and large, it\nshould probably just work."},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"You may have to make\nsome customizations there"},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"in terms of the machine\nsize or the location,"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"but otherwise it's\nthe same concepts"},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"that you would\nget using Libcloud"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"with any other provider."},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"But maybe Python's\nnot your thing."},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe you're a Ruby developer."},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"Well fortunately, there is\nanother library out there"},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"that's very similar to\nLibcloud in that it works"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"with multiple\nproviders, and here I've"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"got a snippet of Ruby code,\nwhich does effectively"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, the code\nalmost looks identical."},"790":{"dur":5,"text":"This fog is an open source\nlibrary all in Ruby,"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"and again, you can use that\nwith multiple cloud providers"},"798":{"dur":0,"text":"as well."},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is another example of\nwhere Google contributed code"},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"back over to the fog\nopen source community"},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"to make sure that any fog\ndevelopers or applications that"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"are built using fog can now\nalso use Compute Engine."},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's this other\nlanguage out there"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"called Java that's\nproved very popular,"},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"and there happens to be another\nopen source project very"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"similar to both\nLibcloud and fog that"},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"allows you to work with\nmultiple cloud providers."},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"And so here I've got\nto 12 lines of code."},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"This one's a little bit\ndifferent in the sense"},"833":{"dur":7,"text":"that this code snippet here, and\nthis is a jclouds sort of idiom"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"that they have templates\nthat you define,"},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"where you set the node\nattributes or the instance"},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"attributes that\nyou want to create."},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"And so here I'm just\nassuming that I'm"},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"using the default in that\nthose are same values,"},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"it's probably a single\ncore machine type,"},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"and hopefully it's in a region\nthat's going to be close by."},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"But these are all attributes\nthat I could modify and change,"},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"and then I can specify\nmy exact environment"},"864":{"dur":1,"text":"that I want with jclouds."},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"So again, as I'd\nmentioned, Google"},"870":{"dur":4,"text":"had contributed to code with the\nexception I think of jclouds."},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"We've kind of poked\nat it a little bit"},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"and offered some\nhelp here and there,"},"878":{"dur":2,"text":"but by and large, this was\ndone by the community itself."},"884":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I just showed you that you\ncan use-- programmatically,"},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"you can create your own virtual\nmachines and spin those up."},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's great, but now\nyou want to put them to work."},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"So the next thing\nthat you would do,"},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"once you have your\ninstance up and running,"},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"is you probably want to go ahead\nand put your own software on it"},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"or run a service on it."},"904":{"dur":1,"text":"And the way that\nyou would normally"},"906":{"dur":1,"text":"do that, I guess just\nsort of out of the box,"},"908":{"dur":1,"text":"you'd probably SSH into that."},"909":{"dur":3,"text":"And since they're all open\nsource Linux distributions,"},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"you'd use your package managers\nto pull down your packages,"},"915":{"dur":1,"text":"to pull you application\nand get it configured."},"920":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think also you saw\nin the previous talk,"},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"if you saw that one, we talked\na little bit about snowflakes."},"925":{"dur":2,"text":"So you're going to\nspend a lot of time"},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"tuning and tweaking this\nand getting it just right."},"931":{"dur":2,"text":"But then the next time\nthat you want to go and do"},"933":{"dur":1,"text":"that, you have to\nkind of remember, oh,"},"935":{"dur":1,"text":"what were all those\npackages I had to go?"},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"Or how did I get around that\none particular dependency?"},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"Oh yeah, that's right, I had to\ncompile that thing from source."},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's a lot of things\nthat you want to make and turn"},"945":{"dur":3,"text":"into sort of a\nrepeatable process."},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"There are a lot of open source\nconfiguration management tools"},"952":{"dur":4,"text":"out there that you can\nuse, and all of these now,"},"956":{"dur":4,"text":"through code contributions by\nGoogle, support Compute Engine."},"961":{"dur":1,"text":"So the two biggest\nones that you probably"},"963":{"dur":2,"text":"have heard of, Puppet\nand Chef, but then"},"965":{"dur":1,"text":"there's also newer ones\nthat are coming out,"},"967":{"dur":2,"text":"SaltStack and Ansible."},"969":{"dur":4,"text":"And again, all of these\nsupport Compute Engine."},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"So tying back into the\nprevious conversation"},"978":{"dur":5,"text":"about getting away from\nsnowflakes, all of these tools"},"983":{"dur":3,"text":"allow you to create a\nconfiguration that represents"},"987":{"dur":4,"text":"the desired state of\nyour server or servers,"},"991":{"dur":2,"text":"your virtual machines\nin the cloud."},"994":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like a declarative syntax."},"996":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn't tell\nreally how a machine"},"998":{"dur":1,"text":"should get itself

capture in a\nconfiguration file."},"1013":{"dur":2,"text":"Those configuration\nfiles can be versioned,"},"1015":{"dur":1,"text":"so you can track\nchanges to that stuff,"},"1017":{"dur":4,"text":"if you make a mistake\nyou can roll it back."},"1021":{"dur":2,"text":"They all strive\nto be idempotent,"},"1024":{"dur":2,"text":"so you can rerun the same\ncommand over and over again"},"1027":{"dur":2,"text":"and tune and tweak it\nand run the same command,"},"1029":{"dur":3,"text":"and it will only install\nthings that have changed."},"1033":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a great

here's some of\nthe other popular ones"},"1050":{"dur":1,"text":"that we've come across."},"1052":{"dur":3,"text":"In some cases, Google\nhas contributed either"},"1055":{"dur":4,"text":"directly to the project,\nor through code, or just"},"1059":{"dur":0,"text":"through documentation."},"1060":{"dur":2,"text":"Like Docker, I think for\ninstance, one of our developer"},"1063":{"dur":3,"text":"advocates put together a nice\nclean set of instructions,"},"1067":{"dur":3,"text":"it's like 10 lines of code to\nget up and running with that."},"1070":{"dur":3,"text":"CoreOS has an image that you\ncan put into your project,"},"1073":{"dur":4,"text":"and you can run the CoreOS image\nright inside of Compute

with\nCompute Engine."},"1086":{"dur":2,"text":"And Packer is\nanother project that"},"1088":{"dur":2,"text":"allows you to sort of\nbundle up your image"},"1091":{"dur":3,"text":"and get it customized the way\nyou want and then reuse that."},"1096":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's flip over to a demo."},"1099":{"dur":4,"text":"So we should have a terminal\ncome up here in a second."},"1104":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me just cat out this file."},"1110":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is very similar\nto the little Hello World"},"1114":{"dur":2,"text":"example in Python that\nI showed you before."},"1117":{"dur":2,"text":"The only couple differences\nhere to call out,"},"1119":{"dur":3,"text":"obviously lines five, six, and\nseven have my

you."},"1148":{"dur":2,"text":"And let's see, what else."},"1151":{"dur":3,"text":"Oh-- I've got it hard\ncoded in there on line 14"},"1154":{"dur":3,"text":"that we want to create\n100 virtual machines."},"1158":{"dur":2,"text":"And then on line\n16, what we'll do"},"1160":{"dur":2,"text":"is we'll print out--\nthat will return"},"1163":{"dur":2,"text":"an array of created\nvirtual machines."},"1166":{"dur":1,"text":"And then so on\nline 16, I'm going"},"1167":{"dur":2,"text":"to print out sort of\nthe length of that list,"},"1170":{"dur":2,"text":"and hopefully that\ncomes out to be 100."},"1172":{"dur":1,"text":"And then how long did that take."},"1177":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's just go\nahead and run this."},"1180":{"dur":6,"text":"So let's call this Hello\nWorld Times 100, I guess."},"1186":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I'll flip over to the\ndeveloper console here,"},"1189":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can see this is the\ndemo virtual machine that I"},"1192":{"dur":3,"text":"was on when I executed\nthat command just now."},"1195":{"dur":3,"text":"So we should start to see\na couple instances spin up."},"1208":{"dur":4,"text":"OK, so flipping over\nto the Disks tab,"},"1212":{"dur":3,"text":"our virtual machines now\nuse persistent disks."},"1216":{"dur":2,"text":"That's your only\noption right now."},"1218":{"dur":2,"text":"There is no ephemeral\ndisk or scratch disk."},"1221":{"dur":3,"text":"So what this has done\nis it's created the 100"},"1224":{"dur":2,"text":"persistent disks."},"1226":{"dur":1,"text":"Each is 10 gigs\nin size, and each"},"1228":{"dur":4,"text":"has the Debian image\nloaded on them."},"1233":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we also have\nthe 100 instances"},"1237":{"dur":1,"text":"that are being created."},"1238":{"dur":3,"text":"And so each of those\ninstances is matched."},"1242":{"dur":3,"text":"I should have pointed this\nout in the sample code,"},"1245":{"dur":3,"text":"but I give it a name\nprefix of LC for Libcloud,"},"1248":{"dur":2,"text":"and then it just depends\non an auto incrementing"},"1251":{"dur":2,"text":"integer for each\ninstance it creates."},"1253":{"dur":3,"text":"And then that also matches the\nname of the persistent disk,"},"1256":{"dur":3,"text":"and so then that's what\nit uses as its boot disk."},"1260":{"dur":3,"text":"One thing I'd like to point\nout as you're getting up"},"1263":{"dur":3,"text":"to speed with Compute Engine\nand you want to learn our API,"},"1267":{"dur":0,"text":"there's a couple things."},"1268":{"dur":1,"text":"So what I did here\nis I drilled down"},"1269":{"dur":4,"text":"into just one of these\ninstances, in this case LC001,"},"1274":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'm scrolling\ndown, and I'm looking"},"1276":{"dur":2,"text":"at some of the attributes on it."},"1278":{"dur":2,"text":"But down here at\nthe bottom, we have"},"1281":{"dur":2,"text":"a couple hyperlinks\nthat you can click on,"},"1284":{"dur":2,"text":"and this will show\nyou the exact REST"},"1286":{"dur":5,"text":"API that defines this instance."},"1292":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's a great\nway to learn the API."},"1294":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there's\nalso Compute Engine"},"1296":{"dur":2,"text":"provides a command line\nutility called gcutil, which"},"1299":{"dur":4,"text":"is part of G Cloud, and this\ngives you the exact SSH command"},"1303":{"dur":3,"text":"that you can just cut and paste\nSSH directly into that machine."},"1307":{"dur":2,"text":"So I wanted to call that out\nbecause that's a great way"},"1309":{"dur":3,"text":"to get up and running\nwith Compute Engine."},"1316":{"dur":2,"text":"Just kind of quickly drilling\nthrough some of this stuff."},"1319":{"dur":3,"text":"Snapshots, from a\npersistent disk,"},"1322":{"dur":1,"text":"you can create a\nsnapshot off of that."},"1324":{"dur":2,"text":"And snapshots are\nstored globally,"},"1326":{"dur":3,"text":"so this is a great way for\nyou to replicate data around."},"1330":{"dur":3,"text":"You can create your instance,\ncustomize it the way you want,"},"1333":{"dur":2,"text":"and then take a snapshot\nof that persistent disk,"},"1335":{"dur":3,"text":"and then bring up another\npersistent disk, let's"},"1339":{"dur":2,"text":"say in Europe, and an\ninstance based off of that,"},"1342":{"dur":4,"text":"and you've just replicated\nyour instance over there."},"1346":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's go back to\nthe instance list."},"1349":{"dur":1,"text":"And if we scroll\nall the way down,"},"1351":{"dur":3,"text":"hopefully we'll see down\nto 99, so let's find out"},"1355":{"dur":6,"text":"how long did it take us to\ncreate 100 virtual machines."},"1361":{"dur":4,"text":"So 100 in 1 minute\nand 27 seconds."},"1366":{"dur":4,"text":"And these, again, they're\nall Debian images."},"1370":{"dur":1,"text":"You can SSH into\nany one of these,"},"1372":{"dur":5,"text":"and we had 100% success\nin less than two minutes."},"1378":{"dur":4,"text":"So if we can flip back\nto the slides, please."},"1382":{"dur":1,"text":"So what's next?"},"1383":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's a lot of things\nthat came out today."},"1387":{"dur":3,"text":"So as we've been working\nto contribute code"},"1390":{"dur":1,"text":"back to the open\nsource community"},"1392":{"dur":2,"text":"for supporting\nCompute Engine, we're"},"1395":{"dur":1,"text":"always iterating on
