make Redhook Ale."},"509":{"dur":5,"text":"I guess he agreed with\nthe local publican"},"514":{"dur":5,"text":"to launch the Redhook\nAle on a certain date."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"And the date came\nfor the launch,"},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"and they realized that the beer\ndidn't really taste very good."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"But they were kind of stuck,\nbecause they had put out"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"in the press that they were\ngoing to open on this date."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"So they had their grand\nopening with the mayor"},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"and all

they knew this stuff\ndoesn't taste good."},"551":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was actually left to\na reporter for the Seattle"},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"newspaper to say what\neveryone was thinking, which"},"559":{"dur":5,"text":"is, this beer tastes\nlike rotten bananas."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"He called it banana beer."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"But they kind of soldiered on."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"This was all new\nterritory, and who"},"571":{"dur":6,"text":"knew what craft beer was\nsupposed to taste like."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"So they soldiered on with\nthis bad tasting banana"},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"beer for about a year,\nand people bought it"},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"because they wanted to give\na local brewer a chance."},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"They were thrilled\nthat there was"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"going to be a new\nbrewery in Seattle."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"People bought the beer,\nbut after about a year,"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"word

Miller,"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"because they couldn't\nget much beyond the pint."},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"And then a guy\ncame to Seattle who"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"is very important for the\ncraft

the beer, so his\nlife ended rather early."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"But Michael visited\nall those breweries."},"658":{"dur":4,"text":"So he came to Redhook, and\nhe tasted the Redhook

about it."},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"So he tasted it,\nand he said, well"},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"this is kind of\nlike a Belgian beer."},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"And Shipman said,\nexactly, Michael!"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a Belgian style beer."},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"And he set about-- he changed\nall the copy on the label"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"to say it's a\nBelgian style beer,"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"and they changed all\ntheir marketing materials."},"691":{"dur":5,"text":"And they forged ahead,\nbut still, no matter what"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"you called it, it\ndidn't taste good."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"And then this guy,\nanother guy who's"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"really important for the\nhistory of craft beer,"},"706":{"dur":5,"text":"came to Seattle, a brewing\nchemist named Joe Owades."},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"Dr. Joe Owades."},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"And Joe had been the technical\ndirector at the Rheingold"},"717":{"dur":4,"text":"Brewery in Brooklyn, and\nhe developed light beer."},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"He developed the first ever\nlow calorie beer in the '60s."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"Unfortunately, the\nmarketing department"},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"decided to call it Gablinger's,\nand it totally flopped."},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"No one really understood\nwhat it was all about."},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"And it really wasn't\nuntil Miller Lite years"},"740":{"dur":5,"text":"later popularized light\nbeer with those less filling"},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"more flavor commercials,\nwhich actually many"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"of your generation\nmay not remember."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"Anyway, it was a while\nbefore light beer took off."},"755":{"dur":5,"text":"And Joe actually advised\nmany other craft brewers,"},"761":{"dur":5,"text":"but when he came to Seattle--\nJoe's a very blunt guy."},"767":{"dur":4,"text":"German, and very\nsure of himself."},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"So Joe tasted the Redhook\nale, and he turned to Shipman"},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"and said, is this made for\nsome sort of ethnic group"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"here in Seattle."},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"And Shipman said, no, Joe."},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"It's our Belgian style ale."},"789":{"dur":5,"text":"And Owades looked at him\nand said, no, it's not."},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"It's infected."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"He said, this beer\nhas a bacteria in it."},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"So Joe gave them a\nnumber of a yeast"},"803":{"dur":5,"text":"to buy from the Siebel Institute\nin Chicago, which Shipman did."},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"And then they produced a new\nbeer called Ballard Bitter,"},"812":{"dur":6,"text":"and Redhook was on\ntheir way to success."},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"I love that story\nbecause I think it really"},"820":{"dur":6,"text":"illustrates how clueless\nthe small brewers were back"},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"in the day."},"829":{"dur":6,"text":"Joe Owades went on to create\na beer in New York City"},"835":{"dur":4,"text":"called New Amsterdam Amber\nfor one of the pioneers name"},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"Matthew Reich, who was\nthe first contract brewer."},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"Matthew

York"},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"City, and he did that on\n11th Avenue and 26th Street."},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you know anything\nabout New York City,"},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"particularly back\nin the mid '80s,"},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"that neighborhood was\nbetter known for hookers"},"863":{"dur":4,"text":"than for a brewery with\na 300 seat restaurant."},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"And he was out of\nbusiness within a year"},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"after building that brewery."},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"But I learned a\nlot from watching"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"what happened to\nMatthew building"},"878":{"dur":3,"text":"the brewery prematurely\nin a bad spot."},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"And so did Jim Cook\nfrom Sam Adams."},"884":{"dur":5,"text":"Jim went to school\non Matthew, as did I."},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"And actually Jim\nended up hiring Owades"},"893":{"dur":4,"text":"to develop the recipe for\nSam Adams Boston Lager."},"898":{"dur":6,"text":"And he also ended up\nhiring Matthew's brewmaster"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"and assistant brewmaster,\nand the brewmaster"},"906":{"dur":4,"text":"is still with Sam\nAdams to this day."},"910":{"dur":4,"text":"And the point I'm making\nis that Jim and Brooklyn"},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"Brewery and a lot\nof other breweries"},"918":{"dur":3,"text":"started up after the\nperiod of the pioneers,"},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"and we learned\nfrom the pioneers."},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"That was critical\nto our developing"},"927":{"dur":3,"text":"our businesses and the\nbeers we were selling"},"931":{"dur":2,"text":"and how we priced those beers."},"934":{"dur":4,"text":"We learned so much, the\nsame way the later pioneers"},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"learned from Fritz\nand New Albion."},"945":{"dur":3,"text":"Things developed pretty\nquickly in the '80s."},"948":{"dur":5,"text":"There were about 1,000\nbreweries by 1994."},"954":{"dur":5,"text":"I call my generation of brewers\nthe first generation as opposed"},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"to the pioneers."},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of people look\nat the '90s and believe"},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"there was a period where\ncraft beer kind of crashed,"},"968":{"dur":3,"text":"because there were a couple\nof spectacular failures."},"971":{"dur":2,"text":"Pete's Wicked Ale, which\nactually started right here"},"974":{"dur":5,"text":"in Palo Alto, went up\nquickly to 400,000 barrels"},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"and down almost as\nquickly when they"},"982":{"dur":6,"text":"sold to Gambrinas Company,\nthe importer of Corona beer."},"988":{"dur":4,"text":"And Catamount, in Vermont, one\nof the pioneering breweries,"},"992":{"dur":3,"text":"built a second brewery\nbut then stopped growing."},"995":{"dur":3,"text":"So one thing you\nlearn in manufacturing"},"998":{"dur":4,"text":"is if you build a brewery,\nyou must pay for that brewery."},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you don't produce\nbeer in that brewery,"},"1005":{"dur":2,"text":"you're probably not going to\nbe able to pay for the brewery."},"1008":{"dur":2,"text":"And I've seen that\nhappen numerous times"},"1010":{"dur":1,"text":"to different people."},"1012":{"dur":1,"text":"But in writing the book,\none thing I realized"},"1014":{"dur":3,"text":"is that, far from a\nslump in the '90s,"},"1018":{"dur":2,"text":"there were actually about\n500 breweries started up"},"1020":{"dur":5,"text":"between '94 and 2000, including\nsome incredibly innovative"},"1026":{"dur":5,"text":"breweries, like Dogfish\nin Delaware, Allagash,"},"1031":{"dur":3,"text":"up in Maine, Russian\nRiver, here in California,"},"1035":{"dur":3,"text":"New Belgium in Colorado."},"1038":{"dur":2,"text":"And the difference\nbetween those
