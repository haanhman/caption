{"0":{"dur":6,"text":"One of the strangest things about relationships is that we're not free to feel attracted to just anyone."},"6":{"dur":4,"text":"We tend to have very strong psychological types that we can't deviate from."},"11":{"dur":8,"text":"All of us carry inside us very specific inner shopping lists, defining what the people we can love need to be like as characters."},"19":{"dur":3,"text":"You might think these shopping lists would be focused around lovely requirements."},"23":{"dur":6,"text":"Like that our potential lovers would need to be kind, understanding, friendly and from our age and social group."},"29":{"dur":4,"text":"But the shopping lists are in fact often a lot wierder and darker."},"34":{"dur":7,"text":"We may end up neglecting all sorts of potential candidates, dismissing them as boring or yucky or somehow just wrong"},"41":{"dur":5,"text":"and heading straight to people whose characteristics are pretty akward and not conducive to our happiness."},"47":{"dur":6,"text":"For example, we may only be able to fall in love with people who are much less clever or responsible than we are."},"53":{"dur":5,"text":"Or who are really unreliable, who are selfish and self-absorbed, or sarcastic and mean."},"59":{"dur":3,"text":"It can be very puzzling to those around us and to ourselves."},"62":{"dur":3,"text":"Why on earth can't we settle down with people who are good for us?"},"66":{"dur":5,"text":"That's because what we're looking for in love isn't necessarily someone who is nice, pure and simple"},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"but someone who feels familiar."},"74":{"dur":7,"text":"And a lot of us learned about love in childhood, at the hands of people who were, in a variety of ways, trouble for us"},"82":{"dur":3,"text":"and who continue unconsciously to guide our love types."},"86":{"dur":5,"text":"Our earliest caregivers give us templates of what it is to love and be loved"},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"which can cause havoc with our chances of happiness."},"94":{"dur":4,"text":"The trickiness in our love types tend to go in one of three ways."},"98":{"dur":6,"text":"Let's imagine dad was cold or violent or abusive, or mom was belittling, unavailable or controlling."},"105":{"dur":4,"text":"It was horrible, yet that ends up being what we look for in love."},"109":{"dur":3,"text":"Why would we ever repeat something that was deeply uncomfortable?"},"112":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, because even though it was horrible, it was still a love relationship."},"116":{"dur":7,"text":"There was abuse but also, let's imagine, a degree of familiarity, admiration, attachment and even tenderness."},"124":{"dur":3,"text":"They may have been belittling, but it's what we got used to."},"127":{"dur":5,"text":"And now, however illogical it sounds, it doesn't quite feel right unless it's kind of awful as well."},"133":{"dur":5,"text":"It's not nice as such, but it feels comfortingly, compellingly familiar."},"139":{"dur":6,"text":"Or, imagine the experience firsthand... what it was like to be made to feel terrible, to be humiliated and hurt."},"146":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, wierdly, we may end up doing the same thing to someone else."},"150":{"dur":6,"text":"Humiliating them in turn, bossing them about, going cold on them just when they're vulnerable to us."},"156":{"dur":6,"text":"It's as if a primitive part of us thinks that the only way not to be abused is to be the abuser."},"162":{"dur":7,"text":"Deep inside the child-like emotional self thinks the person who did that thing to me was, in a way, the opposite of me,"},"170":{"dur":7,"text":"and that must be the place of safety, and that's who I want to be in any relationship."},"177":{"dur":7,"text":"When parents cause us trouble, we're often so keen to get away from it, we develop blocks around all kind of character traits they may have had"},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"which might actually have been good and actually unrelated to the troublesome traits."},"189":{"dur":4,"text":"So, for example, our father might have been belittling but highly intelligent."},"193":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, regrettably, anyone intelligent can be seen hugely putting us off."},"197":{"dur":6,"text":"Or we always felt our mother was somehow revolted by sexuality, ours especially, but she was really warm and cuddly."},"204":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, sadly, anyone who is warm and cuddly is imagined to be punitive around sex"},"209":{"dur":2,"text":"and hence feels wrong and has to be rejected."},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"Our inner love maps are really hard to tease out."},"215":{"dur":5,"text":"They certainly don't spell themselves out, so we have to make efforts to find out what they're dictating"},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"so as to free ourselves from their demands."},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"The investigation starts, as always, by trying to understand ourselves."},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"What did I suffer from at the hands of my early caregivers?"},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"Am I finding myself drawn to that in adults I fancy?"},"234":{"dur":4,"text":"Am I causing trouble for people in ways I might have suffered from when I was young?"},"239":{"dur":6,"text":"Am I putting off certain people because they have traits I associate with people who cause me difficulties as a child?"},"245":{"dur":5,"text":"Might I in other people find the traits I like without the ones I fear?"},"251":{"dur":5,"text":"Emotional health means expanding on the number of people we're free to fall in love with."},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"We learn about love in childhood,"},"258":{"dur":5,"text":"but we liberate ourselves from the traumas of childhood when we realize we can love in different ways,"},"263":{"dur":5,"text":"and get used to something that may at first be eerily and challengingly unfamiliar."},"269":{"dur":5,"text":"Being happy with someone who is properly and deeply good for us."}}
