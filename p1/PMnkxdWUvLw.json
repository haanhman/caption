think?"},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"So, that interest I had in\nneuroscience was carried over"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"because I realized I was less\ninterested in cutting up brains

people were doing musical puppets,\nand could you do Stereovision"},"307":{"dur":5,"text":"with cheap web cameras, and they were\njust doing really interesting things."},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, it was a terrific decision."},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"I will say it was a little bit scary,\nbecause at the same time,"},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"people are like what is Symbolic Systems."},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"I have to tell everyone what a Symbolic\nSystems is, why does it make sense?"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"My father really wanted to know,\npaying the bills for Stanford,"},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"like, what is Symbolic Systems,\nand what will you use it for?"},"328":{"dur":4,"text":"But, it was an amazing major that really\nlet me experience the range of

1999."},"366":{"dur":4,"text":"It's funny, because I actually spent\nthe 97, 98 school year living in Schwab."},"370":{"dur":2,"text":">> [LAUGH]\n>> And I wasn't a business school student,"},"373":{"dur":4,"text":"but they had about 20 other students\nwho lived in the dorms for balance, so"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"I was one of the balance people in

was kind of the process and"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"it was just that time."},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"The Internet was very heady and so\nit was very easy to pick up offers."},"411":{"dur":4,"text":"In the end I picked up about 14 offers and\nI had to sort of sort and"},"416":{"dur":4,"text":"shift through them all,\nshift and sort through them all."},"420":{"dur":6,"text":"And, there were a lot of different\nthings that weighed on me at the time."},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"And, it was easy for me to pick\nthe best offer of each type, right?"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"I knew if I was going to do consulting,\nI was most interested in Mackenzie."},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"If I was going to do a big company,\nI was most interested in Oracle."},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"I've done a lot of lecturing here at\nStanford and I had an offer to go to"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"Carnegie Mellon and\nlecture in their Computer Science program."},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, if I did that I would go there."},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"If I did a startup,\nit was probably going to be Google."},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"But I found it very difficult to integrate\nacross the different disciplines because"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"the job offers were so different."},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I went and I thought a lot about it,"},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"I procrastinated a lot and I told myself\nI had to make a decision on May 1st."},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"And, I have a friend who now\nworks at Yahoo with me but"},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"was a friend of mine from undergrad and\ndid a

and"},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"I said okay, I just need somebody who\ncan help me really synthesize across all"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"these different types of jobs and\nanalyze it."},"489":{"dur":6,"text":"And so we sat down and\nwe had this big matrix where we had."},"495":{"dur":5,"text":"Location, salary, job trajectory,\nhappiness factor and"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"like I then remember there are even\nthings where we were like look,"},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"we can't get these with the street values,\nwe need curves so we were like

very emotional."},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"And I just didn't really notice because\nhe was deeply involved in graphing."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":">> [LAUGH]\n>> And also it turned to me, and"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"he was like, what are you so upset about?"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was like I just don't know."},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"I told myself I'd make\na job sitting

at these and"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"you're looking for the right choice."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"That's interesting that you said\nin your question the right choice."},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"And he's like you're sitting here and\nyou're looking for the right choice and"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"he's like, you think there's one\nright choice and 13 wrong choices,"},"583":{"dur":4,"text":"I guess I understand as well as you do and\nthat's just not what I see here at all."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"He's like I see 14 very good choices and\nthen there's the one"},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"that you're going to pick and commit to\nand may create and feel good about and"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"he's like and it's not going to be\na matter of right versus wrong."},"599":{"dur":0,"text":"It's just like it's all good."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there's the one that's great and\nyou commit to."},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"And people have asked me what's the best\npiece of advice I've ever gotten?"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's easily,\nit was that moment from Andre."},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"And that, because he's like,"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"look, a lot of times, smart people when\nthey get really committed to a problem,"},"613":{"dur":4,"text":"start to analyze it as if there's only one\ngreat option and all the others are not."},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's just not how life works and\nit's important to realize when you get"},"621":{"dur":4,"text":"really overwhelmed in those kinds\nof choices to think about it."},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"To really think about it

four years."},"1320":{"dur":3,"text":"And now it looks easy, and\nlooks like it was the right bet."},"1324":{"dur":1,"text":"And the strategy looks like it worked."},"1326":{"dur":2,"text":"But at the

there."},"1341":{"dur":1,"text":"Issues in revenue remained flat,"},"1342":{"dur":3,"text":"because we also had this decline that\nwe were trying to fill in the gap."},"1346":{"dur":2,"text":"So even all that growth\njust basically offset"},"1350":{"dur":2,"text":"the revenue that was otherwise\nleaving the company."},"1353":{"dur":2,"text":"But we did small acquisitions for

to"},"1758":{"dur":3,"text":"make sure that I can also be the best\nmother that I can be, right."},"1762":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what we basically came\nup with is I was out

work."},"1831":{"dur":6,"text":"I happened to be at work with my son\nthere, but it ultimately worked."},"1838":{"dur":2,"text":"It gave me the time that\nI needed to be CEO,"},"1840":{"dur":3,"text":"and also the time that I needed with him."},"1844":{"dur":4,"text":"And then when we went to revise\nour family leave policies,"},"1848":{"dur":3,"text":"because Yahoo

leave."},"1879":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what we do now is any parent,"},"1882":{"dur":5,"text":"any new parent gets eight weeks in\nthe first year of the child's life."},"1888":{"dur":2,"text":"And biological mothers can\nget up to 16 weeks, so"},"1890":{"dur":4,"text":"basically four months of time off."},"1894":{"dur":3,"text":"But that was something that\nwas overall important to me."},"1898":{"dur":4,"text":"Because that time, whether you're in my\ncase where I was spending it in the office"},"1902":{"dur":4,"text":"or you're spending it at home with\nyour child, is
