pit,"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"is used, as, I find very interesting."},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the first times that it's used,"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're all used by

man who is sick."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, one of the first\nthings that we have to remember"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"is that God is not condemning us to a pit."},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"That God's desire for\nus is that we come out,"},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"he doesn't want us to stay in\nthe situation that we're in."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, as, when I was 11 years
