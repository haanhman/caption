supernatural."},"760":{"dur":3,"text":"He makes us feel\nthat it's actually part of our world,"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"even though\nit's really separate from it."},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"Something else you may have noticed\nabout the figure of Christ"},"770":{"dur":4,"text":"is the way in which the light\nis depicted on his robe"},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"is extraordinarily

representing dawn"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"because we know that\nfrom the narrative of the Gospel,"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"that it's just before day\nis breaking,"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"it's at night that this is happening."},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"That is what is represented\nin the painting."},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the painting is suffused\nwith this lovely rosy

sort of details in gold."},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it's as if the light,\nthe divine light,"},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"is not just coming from the sky,"},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's being

details of the natural world\nhe depicts in it."},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"I said towards the beginning\nof this talk"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"that Bellini didn't like\nto depict things he didn't

look at the back,"},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"at the city, at the background"},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"beyond which everyone\nis coming to Christ,"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll see that it really is\nsupposed to be Jerusalem."},"856":{"dur":5,"text":"There are parts of it that are really\nmeant to represent an ancient city."},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"It's very, very different\nin Bellini's picture."},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"You might be able to notice\nthat rather than one town,"},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"there are three little\nsort of little settlements in the picture."},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"One of them has a church\nvery obviously in it,"},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's the one\nthat's just again in front of Christ,"},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"and it

spaces in the painting,"},"889":{"dur":1,"text":"these little hill towns,"},"890":{"dur":3,"text":"are of course much more typical\nof 15th and 16th century Italy"},"894":{"dur":1,"text":"than they

beautiful,"},"950":{"dur":3,"text":"and make Bellini's evocation\nof somewhere he'd never seen"},"953":{"dur":1,"text":"so very, very convincing."},"955":{"dur":1,"text":"One of those is the picket
