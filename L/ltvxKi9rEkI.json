easier,"},"2356":{"dur":3,"text":"but the best places are those close to the river mouth."},"2359":{"dur":4,"text":"Here, the salmon arrive in their prime, their bodies full of nutritious

to invade it is quickly repelled."},"2414":{"dur":4,"text":"It doesn\u2019t make much sense to fight with so much food around,"},"2418":{"dur":2,"text":"and the intruder does not put up much resistance."},"2421":{"dur":3,"text":"But he\u2019s not resigned to leaving empty-handed."},"2424":{"dur":3,"text":"When no one is looking, he grabs a fish that has been thrown aside,"},"2427":{"dur":4,"text":"and finally is able to enjoy a fat, juicy salmon."},"2445":{"dur":5,"text":"Though the bears continue to feed on the salmon, at this time of summer, fishing has become almost a game"},"2450":{"dur":3,"text":"and they don\u2019t even eat the majority of those they catch."},"2453":{"dur":5,"text":"The salmon that have been discarded then have a second

the salmon to one final test."},"2710":{"dur":4,"text":"Those that don\u2019t spawn near the river mouth, but swim inland against the current"},"2715":{"dur":4,"text":"are more than likely to face the

cases can be three metres high."},"2739":{"dur":3,"text":"Very few manage it."},"2742":{"dur":5,"text":"Exhausted by the effort, the majority are barely able to jump half the required height."},"2747":{"dur":3,"text":"But if they don\u2019t manage it, they will die in the attempt."},"2766":{"dur":4,"text":"Little by little, new arrivals reach the bottom of the waterfall,"},"2770":{"dur":4,"text":"and soon it is full of salmon trying to make the tremendous leap"},"2774":{"dur":5,"text":"Their parents managed it the year before, so it is an obstacle that can be overcome."},"2787":{"dur":3,"text":"The further inland, the more exhausted the salmon will be,"},"2790":{"dur":3,"text":"but Mother Nature compensates for this."},"2793":{"dur":4,"text":"Those salmon that spawn along the upper reaches arrive at the coast with more fat,"},"2797":{"dur":3,"text":"and so more reserves, than those that remain at the river mouths."},"2800":{"dur":7,"text":"Thanks to this, they will still have the strength to once again overcome the harsh trials to which Alaska faces them with."},"2831":{"dur":4,"text":"Finally, after many hardships, the salmon make it to their respective spawning grounds."},"2835":{"dur":3,"text":"For some, however, it is too late."},"2838":{"dur":6,"text":"The constant effort has exhausted their strength and they have died just as success was within their grasp."},"2844":{"dur":2,"text":"Their companions are not in a much better state,"},"2847":{"dur":4,"text":"but hey still have a mission to fulfil, and time is running out."},"2865":{"dur":3,"text":"After choosing a suitable place, the salmon prepare their nests."},"2868":{"dur":5,"text":"This consists of a small hollow which the female digs with strong movements of her tail."},"2874":{"dur":4,"text":"Behind her, a male has just chosen her as his mate,"},"2878":{"dur":4,"text":"and is anxiously waiting for her to deposit the eggs, so he can fertilise them."},"2897":{"dur":5,"text":"There are constant challenges from competitors, and every few seconds the male  has to fight them off."},"2902":{"dur":5,"text":"Meanwhile, the female has to contend with others trying to lay claim to her nest."},"2907":{"dur":4,"text":"Each member of the couple sees off those of its same sex."},"2924":{"dur":4,"text":"Funguses already cover their emaciated bodies, like a warning of approaching death."},"2928":{"dur":3,"text":"Their time is coming to an end."},"2939":{"dur":5,"text":"When the nest is ready, the female deposits over four thousand eggs in the river bed."},"2944":{"dur":6,"text":"As she does so, the male follows behind and, with compulsive movements, covers them with semen."},"2961":{"dur":1,"text":"It\u2019s all over."},"2962":{"dur":5,"text":"Thousands of miles and innumerable obstacles in order to reach this point."},"2967":{"dur":4,"text":"And once they have achieved their
