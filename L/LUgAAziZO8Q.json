the\nscientists there"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"couldn't get it to work either."},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"So in the end of\nthese 53 studies,"},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"he only got six to

along."},"365":{"dur":4,"text":"And he engaged his top\ndeputy, Larry Tabak,"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"to be the point\nperson for this issue."},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"They worked on it\ntogether a lot."},"375":{"dur":5,"text":"And among other things they\nwrote in one of the journals,"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"Collins explained,\nyeah, of course science"},"382":{"dur":0,"text":"is
