service provider's,"},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's not for the public record anyway."},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you add the owner of the company."},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"Now this is the key

jail."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"But this was an awful tragedy,"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"and it shouldn't have been so difficult"},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"just to try and find out who was responsible"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"for those deaths."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"Because in an age"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"when there is so much information"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"out there in the

this?"},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, there is only one way."},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"Together, we have to change the law globally"},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"to create public
