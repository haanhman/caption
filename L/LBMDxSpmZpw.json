\"pump bump\" is also known in that region,\nand that's also known as Haglund's deformity."},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"You could have esoteric causes."},"218":{"dur":1,"text":"One would be

foot."},"286":{"dur":3,"text":"You'll notice a band of tissue that runs from\nthe webbing of the toes, all the way back"},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"to the heel."},"291":{"dur":7,"text":"It attaches and inserts right onto the bottom,\nwhat's known as plantar, hence plantar fascia."},"299":{"dur":6,"text":"And it will have a little tear or insult injury,\nhence the lower redness that's provided here."},"305":{"dur":7,"text":"The arch, as you note right here, has to move\nup and down to absorb shock and transfer motion"},"313":{"dur":4,"text":"from the outside part of the heel until we\ntoe off with the great toe."},"317":{"dur":4,"text":"That puts an extraordinary amount of strain\nonto the plantar fascia."},"322":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, a lot of times, I'll see a pickup in\nmy practice with plantar fasciitis around"},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"March or April."},"329":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nAnd why is that?"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. James Graham:\nI'm glad you asked."},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"Most of us are sedentary during the winter."},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"We're not working out, we're not, you know,\nwe've lounged around."},"338":{"dur":4,"text":"We're thinking about taking those pounds off\nfrom the holidays."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"Then all of a sudden, we decide, okay, it's\ntime to do it."},"345":{"dur":4,"text":"It's getting nice outside, I can get in my\ntennis shoes, and I can go walk."},"350":{"dur":4,"text":"And because of that increased activity, the\nplantar fasciitis will occur."},"354":{"dur":4,"text":"Now typically, in the morning, here's how\nplantar fasciitis presents itself."},"359":{"dur":6,"text":"It's usually the first 10 to 15 steps that\nare notoriously uncomfortable, and then it"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"slowly eases up."},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like, okay, I can deal with this."},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"This isn't too bad."},"370":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nWhy does it hurt so much in the morning?"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. James Graham:\nThe foot has been at rest."},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"And this can happen in the evening."},"375":{"dur":5,"text":"You sit down, watch a TV program, and then\nyou get up and go to get something to drink"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"or eat, and then you feel it again."},"382":{"dur":6,"text":"So, that\u2019s the typical presentation of plantar\nfasciitis, as opposed to tarsal tunnel syndrome,"},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"where it starts off very well in the morning,\na little uncomfortable."},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"But the longer you're on the foot, the worse\nit gets."},"396":{"dur":6,"text":"Remember, the tibial nerve runs right behind\nthe tibia, and divides into branches."},"402":{"dur":6,"text":"Medial calcaneal, lateral calcaneal, plantar,\nmedial, and lateral branches."},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"And it is bound down by a ligament and held\nin position."},"413":{"dur":5,"text":"If it is too tight, that motion of the foot\nwill cause irritation in the nerve."},"418":{"dur":5,"text":"Presentations with that would be numbness,\ntingling, electrical activity."},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"But activity drives that one."},"426":{"dur":7,"text":"Even though plantar fasciitis has been caused\nby activity or inactivity, but that is the"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"difference."},"434":{"dur":4,"text":"And usually that is diagnosed by an exam,\na full medical exam."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm wanting to check out the nervous system."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"There are two signs for tarsal tunnel."},"444":{"dur":5,"text":"The first one is called the Tinel sign, and\nthe second's called the Valleix sign."},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"These are two French neurologists."},"451":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nYou're giving us all sorts of good medical"},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"terms today."},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"Your patients are going to come in and

to\ngo."},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"But in any case, those two signs."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"The Tinel's is when you percuss the nerve."},"466":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I will take a neurological hammer and\npercuss it, tap it."},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"If it shoots upward, that is the Tinel sign."},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"There's pain around it, as well as the Valleix\nsign is the upward migration."},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"We've all hit our elbow, hit the funny bone."},"481":{"dur":7,"text":"That's the ulnar nerve, and usually you feel\nit radiating out into the lateral three digits."},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a normal response."},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"However, if it goes to the armpit, that's\nthe wrong direction."},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it's telling me there's something with\nthe nerve."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"The third sign would be Lasegue sign."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, another French neurologist."},"501":{"dur":4,"text":"It's the straight leg raise, where I straighten\nout the leg, and I raise it and flex it at"},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"the hip."},"507":{"dur":5,"text":"That puts abnormal tension upon the sciatic\nnerve, or the nerve segments coming from the"},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"back."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that would indicate that's more back involvement."},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can have both going at the same time."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nI had a question about, for people with plantar"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"fasciitis, does it matter if you have a flat\nfoot, a high arch?"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"Does it have anything to do with the anatomy\nof your foot?"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. James Graham:\nIt does."},"530":{"dur":4,"text":"The higher arch will have tighter structures\nput upon the plantar fascia."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"The lower arch is elongated."},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, there's still motion that's afforded\nunless you're a rigid flatfoot deformity,"},"540":{"dur":5,"text":"which brings on a whole host of other problems,\nplantar fasciitis being one of them."},"546":{"dur":5,"text":"So, the dynamics, the anatomy itself is inherent\nto develop plantar fasciitis."},"551":{"dur":7,"text":"I see it in both flatfoot, as well as a high\narched foot and in the normal foot."},"559":{"dur":5,"text":"Another condition is known as Sever's disease,\nand I see a lot of children, usually from"},"564":{"dur":4,"text":"the age of 9 to about 14, 15."},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"And what that is, is the growth plate that's\nlocated within the foot, and it will be in"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"this region of the back of the heel."},"576":{"dur":6,"text":"That, the calcaneus is the longest bone, it's\nthe long bone in the foot."},"582":{"dur":7,"text":"And it will grow in both directions, both\nforwardly, which is known as anteriorly, posteriorly,"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"which is in the back, from the growth plate."},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, the growth plate is not the same type\nof cartilage we have in joints, but it is"},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"a precursor to bone."},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, as it grows from that growth plate,\nit becomes very flexible at times."},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not hardened bone yet, so there's plasticity\nto it."},"608":{"dur":7,"text":"So, the compression of the plantar fascia\nand the tendo-Achilles will press on that"},"615":{"dur":5,"text":"growth plate, and because it's not fully solid,\nthere could be shearing forces going, as well."},"621":{"dur":5,"text":"Typically, they'll hurt right during activities:\nbasketball, number one bringer into the office."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like, \"Ah, I've been playing basketball,\nand I'm dying here."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"I can't finish the game.\""},"632":{"dur":5,"text":"Rest is key on all of these, just to rest\nthe part and give the body a natural chance"},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"to heal."},"638":{"dur":8,"text":"Stretching of the calf muscles, which is the\nAchilles tendon, will help alleviate some"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"of the strain that's going on into that area."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nWe talk about Achilles tendonitis."},"651":{"dur":4,"text":"You hear about people tearing their Achilles\ntendon, does that have anything to do with"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"Achilles tendonitis?"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. James Graham:\nWell, if you tear the Achilles tendon, you"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"now have Achilles tendonitis."},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"Because, that \u201c-itis\" means inflamed, okay?"},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you put it on tonsillitis, inflamed\ntonsils."},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"Could be infectious, could be irritated from\nmechanical abrasions."},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"Appendicitis we know is inflammation of the\nappendix, sometimes infectious, sometimes"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"it's just gotten inflamed."},"680":{"dur":5,"text":"When we talk about the tendonitis, inflamed\ntendon, I see it in two areas."},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"Number one, in the midsubstance of the tendon\nitself."},"689":{"dur":5,"text":"That area is prone to injury because its supply\nof vascularity is low."},"695":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nOkay, meaning it just doesn't have a lot of"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"blood supply."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. James Graham:\nIt doesn't have a lot of blood supply, so"},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"it succumbs to the injuries."},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"Usually, a rapid, abrupt force."},"704":{"dur":5,"text":"Jumping, landing on the ball of your foot,\na lot of tension, and it can pop and tear."},"710":{"dur":4,"text":"Again, weekend warriors are notorious for\ndeveloping this."},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"Some develop just over use because they are\nvery tight in the heel cord, and there's such"},"718":{"dur":5,"text":"a pull and a demand at its point of attachment,\nwhich is the middle one-third of the back"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"of the heel, and that can become inflamed."},"727":{"dur":5,"text":"There's also a bursal sac protecting that\ntendon from the calcaneus in between."},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"We call that bursitis, inflammation of the\nbursal sac."},"736":{"dur":3,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nSo, if you have Achilles tendonitis, what's"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"going on?"},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"Is it stretched?"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. James Graham:\nWell, again, it depends on its location."},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"If it's here, it's insertion, attachment."},"748":{"dur":7,"text":"If it's located out here, which is about an\ninch or 2.5 centimeters above its attachment,"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"then it's a midsubstance tear or insult."},"758":{"dur":6,"text":"A lot of times, conservative management, a\nCAM walking boot, for example, rest, I've"},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"gotten people out of it, and I didn't have\nto mandate a surgical response to it."},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"And I like that approach because you can have\ncomplications from surgery."},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"Even though the surgery was executed perfectly,\ndoesn't mean you're going to respond perfectly."},"778":{"dur":4,"text":"And again, so I try to exhaust the conservative\nmanagement first."},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"However, when it's torn, the gig is up."},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"We've got to repair it."},"786":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nWhat are, let's kind of run through some of"},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"the causes."},"789":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, you've talked about weekend warriors,\noveruse."},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"What about our weight?"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"Does that have, lead to...?"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. James Graham:\nWeight unfortunately does play."},"799":{"dur":6,"text":"Just try and imagine if you put a 50 pound\nbackpack and just walk around, you will know"},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"things don't feel right."},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"We can feel it with our clothes when we gain\nweight."},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"God, this used to fit."},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"It's uncomfortable."},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"But weight does add to it."},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"You're just adding more forces going through\na weakened structure."},"819":{"dur":5,"text":"So, encouraging, always, we're fighting constantly\nour weight, weigh, trying to keep it down."},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"I know I do."},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"Also, our activity level."},"829":{"dur":5,"text":"If you're sedentary, before you go out for\nthat walk, please stretch."},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"And I like the stretching where it's static."},"837":{"dur":5,"text":"You just lean up against the wall, feet are\nshoulder distance apart, they're straight"},"842":{"dur":5,"text":"to slightly in-toed, knees straight, heels\non the ground, lean forward and hold."},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"Hold for 60 seconds."},"849":{"dur":1,"text":"That's really important."},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"The reason why, when I take my neurological\nhammer, and I check your reflex, what I'm"},"854":{"dur":4,"text":"doing is I'm hitting the ligament that stretches\nthe muscle."},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, when that happens, there's a natural\nreflex to contract."},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you don't want to bounce."},"865":{"dur":5,"text":"You don't want to stand on a step and lower\nthe heel because there's that natural tendency"},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"to contract, relax, contract."},"872":{"dur":6,"text":"You want a nice, steady, static, not ballistic,\nstatic hold for 60 seconds to override that"},"879":{"dur":5,"text":"Golgi tendon apparatus, which is part of the\nreflex."},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"Muscles work as a gliding mechanism."},"887":{"dur":5,"text":"So, when you start to work out, when you're\ndoing anything, you want to increase circulation"},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"to those muscles because you're going to put\na demand on them."},"895":{"dur":3,"text":"So, by stretching, we're increasing the blood\nflow."},"899":{"dur":6,"text":"Also, we're trying to maximally stretch out\nthose muscle fibrils so they can glide more"},"905":{"dur":1,"text":"efficiently."},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"If you start off like this, you're going to\nhurt yourself."},"909":{"dur":4,"text":"You want to have a good gliding mechanism,\nand that's why the stretching is so beneficial."},"913":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nOkay, what about shoe choice?"},"915":{"dur":4,"text":"Let's just talk about shoe choice when you\ndecide to go out for a walk or a jog, or something."},"920":{"dur":3,"text":">>Dr. James Graham:\nWell, shoes obviously have a great bearing"},"924":{"dur":1,"text":"into
