back"},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"for ongoing monitoring and assessment before the court."},"471":{"dur":5,"text":"The report, then, recommends ways in which the correction system can be used more effectively."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"To monitor offenders whilst they\u2019re in the community,"},"478":{"dur":6,"text":"to intervene in rather than perpetuate the cycle of violence in custodial settings,"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"to use these settings to screen for and identify"},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"family violence perpetration in the general population of

transmission of family violence between generations"},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"by responding more effectively to adolescents who use violence in the home"},"510":{"dur":7,"text":"as well as to children at risk of the profound harm that we know that exposure to family violence can cause."},"517":{"dur":7,"text":"Overall, these recommendations are about removing the burden from victims of family violence"},"524":{"dur":4,"text":"and placing that burden squarely on the system."},"529":{"dur":5,"text":"Just as urgently, therefore, the report calls for us to face up to our own accountability"},"535":{"dur":5,"text":"as individuals, as jurisdictions, and as a population at large."},"540":{"dur":7,"text":"Family violence is quite simply the greatest threat to our collective wellbeing."},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"If we\u2019re serious about tackling this threat head on therefore,"},"551":{"dur":6,"text":"we need to be prepared to commit to more and targeted resources for support services,"},"558":{"dur":5,"text":"first and foremost, but also for additional interventions right along the spectrum"},"564":{"dur":4,"text":"which may ultimately see these services experience less demand."},"568":{"dur":5,"text":"After all, we know enough about the costs of family violence to realise that"},"574":{"dur":9,"text":"simply doing more of the same is not going to stem its ongoing drain on our social and economic future."},"583":{"dur":4,"text":"What\u2019s more, and as an example in this report highlights,"},"587":{"dur":5,"text":"interventions which prevent even one family violence related homicide"},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"provide undeniable returns on investment."},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"Substantial though the challenge might be, therefore,"},"600":{"dur":3,"text":"and as entrenched as patterns of violence are in many of those who use it,"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"understanding of the cause of family violence and the"},"607":{"dur":4,"text":"attitudes which support it has reached a crucial stage,"},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"as has the community\u2019s motivation to do something about it."},"614":{"dur":5,"text":"As Rosie herself has emphasised, our overall focus needs to shift"},"620":{"dur":7,"text":"from simply expecting a victim to keep herself safe, to leave, to report breaches, to testify;"},"628":{"dur":7,"text":"to demanding the perpetrators take responsibility for their violence and an effective intervention is applied."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"Equally, our focus needs to shift from"},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"hoping that the law will address a single incident to"},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"ensuring that repeated interventions might also"},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"break the cycle of violence for subsequent generations."},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"As a former politician, I know they certainly spend a great deal of time"},"655":{"dur":6,"text":"talking about valuing families as well as about securing our social and economic future."},"662":{"dur":8,"text":"Addressing the violence occurring within these families then, is a crucial way of doing both."},"670":{"dur":4,"text":"This report explains there are things that we can do now to mount a more"},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"comprehensive and proactive response to family violence."},"679":{"dur":5,"text":"Its aim is to show that if we widen our gaze, we can make a start,"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"broadening the conversation, seizing opportunities, stepping in earlier"},"690":{"dur":7,"text":"and bringing perpetrators of family violence clearly, unequivocally, into view."},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"So I certainly want to thank all those who have contributed to

this is a gender issue."},"831":{"dur":4,"text":"It is a gender issue and it is about power and control"},"836":{"dur":4,"text":"and I\u2019m living testament to the worst of those cases"},"840":{"dur":5,"text":"when my little boy, Luke, was killed as a final act of power and control."},"846":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, Greg was able to dominate and control the court process because"},"851":{"dur":7,"text":"in the current format and the way it operates that happens all of the time."},"858":{"dur":11,"text":"When you do have an incident that you know is serious enough to take to the police,"},"870":{"dur":11,"text":"you don\u2019t know what danger you are placing yourself in by escalating the situation"},"881":{"dur":3,"text":"that you\u2019ve consta ... you have managed so far."},"885":{"dur":8,"text":"So an AVO is an option that we\u2019re given as if it\u2019s the final solution and it\u2019s going to solve everything."},"894":{"dur":7,"text":"Well, for many women it just doesn\u2019t because it is a piece of paper."},"901":{"dur":11,"text":"And do we respond to those breaches, seriously, while often they don\u2019t."},"913":{"dur":7,"text":"So right from the very beginning a perpetrator, somehow through his sense of entitlement"},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"and that the women is his possession and the children are his possession,"},"923":{"dur":8,"text":"doesn\u2019t get that firm message, right from the very beginning, that this behaviour is not tolerated,"},"932":{"dur":5,"text":"there are firm consequences should you step out of line,"},"937":{"dur":8,"text":"but also what\u2019s absolutely integral is that they are linked into intervention strategies."},"946":{"dur":9,"text":"Greg had mental health issues, he was homeless, he had marijuana usage,"},"956":{"dur":5,"text":"but very importantly, he was violent."},"962":{"dur":5,"text":"So if we have a look at how we intervene with someone like Greg"},"968":{"dur":8,"text":"to potentially stop a disastrous outcome, the court process, the judicial response"},"976":{"dur":5,"text":"can be the most effective player to link all of this together."},"982":{"dur":3,"text":"But currently, it is a random journey."},"986":{"dur":3,"text":"You may get an informed magistrate who may"},"989":{"dur":3,"text":"understand family violence and its complexities,"},"993":{"dur":4,"text":"they may believe the victim and may treat them with respect."},"998":{"dur":3,"text":"But there are a lot of maybes."},"1001":{"dur":4,"text":"So potentially, a journey for a victim is harrowing;"},"1006":{"dur":6,"text":"you work hard to be even believed, and in most cases unless you have the physical bruises,"},"1012":{"dur":7,"text":"your violence, whether it be control, financial, psychological, sexual are harder to prove"},"1020":{"dur":4,"text":"and give evidence and somehow they\u2019re not perceived as dangerous"},"1025":{"dur":6,"text":"but a lot of those instances are fatalities; it is power and control,"},"1032":{"dur":4,"text":"not necessarily the physical violence."},"1036":{"dur":10,"text":"But that stepping out of and making a decision to leave the relationship puts you in enormous danger."},"1046":{"dur":9,"text":"So I\u2019m thrilled to see a report that places the perpetrator into focus."},"1055":{"dur":12,"text":"Currently, we victim blame and somehow the perpetrator goes under the radar;
