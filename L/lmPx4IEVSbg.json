to realize"},"2998":{"dur":2,"text":"is that actually a lot of\nthese professional associations"},"3001":{"dur":3,"text":"and networks are made by\npeople who have a

wants,"},"3035":{"dur":3,"text":"about good quality duplicates."},"3039":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the aspects of what\nwas happening in Edinburgh"},"3041":{"dur":3,"text":"at the time is that\nwe had a director who"},"3044":{"dur":3,"text":"was very clear that we could\nde-accession and exchange."},"3048":{"dur":1,"text":"So it also coincides\nwith the moment"},"3050":{"dur":2,"text":"we are getting loan collections,\nbut we're exchanging these loan"},"3053":{"dur":1,"text":"collections."},"3054":{"dur":6,"text":"So what we discover is that in--"},"3061":{"dur":1,"text":"so that two sorts\nof discoveries."},"3063":{"dur":5,"text":"The first is that Edinburgh\nwants a range of objects."},"3068":{"dur":2,"text":"And Douglas wants very\nspecific art objects."},"3071":{"dur":2,"text":"So Edinburgh's always\ntalking about specimens."},"3073":{"dur":2,"text":"Douglas is always\ntalking about art."},"3076":{"dur":2,"text":"But Douglas is\nalso very conscious"},"3078":{"dur":1,"text":"that when he's talking\nabout art or when"},"3080":{"dur":1,"text":"Aldred is talking\nabout specimens,"},"3081":{"dur":2,"text":"they're actually talking\nabout the same thing."},"3083":{"dur":2,"text":"So they're playing a sort of\ninstitutional subtext type"},"3086":{"dur":1,"text":"game."},"3088":{"dur":3,"text":"The other aspect is that\nthere were some illusions."},"3092":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was rather confused by\nthis necklace on the left"},"3095":{"dur":2,"text":"until I realized one\nof the confusions"},"3097":{"dur":4,"text":"is this drawing, which is part\nof the record card at Denver,"},"3102":{"dur":3,"text":"because it makes it look as if\nthis is a necklace, essentially"},"3106":{"dur":2,"text":"a series of beads\nwith a pendant."},"3108":{"dur":2,"text":"But what you find when you go\nthrough the Denver Art Museum"},"3111":{"dur":2,"text":"records is that they came\nin as two separate objects"},"3114":{"dur":2,"text":"and they were\ncombined by Denver."},"3116":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the theories is\nthat Denver exchanged"},"3118":{"dur":5,"text":"objects that didn't have as deep\na provenance as might be ideal."},"3124":{"dur":4,"text":"The other thing that we know\nis that Edinburgh acquired--"},"3129":{"dur":3,"text":"If you look at the many\ntypes of Indian jewelry,"},"3132":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll notice that\nwe acquired pieces"},"3134":{"dur":2,"text":"from a range of\ndifferent styles."},"3137":{"dur":2,"text":"And in particular, we\nacquired number 10."},"3139":{"dur":3,"text":"So we acquired different--"},"3142":{"dur":4,"text":"Douglas was sending us a\nseries in terms of showing us"},"3147":{"dur":6,"text":"different types of material, and\nwe were sending Douglas Pacific"},"3154":{"dur":4,"text":"materials specifically,\nbut also we gave him gifts."},"3158":{"dur":2,"text":"So when material was\nbeing de-accessioned"},"3161":{"dur":2,"text":"from the African collection,\nthat was also sent to Denver."},"3164":{"dur":3,"text":"But it wasn't formally\npart of the exchange."},"3167":{"dur":3,"text":"So one of the things that\nI think in the 20th century"},"3171":{"dur":4,"text":"we find slightly peculiar\nis that actually curators"},"3175":{"dur":1,"text":"are being given the\nlicense to exchange"},"3177":{"dur":3,"text":"this material on a highly\nsubjective and sort"},"3180":{"dur":2,"text":"of gentlemanly type way."},"3183":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can think of this--"},"3185":{"dur":1,"text":"so you can think\nthat they're treating"},"3186":{"dur":1,"text":"these objects like commodities."},"3188":{"dur":2,"text":"Or you can think of them as\ntreating them like gifts."},"3191":{"dur":3,"text":"So if gifts are particularly\nvaluable objects that"},"3194":{"dur":2,"text":"are circulating in\nrestricted frames"},"3197":{"dur":2,"text":"according to certain\nregimes of value,"},"3200":{"dur":2,"text":"eventually these\nobjects are being"},"3202":{"dur":1,"text":"given a different--\nthey've been given"},"3204":{"dur":6,"text":"a commodity phase in their life,\nbut it's very circumscribed."},"3210":{"dur":3,"text":"The other aspect\nthat's quite intriguing"},"3213":{"dur":4,"text":"is that Denver Art\nMuseum always wanted,"},"3218":{"dur":4,"text":"or repeatedly requested, pieces\nfrom our Hudson Bay Company"},"3223":{"dur":0,"text":"collection."},"3224":{"dur":3,"text":"So the very early 18th\ncentury collections"},"3227":{"dur":1,"text":"that were made in\nthe 18th century"},"3229":{"dur":1,"text":"or the mid 19th century."},"3230":{"dur":3,"text":"And Edinburgh never gave this\nany serious consideration."},"3234":{"dur":3,"text":"Similarly Edinburgh\nrepeatedly asked"},"3238":{"dur":4,"text":"for silver-smithing\nequipment and molds."},"3242":{"dur":6,"text":"And we know that the John Adare\npieces were already in Denver"},"3248":{"dur":1,"text":"and they wouldn't exchange."},"3249":{"dur":3,"text":"So one of the other aspects\nis what can and cannot be"},"3252":{"dur":5,"text":"exchanged, which again lends\nsupport to this idea that"},"3258":{"dur":1,"text":"they're gifts."},"3260":{"dur":2,"text":"And it comes back to the\npoint at the
