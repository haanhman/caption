became\na privilege and an honor and I felt peace."},"831":{"dur":7,"text":"The next piece in the book that really got\nme was about this idea of impermanence."},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"And there\u2019s something that you wrote that,\nagain, was another moment, I\u2019m reading it,"},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"and I felt myself wanting to cry."},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"\u201cWhat\u2019s the
