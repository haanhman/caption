years,\nespecially of baby boomers,"},"44":{"dur":3,"text":"just to see what\nthey're thinking about\nin terms of housing."},"47":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the things that\nI think is very

was,"},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"many of them said\nanother 20 years."},"61":{"dur":1,"text":"And they've already\nbeen at their house"},"63":{"dur":1,"text":"for maybe 25 or more."},"66":{"dur":2,"text":"And so there's a real\ninterest of aging in place"},"69":{"dur":2,"text":"and staying in a\nplace that's familiar"},"71":{"dur":4,"text":"and probably the most

questions"},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"I said is define\nwhat is affordable?"},"122":{"dur":1,"text":"And the group came back with two"},"123":{"dur":2,"text":"or three hundred\ndollars a month in rent."},"125":{"dur":1,"text":"And while I understand\nthat's affordable,"},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"that is probably not\ngoing to be found,"},"130":{"dur":1,"text":"unless there are subsidies"},"132":{"dur":1,"text":"or other programs\nto help with that."},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's really clearly\ndefining what is affordable,"},"136":{"dur":3,"text":"depending on that rural\ncity or that metro city."},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"And what can people pay?"},"143":{"dur":1,"text":"- Right, and then\nalso, of course,"},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"what investors\nare willing to do."},"145":{"dur":1,"text":"And I know Minnesota, in\nsome ways, as you said,"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"is common because there's\nthe affordable housing issue"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"for workforce but I know,\nLaRhae, you'd said in some ways"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"Minnesota is also different in\nthat we have a lot of senior"},"155":{"dur":2,"text":"housing in Minnesota compared\nto other

what the most,\nthe next state down the list."},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"And it comes from a\nvariety of reasons,"},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"but I think that a\nlot of is that we want"},"176":{"dur":3,"text":"to provide good care\nfor our seniors."},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's often, especially\nin greater Minnesota,"},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"it's a more efficient way\nof providing that care"},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"through a congregate setting,\nsuch as assisted living,"},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"or even nursing\nhomes, 20 years ago."},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that means\nthat we have providers"},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"that are interested\nin doing that."},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"And also public partners,\ncity, county, state."},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"And over the years, that\nhas meant that we've had,"},"202":{"dur":4,"text":"we really have a very large\nsupply compared to other states."},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"The issue, again, is,"},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"the new version\nof senior housing,"},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"which tends to be\nassisted living,"},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"where you pay for rent and\nyou also pay for services,"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"that can be very expensive."},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, the seniors\nwho are in their home"},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"and trying to decide\nwhat the next move is,"},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"they're looking at that\nprice, because once a family"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"can no longer\nprovide care for you,"},"231":{"dur":1,"text":"you have to start\npaying for the care."},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"And that gets very expensive."},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"- And I'm sure what\nyou've seen, Lisa,"},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"is you've seen people\nwho are talking about,"},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"investors who are looking\nat one type of housing,"},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"investors looking at a\nsecond type of housing,"},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you also hear\nfrom, as you said,"},"246":{"dur":1,"text":"people in the\nworkforce or seniors"},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"trying to figure out,\nwhere do the go next"},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"and how do they afford it?"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"- Right, I think that\nthe senior housing,"},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"we do 55 and older\nor 62 and older."},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"I think the move is big."},"258":{"dur":1,"text":"I think, my seniors\nhave shared with me"},"260":{"dur":3,"text":"over and over, they're\nworried, they're scared."},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"Just leaving the\nhome is emotional."},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"Selling the home\ncan be a challenge,"},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"many times they're not\ncomparable to what's"},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"been in the market the\nlast 10 years or so."},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"And so there's issues."},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"We have an unbelievable\namount of people waiting,"},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"as soon as I sell my home,\nas soon as I sell my home,"},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"as soon as I sell my\nhome, I wanna live there."},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm like, I know you do."},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a challenge."},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"- So it's a challenge\nboth for the seniors"},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"as well as for other\npeople who are looking"},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"at finding it's affordable."},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"I know now, Lisa,\nyou also have been,"},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"you said you've\nbeen in this for,"},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"you told me during\nthe break you've been"},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"doing this for\nmore than 20 years."},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"So, big changes."},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's talk about\nwhat are the big changes"},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"that you've seen and\nwhat do you think's"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"coming next in the\nworld of housing?"},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"- Well, I think that a\nbig change for us was"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"the Supreme Court ruling\non disparate impact."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's how we do\nour background checks."},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"Many cities, if not all\ncities, want us to provide"},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"safe housing, and they\nwant to make sure that"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"we give people the right\nto live there safely."},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"So we do background checks."},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"The new ruling has made\nit to that we have to"},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"really change how we have\ndone that for a long time."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of it might be\ngood change, you know,"},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"how long ago did it occur?"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"Will it really impact the\nsafety of our residents?"},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"Maybe if it was 10 or 15 years\nago, we could live with it."},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"But maybe if it was\nin the last two years,"},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"we're also looking at\npatterns of behavior."},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"We see, we run\nhundreds of backgrounds"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"and we see a lot of\npatterns of behavior"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"that make us very nervous."},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"Disorderly conduct, you\nwouldn't think is very much,"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"but yet we can have\nsignificant penalties"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"for cities that have\nthree strike rules"},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"that hold us, as\nmanagement, ownership,"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"accountable compared to,\nnecessarily sometimes"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"holding the resident\nwho, in fact,"},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"had the disorderly, accountable."},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"- And that has been\na bit of a shift."},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yes."},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"- Shifting more of that question\nonto landlords, correct?"},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yes, and a strike can stay\nwith you for over a year."},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"You can end up, in fact, losing\nyour rental dwelling license"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"for that unit on the\nactions of someone else."},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's hard for us."},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"So then, of course, it\nmakes us have good policy."},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"So that we put people in that\nhave good rental history,"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"that can pay their rent."},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"When we went through a real\ndifficult economic time,"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"we had the highest receivables"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"I've ever seen in\nmy 20-some years."},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"It was devastating."},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"You can send as many\nlate letters as you want,"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"but if the household\ndoesn't have the money,"},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"they don't have the money."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was really\na difficult time."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"And so now that is improving,\nwhich makes us all,"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"economic improvement\nis good for everyone."},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"It's good for everyone."},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"People say to me,"},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Oh, I bet you hate that\nhouses are selling.\""},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"I never hate that\nhouses are selling."},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"Economic good times are\nsimply good for all of us."},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"And so people are\nmoving different places"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's all good."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"Right now, housing,\nwe have cities"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"that don't have\nenough product online."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's just coming full\ncircle, and this is what we do,"},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"we just track and watch."},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"- LaRhae, before we,"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"before we started this\ndiscussion, I know,"},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"you had a quote about\nhousing for multiple ages"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"that I thought was wonderful."},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"An Australian quote about\nhow, as we look at housing,"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"and as we look at\nthe housing supply,"},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"whether it's seniors or\nwhether it's younger people"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"or workforce, that there\nwas an Australian quote"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"that kind of captures\na way to approach this."},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yes, and I put it in\nour 2010 report, it says,"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"\"If you build for the\nyoung, you exclude the old."},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"\"If you build for the\nold, you include all,"},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"\"including the young.\""},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"Because when you do\naccessibility and\nthat sort of thing,"},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"it makes it easier for all\ngroups to really use it."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"- And of course, as you\nlook at the, at your job,"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"the silver tsunami we've\nheard so much about"},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"and how the baby boomers affect\nthe next wave in housing."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm sure you're seeing\nsome of the same things"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"that Lisa is in terms of\nseniors who have these"},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"concerns, they're trying\nto find the right place"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"and trying to make sure\nthat it works for them."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"What do you think\nthe trends are?"},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, I was thinking\nabout this because"},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"we are probably going to see\nmore assisted living built"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"because there are still\ngaps, especially affordable"},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"assisted living, however\nyou define affordable."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"But another interesting\ntrend that we're seeing"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"is the multi-generational\nliving arrangement."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"This happened during\nthe great recession"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"because the millennials\nstayed in the basement"},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughing)"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"because they couldn't\nafford something else."},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"But now what's happening,"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"there's the\nmillennial generation"},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"is taking a look at the\nboomers, their parents,"},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"and there's more\nmulti-generational\ngoing the other way."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"Where they're having\ntheir elderly parents"},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"come in and live with them."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that has, it's\nvery interesting to see"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"how that will affect\neven housing design"},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"and that sort of thing."},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"The other thing that's starting\na little bit in Minnesota,"},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"not as much as on the\ncoast, but shared living."},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we used to call\nthe geriatric commune."},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughing)"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"People wondered when the\nboomers were gonna go there,"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's not ever gonna\nbe a very big piece,"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"but we're starting\nto see some attempts"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"at having more shared living."},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"Because housing is the most\nexpensive part of a senior's"},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"budget and if you can share\nthat, it makes it easier."},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"- As we close out\nthis discussion,"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"I always want to let viewers\nknow where they can go"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"for more information,\nbecause it's a big topic"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"and we've just started\nto touch on it."},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"So, LaRhae,\nparticularly for seniors"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"who'd like to know\nmore about housing"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"and housing ideas\nand suggestions,"},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"where should they go?"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, they can go to\nthe Senior Linkage Line,"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"just Google that\nand you'll be able"},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"to find the telephone number."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"The Minnesota Housing\nFinance Agency"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"also has some really good\nreports on senior housing."},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"- Okay, Lisa, your advice?"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well, I would tell\nthem to try Housing Link."},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"That will give all\ntypes of
