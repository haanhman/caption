{"0":{"dur":4,"text":"[MUSIC]"},"4":{"dur":0,"text":"Hi, thanks for coming."},"5":{"dur":4,"text":"I want to talk to you all today about\nmatching in the digital market."},"10":{"dur":4,"text":"And basically, as you know, through the\nInternet we've made tremendous strides and"},"14":{"dur":3,"text":"progress in terms of what we can do and"},"17":{"dur":2,"text":"how they've affected markets\nin very positive ways."},"20":{"dur":4,"text":"I wanna talk to you briefly about how\nthat's gone on, but more importantly,"},"25":{"dur":4,"text":"I wanna look forward at some markets\nwhere there's been more limited"},"29":{"dur":3,"text":"success in terms of what you can do\nthrough online digital markets, and"},"33":{"dur":3,"text":"some of the opportunities to\ntake that to the next level."},"36":{"dur":3,"text":"So for example, obviously there are\nmarkets that have just been tremendously"},"39":{"dur":5,"text":"disrupted for the better,\noverall, such as books, and shoes,"},"45":{"dur":3,"text":"things like that that we traditionally\norder off of the internet now."},"48":{"dur":3,"text":"And much more efficiently than we\ndid when we had to go to stores or"},"51":{"dur":1,"text":"do it some other way."},"52":{"dur":3,"text":"But other markets,\nthere have been inroads, but"},"56":{"dur":2,"text":"there hasn't quite the big impact."},"58":{"dur":3,"text":"And the two I am gonna focus\non are the labor market,"},"61":{"dur":3,"text":"because I am a labor economist, and\nI wanna talk about the future of matching"},"64":{"dur":4,"text":"people to jobs using digital-based ideas."},"69":{"dur":3,"text":"And then the second one\nis the dating market."},"73":{"dur":4,"text":"Because this is an area I've\nended up studying quite a bit,"},"77":{"dur":3,"text":"both by personal experience, and\nthen I ended writing a book using"},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"the dating market to explain\nthe world of economics."},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"The book is called Everything I Ever\nWanted to Know About Economics I Learned"},"86":{"dur":1,"text":"from Online Dating, and"},"87":{"dur":3,"text":"some of the ideas in that book\nwhich go well beyond online dating."},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"There's discussions of carpet\nmanufacturing, of college admissions,"},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"of all sorts of things."},"95":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of those ideas will\ncome up a little bit today."},"98":{"dur":3,"text":"But like I said, we'll mostly focus on\nthe job market and the dating market,"},"102":{"dur":3,"text":"as well as some other places that\nhave been more clearly successes."},"107":{"dur":5,"text":"So what I wanna do is very quickly get\nthrough why digital markets have been so"},"113":{"dur":2,"text":"successful in the places\nthey've been successful."},"115":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think the basic idea there is\nthey've made markets very thick,"},"119":{"dur":1,"text":"made transaction costs lower."},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"So we'll just look back very briefly."},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'll talk about what are the\nimpediments to some of the markets where"},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"digital economy hasn't been as successful."},"128":{"dur":3,"text":"It's certainly been an important part of\nthe market in some of these markets, but"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"it hasn't been unequivocally successful."},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I wanna focus on\nthe three opportunities"},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"as I look forward in these\ntypes of digital markets."},"139":{"dur":0,"text":"And, in particular,"},"140":{"dur":3,"text":"I wanna think about harnessing big data\nto come up with better algorithms for"},"144":{"dur":4,"text":"matching workers to firms, or\ndates to each other, and things like that."},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"I wanna think about ways firms or"},"151":{"dur":4,"text":"online sites can help you verify what\nsomebody says on the Internet to try to"},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"get around some of the asymmetric\ninformation problems that come up."},"160":{"dur":3,"text":"And then finally,\nI wanna talk about the idea of signaling."},"163":{"dur":5,"text":"How you can think of ways or how sites,\nwebsites, can think of ways to help you"},"168":{"dur":5,"text":"verify what you say by sort of you\nshowing you mean what you mean."},"173":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a little different from verification,\nas I'll explain when we get to it."},"177":{"dur":4,"text":"So just briefly looking back on why the\nInternet's been so successful, I'm gonna"},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"use the word commodity a little\ndifferently than we would normally use it."},"187":{"dur":4,"text":"A commodity would typically be things\nwhere the market is perfect and so forth."},"192":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm gonna think of\ncommodities as anything where"},"197":{"dur":4,"text":"basically two different people can\nend up buying the same product."},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"Books, music, chairs, even Coke and"},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"Pepsi which are not commodities\nin the traditional sense."},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm thinking of those as commodities\nbecause if I buy Coke and you buy Coke,"},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"we're buying the same exact product."},"214":{"dur":5,"text":"And in those types of markets, the idea of\nthe Internet, what's made the Internet so"},"219":{"dur":5,"text":"successful is that the market has become\nvery thick for these products online."},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"So if I wanna go buy books,\nI don't have to go to my store and"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"hope that they have this book\nI'm looking for in stock."},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't have to go to the CD store and\nhope they have it in stock."},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't have to go to the shoe store and\nhope they have something I like."},"236":{"dur":5,"text":"I go on the Internet, and with a little\nbit of searching I get a lot of choices."},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"And as a result, because the market\nends up being bigger and"},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"more liquid, it's very efficient."},"246":{"dur":1,"text":"There's more price competition,"},"248":{"dur":4,"text":"aggregation of information about what's\nthe best product becomes more feasible."},"252":{"dur":4,"text":"And so basically, as a consumer my\nsearch costs are lowered quite a bit."},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"So places where we see this that have been\nincredibly successful are things like"},"260":{"dur":3,"text":"books, music, obviously streaming videos,"},"263":{"dur":3,"text":"I probably should have put shoes on\nmy slide, would be a great example."},"267":{"dur":4,"text":"And here, this picture gets at another\nexample of where commodity markets have,"},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"the Internet has really\ndisrupted the commodity market."},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"For those of you who have spent anytime\nin New York City, there's an area of"},"278":{"dur":4,"text":"the lower Bowery in New York City that was\nthe lighting district for years and years."},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"If you wanted to buy lights,\nyou would go down to this market, and"},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"it was this very organically\ngrown over time thick"},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"market where you could go from store to\nstore picking just the light you wanted."},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"Well if you go to the lower Bowery now,\nwhat you'll find is that the lower Bowery"},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"looks a lot nicer than it did\nback in those days overall, but"},"300":{"dur":3,"text":"the light district is\na shell of its former self."},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's because we used to think,\nokay, if I want to go buy lights,"},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"I need all this selection."},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"I have to go to the light\ndistrict to do it."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"But that market's been\ndisrupted by the Internet, and"},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"now people shop for lights online."},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"And they don't even have to bother going\ndowntown, much less to New York City,"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"if they live in the suburbs or\nsomething like that."},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is an example of\na commodity market that's been"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"really significantly improved."},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe not from the perspective\nof the retailers, but"},"330":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of the customers and so\nforth, in a very important way."},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"Now the same basic idea of the importance\nof thick markets plays out in"},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"differentiated goods, as well."},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"And now,\nwhen I talk about a differentiated good,"},"341":{"dur":4,"text":"what I mean is no two goods\nare exactly the same."},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"So examples that I'm gonna keep\ncoming back to are tickets, so"},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"if I go to a baseball game, there\nare many tickets that are similar, but"},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"each seat is distinct from the other one."},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"And even though it's the same seat as you\nwould have if you went the next night,"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"the game is different, and the pitchers,\nthe starting pitchers are different,"},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"things like that."},"364":{"dur":4,"text":"So literally, every product available in\nthe ticket market is slightly different,"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"at least when we talk about sporting\nevents or concerts and the like."},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"Houses, every house is slightly different."},"373":{"dur":4,"text":"But the two markets I'll probably focus\non the most are the job market and"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"the life partner market."},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"And here, you can see every\npotential employee is different."},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"There are no two that are identical."},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"Every potential life partner is different."},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"So thick markets are still very good\nin those types of environments where"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"all the goods are differentiated,\nbut for a different reason."},"393":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not about price competition,\nit's not about information aggregation."},"398":{"dur":5,"text":"It's about the fact that the more choices\nwe have in differentiated markets,"},"403":{"dur":4,"text":"the better we are likely to find\njust what we're looking for."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"And let me talk about that in a metaphor."},"410":{"dur":4,"text":"So think of yourself as,\nthink of the world of looking for a job,"},"414":{"dur":4,"text":"looking for an employee for\na job opening you have."},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"And imagine all the potential employees in\nthe world are spread out on a boardwalk."},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"And right in the middle of\nthe boardwalk is your job and"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"somebody who has the exact\nperfect qualifications."},"431":{"dur":5,"text":"And at one end of the boardwalk is all the\npeople who are unqualified for one reason,"},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"and at the other end of the boardwalk is\nall the people who are unqualified for"},"439":{"dur":0,"text":"some other reason."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's a little bit like Goldilocks."},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"Right by you in the middle,\nthose are the people who you really want."},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"The other end, they're too big or\ntoo small, or not smart enough,"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"or overqualified or something like that."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"And you could think of\nthe dating market the same way."},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"You're out looking for a potential\nlife partner, the person who would"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"be a perfect match for\nyou is right next to you on the boardwalk."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you spread everybody\nout across the boardwalk,"},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"there'd be people at one\nend who were very bad for"},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"you for one reason, people at the other\nend who were very bad for another."},"468":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, this is one type of boardwalk you\ncould have, where it's very crowded,"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"and near you on the boardwalk there's\ngonna be a lot of other people who"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"are very qualified for\nwhat you're looking for."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"And this would be another type\nof boardwalk you could have,"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"it's a very sparse boardwalk, and\nyou know it's not a thick market,"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"it's gonna be harder to find\njust what you're looking for."},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"So the internet can be very powerful at\nmaking markets thicker and bigger, and so"},"493":{"dur":5,"text":"for example if we take the example of\ntickets, the left boardwalk is StubHub and"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"the right one is the local ticket broker."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"They've all gone out of business, so it's\nnot even a good, there is no such thing as"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"the right boardwalk anymore, but\nbasically, the market thickened into this."},"510":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, along the same lines, you can\nthink of the left one as monster.com and"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"the right board walk as\nthe Palo Alto classified ads,"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"the Palo Alto weekly classified ads."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"Or the left boardwalk\nwould be match.com and"},"522":{"dur":4,"text":"the right boardwalk would be the people\nwho happen to be in a single's bar"},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"one night when you're out looking for\na date."},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, so which market do you wanna be in,"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"well it's pretty obvious you\nwanna be in the thicker market,"},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"you want a lot of people around you who\nare just like what you're looking for."},"537":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's not because of the competition\nand so forth, it's because,"},"541":{"dur":5,"text":"you want more choice among the people who\nare qualified for one reason or another."},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"So, now let's think about where has there"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"just been unequivocable success for\nmaking the market thick?"},"555":{"dur":6,"text":"Well, again, things like tickets, just no\nquestion, StubHub has been an incredibly"},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"efficient thing, makes selling and buying\ntickets much better than it used to be."},"566":{"dur":5,"text":"There's a site called oDesk and another\none called Elance, very efficient, again,"},"571":{"dur":4,"text":"these are freelancers doing various tasks,\nevery person in that market and"},"575":{"dur":5,"text":"every job that needs done is different,\nso it's the truly differentiated good."},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"And at the same time these markets worked\nvery well, there's review systems and so"},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"forth we'll come back to, Etsy's been\na very successful market as well."},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"There are other markets also very\nsuccessful with some limits to that"},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"success as I've already hinted at,\none of them is the housing market."},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"The housing market is a case\nof pure differentiated good,"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"every house is different, and\nthe internet helped you search for"},"603":{"dur":4,"text":"houses, but you only learn so much on\nthe internet, and you gotta go still spend"},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot of time with your broker\ngoing from house to house."},"611":{"dur":4,"text":"Another example of the other\ntwo examples already"},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"that I've hinted at quite a bit\nare the job market, where monster.com and"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"LinkedIn have lead to\ncertain efficiencies."},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"But, the reason I'm saying\nthe success of that is limited is,"},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"as a labor economist I can tell you\nthere's been a lot of research on this,"},"631":{"dur":4,"text":"and the Internet is having important\neffects on the labor market but it's not"},"636":{"dur":4,"text":"that they've had any sort of first order\ngreat impact that we can point to."},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"They've saved people some money\nin terms of resume, time and so"},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"forth, but in some ways they've\nalmost made it too easy to apply for"},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"jobs, because you can just send off\napplications so quickly and so easily,"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"then on the one end they've made the\nmarket thicker for potential emplacement,"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"almost too thick and\nI'll come back to that idea in a minute."},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"Same with dating, online dating was\nhugely successful for me and for"},"661":{"dur":5,"text":"many other people, but there are a lot of\nother people who have been, who still find"},"666":{"dur":5,"text":"it intimidating, who are thrown off by\nthe misrepresentations and so forth."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"And so\nwe wanna talk about how can we take some"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"of the places where there's been some\nsuccess but it's been limited and"},"677":{"dur":4,"text":"move them up into the category of\nplaces that have been quite successful?"},"682":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think the difference and what we\nneed to get over comes down to two things,"},"686":{"dur":4,"text":"one of them is information,\nhow well represented and"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"how much potential\nmisinformation there is."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"And the other one is what are the stakes,"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"how big are the stakes\nof making a mistake?"},"698":{"dur":5,"text":"So let's think about that a little\nbit more, we want markets where"},"703":{"dur":4,"text":"everybody has an honest representation\nof the people they might interact with."},"708":{"dur":4,"text":"That's a good feature of markets,\nthat everybody understands and"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"can trust other people in the market,"},"717":{"dur":4,"text":"not all markets have that,\nas I'll come back to in one second."},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"And the other is what are the stakes,"},"724":{"dur":4,"text":"the more the differentiation,\nthe harder the market is to work out., so"},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"let's think about those two\nthings in the context of tickets."},"732":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, tickets are highly verifiable,\nif you go to StubHub, you get to see a map"},"737":{"dur":4,"text":"of the stadium, it shows you exactly where\nyour seat will be, sometimes, on some of"},"742":{"dur":4,"text":"the stadiums it will show you literally\nthe view from the seat you are sitting in."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's very limited opportunity,"},"749":{"dur":5,"text":"scope for misinformation, StubHub will\nguarantee the ticket and reprint it for"},"754":{"dur":4,"text":"you, so there's no, if you buy a ticket\non Craigslist there's all sorts of"},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"information problems cuz\nthe ticket could be a fake."},"762":{"dur":4,"text":"But on StubHub, they've gotten past that,\nit's a little more costly but"},"766":{"dur":4,"text":"it's highly verifiable, so the information\nasymmetry problem goes away."},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"The other thing about StubHub and"},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"about tickets is the risk is more limited,\nwhy is that?"},"777":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, if you make a mistake and you buy\nsome tickets to a game or to a show or"},"782":{"dur":4,"text":"something and they're not what you really\nwanted after a while you think it through"},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"and you decide you don't\nwant to go to that game or"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not gonna, you didn't lose that much."},"790":{"dur":5,"text":"You can either put them up for resale,\nand you've only lost the StubHub fees,"},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"or you can just eat the cost of a couple\nof tickets, and you're out 50 bucks or"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"100 bucks or something."},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, it's not trivial, you don't\nwanna throw that money around, but"},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not the end of the world."},"804":{"dur":5,"text":"So in this type of market, StubHub has\nbeen very successful, because basically"},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"They're able to limit your risk and\nverify exactly what you're getting."},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"On the job market,\nit doesn't work that way at all, so,"},"817":{"dur":4,"text":"there are lots of unknowns, resumes\nare very useful pieces of information,"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"references and so forth,\nvery useful pieces of information."},"825":{"dur":4,"text":"But, there's a lot unknown, we don't know\nthese other things until we meet people"},"830":{"dur":4,"text":"and interview them and work with them for\na while, it's not like buying a ticket."},"834":{"dur":5,"text":"And then the other thing is you can think\nthat it is very costly to make a mistake,"},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"if you hire somebody and they turn out\nto be a disaster, you have all sorts of,"},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"there is the potential for them to be very\ndisruptive while they're working there."},"847":{"dur":4,"text":"There's the difficulty and expense of\ncreating a paper trail if you want to go"},"851":{"dur":5,"text":"ahead and fire them or do anything like\nthat, there is potential severance pay,"},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"there is all sorts of expenses."},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"Another way of thinking about that is to\ngo back to the metaphor of the boardwalk,"},"863":{"dur":4,"text":"the boardwalk in tickets isn't quite\nthat long, if you make a mistake, and"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"you want a different ticket,\nit's not that costly to switch."},"869":{"dur":4,"text":"But at the job market, the people who\nare bad for you are very costly for"},"874":{"dur":4,"text":"you on the boardwalk, they're way down the\nboardwalk, they're a long walk for you."},"879":{"dur":3,"text":"So how are we gonna take the job market,\nand the dating market has a lot of these"},"883":{"dur":5,"text":"same features as the job market,\nhow are we going to take those, and"},"889":{"dur":5,"text":"try to turn them into something closer\nto the success stories of Etsy and"},"895":{"dur":4,"text":"StubHub and so forth where most of\nthese problems are not nearly as big?"},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, we need to solve the two problems\nI mentioned before, we need to solve"},"904":{"dur":5,"text":"the stakes problem, and we need to solve\nthe information asymmetry problem."},"909":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's start first with sort of\nthe stakes problem which is matching,"},"912":{"dur":6,"text":"get rid of the cost of a really bad match,\nand this is one where as an economist I"},"919":{"dur":5,"text":"don't have that much to say about it other\nthan I'm kind of trusting the market and"},"924":{"dur":5,"text":"trusting the people out there to use\nthe data to help solve this problem."},"929":{"dur":4,"text":"I feel there's a big business\nopportunity in the job market and"},"934":{"dur":5,"text":"in the dating market to harness the big\ndata we have on all these sites now and"},"940":{"dur":3,"text":"to try to use them to\ncreate better algorithms."},"944":{"dur":4,"text":"So the big business opportunity number\none in these markets that I see is taking"},"948":{"dur":4,"text":"the big data and figuring out an algorithm\nthat's going to help you match better than"},"952":{"dur":4,"text":"anybody else, eHarmony, this was their\noriginal sell, that their algorithm was"},"957":{"dur":3,"text":"better And I don't think it's proven\nto be all that much more successful,"},"960":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think there's more opportunities\nto take that to the next level,"},"964":{"dur":2,"text":"take the algorithm to the next level."},"967":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, so that is where I think, that\nis big business opportunity number one."},"972":{"dur":3,"text":"Is let's think about how we can\nput our data scientists and"},"975":{"dur":3,"text":"other smart people to work\nto create better algorithms."},"979":{"dur":4,"text":"Now the second thing is two different\nways of solving the information"},"983":{"dur":1,"text":"asymmetry problem."},"985":{"dur":5,"text":"One is, what we can, we need to think\nof how jobs and dating sites can solve"},"991":{"dur":4,"text":"the problem the say StubHub did and make\nit very verified, what you're getting."},"995":{"dur":1,"text":"So how are we going to do that?"},"998":{"dur":2,"text":"It's been largely successful\nin the case of StubHub."},"1000":{"dur":2,"text":"It's also been successful\njust based on reviews and"},"1003":{"dur":5,"text":"user feedback in things like Airbnb and\neBay where the feedback systems give you"},"1008":{"dur":4,"text":"enough information to get rid of\nthe asymmetric information problem."},"1013":{"dur":2,"text":"But on the job market and\non the dating market,"},"1016":{"dur":2,"text":"there's been much less success on this."},"1018":{"dur":5,"text":"So LinkedIn has started using these\nreferences and these endorsements,"},"1023":{"dur":2,"text":"and other means of trying\nto help you verify"},"1026":{"dur":2,"text":"that you have skills that you\nwant people to know about."},"1028":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's making a step\nin the right direction."},"1031":{"dur":5,"text":"But I think there are opportunities to\ntake that a little bit further in the,"},"1037":{"dur":5,"text":"again, in the, with various other\ncertifications one can get professionally."},"1042":{"dur":3,"text":"They're gonna allow you, on your LinkedIn\nprofile, on Monster, to say, hey,"},"1046":{"dur":1,"text":"I really do have these skills."},"1048":{"dur":3,"text":"I really did manage certain sets\nof people and things like that."},"1051":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think credentializing and so\nforth, figuring out ways to do that in"},"1055":{"dur":5,"text":"an efficient, cheap manner is\na big opportunity for somebody,"},"1060":{"dur":4,"text":"be it LinkedIn or Monster.com or someone\nelse, to kind of disrupt the job market."},"1065":{"dur":3,"text":"On the dating market, there are actually\nsites in foreign countries,"},"1069":{"dur":2,"text":"both of the ones I know about are in Asia."},"1071":{"dur":4,"text":"Where they require that you\nsubmit government documents and"},"1076":{"dur":3,"text":"other verification to show that you\nare the height you

economists love."},"1163":{"dur":3,"text":"We try to use this idea all the time."},"1166":{"dur":3,"text":"And basically what it is, is it's\njust trying to figure out how to take"},"1169":{"dur":3,"text":"the things you say and make them credible."},"1172":{"dur":4,"text":"When it's hard to literally verify that\nyou say, you know, I make a lot of

an effective signal has\nto have two qualities."},"1227":{"dur":3,"text":"If I say to you,\nI really am interested in you."},"1230":{"dur":3,"text":"In order to find a way to show\nyou I'm really

job."},"1240":{"dur":1,"text":"Or whether I really am interested in you."},"1242":{"dur":1,"text":"Or whatever it is that\nI'm trying to signal."},"1244":{"dur":1,"text":"So the signal has to be\ncorrelated with the true,"},"1246":{"dur":3,"text":"underlying likelihood that I have that."},"1249":{"dur":1,"text":"And it also has to be costly."},"1251":{"dur":4,"text":"Because if anybody can

want a signal that's costly to\neverybody, but less costly to those for"},"1270":{"dur":2,"text":"whom it's very valuable to signal."},"1272":{"dur":1,"text":"So that sounds like a nice abstract idea,"},"1274":{"dur":3,"text":"but let's try to think about it,\nwhere do we see this happening?"},"1278":{"dur":3,"text":"Well I'm gonna start with dating,\nwhere it's already"},"1281":{"dur":4,"text":"been used successfully on a limited basis,\nand then I'll talk about the job market."},"1285":{"dur":4,"text":"Where I think the opportunity is much\ngreater and much more important."},"1289":{"dur":4,"text":"So in the dating market, men, as I said,\nthey lie about their ages and"},"1294":{"dur":1,"text":"their incomes, and things like that."},"1296":{"dur":4,"text":"But also, you'll see in a lot of\ndating sites where men will send out"},"1301":{"dur":3,"text":"just hundreds of messages to women saying,"},"1304":{"dur":2,"text":"I really want to meet you,\nor something like that."},"1306":{"dur":0,"text":"Something very generic."},"1308":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's fine."},"1310":{"dur":3,"text":"They might wanna meet people,

who may have\nthought through whether or"},"1321":{"dur":2,"text":"not they'd be a good match for you."},"1323":{"dur":5,"text":"So saying I would love to meet you,\ncompletely unverifiable."},"1328":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no way to signal."},"1330":{"dur":3,"text":"So how do I get around that\non a dating site if I'm man?"},"1333":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, signal number one that's open\nto anybody on any dating site, and"},"1337":{"dur":3,"text":"this was an important strategy for\nme and is an important strategy for"},"1341":{"dur":2,"text":"many people,\nis to personalize your message."},"1344":{"dur":3,"text":"So rather than sending a hundred messages\nthat say, hey, I want to meet you."},"1348":{"dur":4,"text":"You send ten, each of which says,\nhey, I looked at your website."},"1353":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm just guessing,\nwas that picture taken in Yosemite?"},"1355":{"dur":1,"text":"I've been there."},"1357":{"dur":3,"text":"That book you really

signal for"},"1366":{"dur":4,"text":"most people, but\nin my case it would be more of a positive."},"1371":{"dur":6,"text":"And so these personalized messages, they\nhave the idea I pointed to in a signal,"},"1377":{"dur":6,"text":"in that it's correlated with whether or\nnot you really have these things."},"1383":{"dur":2,"text":"Cuz you've taken the time to do it,\nand it's costly to you,"},"1386":{"dur":4,"text":"and it's a cost you're not gonna bother\nbearing if you're not actually qualified."},"1390":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's truly separating\nin a valuable way."},"1393":{"dur":4,"text":"Now that's all fine and good for\nus as consumers on a dating site or"},"1397":{"dur":3,"text":"job site, we might think of ways\nwe can signal appropriately, but"},"1401":{"dur":3,"text":"we can also ask the dating\nsite to help us."},"1404":{"dur":3,"text":"And a Korean dating site ran\nan experiment where they did just this."},"1408":{"dur":2,"text":"They had what was known as\nthe virtual rose system."},"1410":{"dur":2,"text":"So how did the virtual rose system work?"},"1413":{"dur":1,"text":"Over a period of time,"},"1414":{"dur":4,"text":"anybody on this Korean dating site could\nsend messages to anyone else on the site,"},"1419":{"dur":4,"text":"saying, I want to meet you, or\nwhatever their message was gonna be."},"1424":{"dur":3,"text":"And then during this period of time\nthey could also send two messages,"},"1427":{"dur":2,"text":"which were accompanied by a virtual rose."},"1429":{"dur":3,"text":"And a virtual rose just was\na way of credibly showing, hey,"},"1433":{"dur":4,"text":"you're one of the two people I'm most\ninterested in meeting on this site."},"1438":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay it was costly, not because they had\nto pay extra money for the virtual roses,"},"1442":{"dur":4,"text":"but because they couldn't send them to\nsomeone else, once they sent them to you."},"1447":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was highly correlated with\nwhether they were qualified,"},"1451":{"dur":1,"text":"because of course,\nthey're not gonna just send it to anyone,"},"1452":{"dur":2,"text":"they're gonna send it to the people\nthat they are truly interested in."},"1455":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was very effective."},"1457":{"dur":4,"text":"The people who sent virtual roses were\nmuch more likely to end up in dates,"},"1462":{"dur":3,"text":"and\/or relationships, with the people\nto whom they sent their virtual rose."},"1466":{"dur":4,"text":"Now having said that, we haven't\nseen this rolled out in any sort of"},"1470":{"dur":3,"text":"scaled way in websites across the world."},"1473":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the problem is, and\nthis is why it's an opportunity,"},"1475":{"dur":2,"text":"is thinking about how can you scale that?"},"1478":{"dur":3,"text":"Because on a one time basis,\nthat's a fine idea."},"1481":{"dur":3,"text":"But once you scale it, you get into all\nsorts of opportunities to game the system."},"1485":{"dur":5,"text":"You can have multiple profiles,\neach of which gets a signal."},"1490":{"dur":4,"text":"You're gonna run into the fact that you\nsee the same people again, and so forth."},"1494":{"dur":4,"text":"So thinking through the details of how\ncan we take that to the next level, and"},"1498":{"dur":2,"text":"make that a useful scalable idea?"},"1500":{"dur":1,"text":"That's an opportunity."},"1502":{"dur":4,"text":"It's specific to dating, but it sort of\ngets into, where I wanna go with this,"},"1507":{"dur":1,"text":"which is to think about the job market."},"1508":{"dur":6,"text":"So if you wanna get people to\ntake economists ideas seriously,"},"1514":{"dur":6,"text":"you go to the economists,\nbecause we listen to each other."},"1521":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, the one place we've really\ninfluenced, you signalling to"},"1526":{"dur":3,"text":"influence a job market, is the job\nmarket for hiring other economists."},"1530":{"dur":5,"text":"So what happens is, hiring economists is\na little bit like hiring MBA students,"},"1536":{"dur":3,"text":"every year each school that has people\navailable, puts together a packet of"},"1540":{"dur":3,"text":"the resumes of their students,\nthe people who are about to get their PhD."},"1544":{"dur":4,"text":"They send them out to other schools,\nand to other employers, and"},"1548":{"dur":4,"text":"they all interview in the same place,\nin January."},"1553":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's a very traditional way, and"},"1556":{"dur":3,"text":"a very routinized way,\nin which this process takes place."},"1560":{"dur":4,"text":"And a few years ago, we added to that\nprocess, each person looking for"},"1564":{"dur":2,"text":"a job, gets to send two signals."},"1566":{"dur":3,"text":"So in addition, to just applying to 100\njobs, with the equivalent off, hey,"},"1570":{"dur":4,"text":"I'd really like to work for you, you\nget to send two signals which indicate,"},"1575":{"dur":1,"text":"hey, I really wanna work for you."},"1578":{"dur":4,"text":"So you might do it, because your\nspouse has a job in Washington, so"},"1583":{"dur":2,"text":"you send your signal to\nGeorge Washington University."},"1585":{"dur":2,"text":"Or you might really want to\nteach in a liberal arts college,"},"1588":{"dur":3,"text":"and they might think you\nwanna focus on research."},"1592":{"dur":3,"text":"So you wanna credibly say, hey,\nI really wanna focus on teaching,"},"1595":{"dur":3,"text":"by sending your signal to\na liberal arts college."},"1598":{"dur":3,"text":"Well and for that type of thing,\nespecially it's been extremely effective."},"1601":{"dur":3,"text":"People who send signals on the mark,\nand again it's costly,"},"1605":{"dur":2,"text":"because I can only send two of them,\nso if I send one to you,"},"1607":{"dur":2,"text":"I've given up the opportunity\nto send it anywhere else."},"1610":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's been very effective."},"1611":{"dur":4,"text":"People who send signals, are much more\nlikely to get interviewed, and job offers,"},"1616":{"dur":2,"text":"and so forth,\nat the places to which they send a signal."},"1620":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to think about\nwhat's the right number."},"1622":{"dur":1,"text":"Two."},"1624":{"dur":2,"text":"Why not just one, why not five?"},"1626":{"dur":2,"text":"And we probably could experiment,\nwith that a little more, but"},"1629":{"dur":1,"text":"it's always been two."},"1631":{"dur":4,"text":"Opportunity number two, for\nsignaling, is jobs at Google."},"1635":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm thinking a little\noutside the box here, but"},"1638":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm just gonna throw this idea out there."},"1641":{"dur":1,"text":"And maybe,"},"1642":{"dur":4,"text":"at least it's worth thinking about in\na brainstorming session somewhere."},"1647":{"dur":3,"text":"So Google has a very good situation."},"1651":{"dur":3,"text":"Two million people apply for\na job at Google, every year."},"1654":{"dur":1,"text":"Two million people apply."},"1657":{"dur":1,"text":"That's really good."},"1658":{"dur":4,"text":"But of course, it's also really bad, cuz\nthey have to read 2 million resumes, and"},"1662":{"dur":1,"text":"job applications."},"1664":{"dur":2,"text":"So, choice, as economists we always say,"},"1667":{"dur":4,"text":"choice is good, but too much choice\ncan actually be problematic,"},"1671":{"dur":3,"text":"if there are transaction costs\nin considering those choices."},"1674":{"dur":5,"text":"So for Google, you might think, hey,\n2 million applicants is too many."},"1679":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, you might think it's\nactually a really good thing,"},"1681":{"dur":2,"text":"because they get the PR of saying\nthey have two million people, and"},"1684":{"dur":3,"text":"they're probably not gonna take my idea\nhere, and go with it, because they"},"1687":{"dur":3,"text":"probably don't want to give up on the PR\nof having two million applications."},"1691":{"dur":5,"text":"But one way, they could get people\nto signal that, hey, I really wanna"},"1697":{"dur":4,"text":"work at Google, is to charge them a little\nbit of money, to apply to work there."},"1701":{"dur":1,"text":"We do this, at the Stanford GSB."},"1703":{"dur":3,"text":"We charge people, a couple hundred bucks,\nto apply to the Stanford GSB."},"1706":{"dur":4,"text":"Why doesn't Google charge $10, $25,\ndoesn't have to be a big thing."},"1711":{"dur":2,"text":"Just enough,\nto make the person stop, and think,"},"1713":{"dur":3,"text":"do I really wanna impose my\nresume on somebody at Google?"},"1717":{"dur":3,"text":"Is it really worth my while to do this?"},"1720":{"dur":2,"text":"To make them internalize,\nthe cost of doing that."},"1723":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, if you think of those two\nmillion people, who are applying for"},"1727":{"dur":3,"text":"a job at Google, half of them are doing\nit, cuz they heard about the free food."},"1730":{"dur":2,"text":"This would be probably a good\nway to screen those people out,"},"1733":{"dur":2,"text":"before you have to bother reading\ntheir resumes, and the like."},"1736":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, from a PR perspective,\nthis would probably be very bad."},"1739":{"dur":2,"text":"If you said from now on, we're\ncharging $25 to apply, for a job here."},"1742":{"dur":4,"text":"But I think you could turn it into a PR\nvictory, if you just said we're gonna"},"1746":{"dur":4,"text":"charge you $25, but all the job\napplication money goes to the Red Cross,"},"1751":{"dur":3,"text":"or the Silicon Valley United Way, or"},"1755":{"dur":4,"text":"some other organization that everybody\ncould agree was a very good cause."},"1759":{"dur":3,"text":"So, that's one possibility, is Google,\nor Stanford, or some other employer,"},"1763":{"dur":3,"text":"that's very sought after could think\nabout, trying to get people to self"},"1766":{"dur":4,"text":"select, before they apply, to signal,\nhey, I really wanna work there."},"1771":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I don't know that Google's\ngonna take me up on that, but"},"1774":{"dur":4,"text":"one place where I think signaling\nwould work perfectly, and"},"1779":{"dur":5,"text":"could be done almost over night, is places\nlike LinkedIn, and www.monster.com."},"1784":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you're on LinkedIn, LinkedIn could\nallow you, the possibility of sending one"},"1789":{"dur":4,"text":"signal, or virtual, you wouldn't call it\na virtual rose in the employment process,"},"1794":{"dur":3,"text":"but just the exact equivalent\nof the virtual rose."},"1797":{"dur":3,"text":"You could say one, or two per month,\nyou can send to an employer saying, hey,"},"1801":{"dur":1,"text":"I really wanna work for you."},"1802":{"dur":5,"text":"And now, you're no longer just\none of 100 resumes in a pile,"},"1807":{"dur":1,"text":"you're the guy who said, hey,"},"1808":{"dur":4,"text":"I thought through all the places I might\nwanna work, and you're the place I chose."},"1813":{"dur":2,"text":"So www.monster.com,\ncould do something like this."},"1816":{"dur":5,"text":"LinkedIn, all of these places, allowing

forward."},"1895":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm thinking of three different\nforms of business opportunity,"},"1898":{"dur":3,"text":"to try to settle that, and\nboth make the world a better place,
