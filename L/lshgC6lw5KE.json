looking at\nduplication and we have a lot of"},"209":{"dur":3,"text":"agencies that do some\nof the same things"},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"and we need to decide what\nagency should be doing it"},"215":{"dur":3,"text":"and put it there and try to\neliminate the duplications."},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"Now getting to those\noffices, we have to take"},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"a good look at it

that"},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"and find out whether\nthere really is."},"237":{"dur":0,"text":"And so,"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"as far as eliminating the\nTreasurer, I know they"},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"only have a staff of\neight people up there"},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"and they do some important\nwork, believe me Dave,"},"247":{"dur":4,"text":"if they send money out

the State Treasurer"},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"were to be eliminated,\nit would have to be"},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"put on the ballot\nby the legislature"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"and the people would\ndecide, whereas"},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"the Securities Commissioner,\nthe legislature could"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"put them with either the\nInsurance Commissioner"},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"or maybe the\nBanking Commissioner"},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"and the securities\ncould be together."},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"- So there are some options\nyou can take a look at."},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Rich] Yes."},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"- And see if there are\nactual savings to be had."},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Rich] Correct."},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"- One thing, one area that\nI'm hearing a lot about"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"in looking at potential\nsavings is higher education,"},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"especially what they call\nthe back office things."},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"Old financial officers,\nthat type of thing."},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"That there could be\nsome savings in that"},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"and I assume your\nAppropriations Committee"},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"is really looking at that\nwith a fine tooth comb."},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yes they are, Dave."},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"And I want you to know that\nwhen you talk to legislators,"},"322":{"dur":3,"text":"they want those professors and\nteachers in the classrooms."},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"They don't feel that that's\nwhere the cuts need to come."},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"They feel that in the\nadministrative sector"},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"of the university is where\nthose cuts have to come."},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"- And there's, you believe\nthat there probably are some"},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"reductions that\ncould be made there."},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"- We believe that\nthere are some there."},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"And that they could\nconsolidate some of the jobs"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"of some of these people\nthat are vice presidents"},"348":{"dur":4,"text":"and administrators and\nchairmen of certain areas"},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"so that maybe one person\ncould do the same job"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"that two people are doing now."},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"- You know it's interesting,"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"this is getting a\nlot of attention."},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"But I'm not really\nhearing a lot of panic."},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"This is not a time to\npanic, it's just a,"},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"it's a correction, perhaps."},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"- That's right."},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"And I want you to know that,"},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"when Appropriations talks\nto the institutions,"},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"the institutions,\nthe institutions have"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"the ability to bring\nforward the programs"},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"that they think can\nbe combined, and,"},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"it's not a dictatorial\nthing, but they"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"have input into\ntheir priorities."},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"- And they understand that the"},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"state's budget is a\nlittle bit tighter."},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yes, they do."},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"- Lot of things have\nbeen talked about about"},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"property tax reform, your\nFinance and Tax Committee"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"headed the bill this week\nin order for the state"},"409":{"dur":4,"text":"to take over full funding of\ncounty social service programs."},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"Where do you stand on that?"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well, I would like\nto see the state"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"get out of the\nproperty tax business."},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd like to see us take it over."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"I know that others feel that,"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not gonna work out."},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"But I, those are mils that\nyou're gonna take off the rolls."},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"They're not, they can't be\nbackfilled as some people say."},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"And there is a plan\nthere to transition out"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"over a period of time\nbecause I want you to know,"},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"that the 12 percent buydown\nis more money than we need"},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"to take over the human, or\nthe county social services."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's gonna be\nsome more money there"},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"that we would use to do\nkind of a phase out program"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"over three or four bienniums."},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"- But in order, if\nyou do that then,"},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"then the state\ncan get out of the"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"property tax relief business."},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"- They can."},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course a lot of\nlegislators are concerned."},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"Should the county\nsocial services combine?"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"You know we have\nsome small counties,"},"475":{"dur":4,"text":"we have programs that can be\ncombined in different counties."},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"And so they would like\nto see some efficiencies."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"And they're afraid that\nthat isn't gonna happen"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"if the state takes it\nover but, you know,"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not gonna happen now if the"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"counties are in charge, either."},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"- Let me go to\nanother issue and,"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"it was brought up\nboth in, I think,"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"Governor Dalrymple\nhad it in his budget,"},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"I think Governor Burgum still\nhas it in his budget proposals"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's this provider\ncharge or provider tax"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"on nursing homes, it's about\nfive percent if I'm correct?"},"513":{"dur":0,"text":"- Well..."},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"I think might be a little\nmore, yeah about five percent."},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"I just want, so that\nyour viewers understand,"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"North Dakota has a situation\ncalled equalization of rates."},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"It simply means that\nif you are on Medicaid,"},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"you would pay the same for\nthose that are private pay"},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"or private pay pays the\nsame as those on Medicaid"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"that are in the\nsame classification."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"So what happened when we did\nthe allotment last summer."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"First of all we took away\nthe General Fund dollars."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"Then along with\nthat, those, you have"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"the matching federal\ndollars that go away because"},"551":{"dur":4,"text":"for every state dollar there's\na dollar of federal money."},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"But what's, so that\nmeant that the pay for"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"those on Medicaid went\ndown, which also meant"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"that the private pay\nhad to come down."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"So that it's really\na triple whammy."},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"And so this proposal\nof a provider tax"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"on nursing homes, it's\nreally a provider tax"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"or an excise tax on\nthe private pays."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"They're the ones\nwho would pay it."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"It would circumvent the\nequalization of rates"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"because they would\nend up paying more"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"because they'd pay the\ntax and get the money"},"587":{"dur":4,"text":"so that the state would use\nthat money to get federal match."},"591":{"dur":4,"text":"That has not been very well\nreceived by the legislators."},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"Neither the House nor the\nSenate is in favor of that."},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we're gonna need\napproximately 20 million dollars"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"to take care of nursing\nhomes to get 'em back"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"to where they were\npre-allotment."},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"- 20 million dollars."},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"- That's right, we have\nto find it in our budget."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"And so that's a priority."},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"That is a priority."},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"- So I guess the idea is now,\nwhere do you look under rocks,"},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"and you know in desk drawers,\nhow do you find the money?"},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"- Well, I'll just\ntell you that yes, we,"},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"we took and downsized\nthe Dalrymple forecast"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"about 170 million."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"So we've got our\nongoing revenue stream"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"at about 3.4 billion."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"That's 3400 million."},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"And, so we'll start\nbuilding from there."},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"And we have transfers."},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"We do have some money,"},"651":{"dur":4,"text":"in some areas that we did\nnot have back in 2003, Dave."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"Number one we have more\nmoney that we can take"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"from the Bank of North Dakota."},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"140 million, approximately."},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a transfer."},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"We have the legacy fund\nwhich is the first biennium"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"that we're able to use the..."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"Earnings from that."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"That's about 160 million."},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"And we also have the\ncommon schools trust fund"},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"which will put another\n82 million and more,"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"that was extra earnings\nthis time into the,"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"K through 12 funding."},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"And we have the foundation\naid stabilization fund"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"which was education,\nit was Measure 2"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"that the people released that."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"And there'll be some money\nthere that will help us."},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"Those are transfers."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"There are others, I'm not\ngonna go into any others but,"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"we'll have those to help us,"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"plus the fact we have to make"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"some cuts in the budget."},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's where the\nBurgum budget cuts come."},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"We will take a\nlook at his ideas."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"We're gonna use\nprobably a lot of them."},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"And, and some of our own,"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"to make sure that\nwe come out of here"},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"with a balanced budget and\nan ending fund balance."},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"- Not to put too fine\na point on it then,"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"you're saying that the\nprovider tax is probably"},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"not going to fly."},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"- Uh, no, it isn't."},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"And we will find the 20 million."},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"- Okay."},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you keep all\nthese numbers straight"},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"because there's a lot of,\nas I said, buckets of money"},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"here and there\nand everywhere and"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"some have restrictions on them,"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"some you have\nlegislative restrictions,"},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"for example if you\nwanted to get into the"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"principal of the legacy fund and"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"nobody's talking\nabout the principal"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"which is over four\nbillion dollars now?"},"757":{"dur":4,"text":"- You are right, it's\nfour billion and growing."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Dave] But you can\ntake the interest."},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"- But we can use\nthe interest and no,"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"nobody's interested in taking\nthe principal at this time."},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"- No."},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"But there are some\nthings that you can do"},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"and move some money around."},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's all well and good\nbecause you can do this."},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"- That's right and,\noh another place"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"we're gonna have some money\nin what we call our SIF fund,"},"781":{"dur":4,"text":"our strategic investment\nand improvement fund."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, oil has a little bit"},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"higher price than\nwe

didn't think"},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"we were gonna get 45\nwe were thinking 36."},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"So the price of oil\nis a little higher"},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"than anticipated and so\nwe are ending up with"},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"a little more money in\nthat particular bucket"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"or fund so that it can\nhelp us move forward."},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"- And of
