think part"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"of the problem is that there is not enough respect"},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"for the problem."},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"Also that I think we are spinning our wheels"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"when it comes for explanations for educational disparities."},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I'm going to talk a little bit"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"about where I think we should focus."},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm not going to really present any research."},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"So what is the achievement gap?"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"How big is the achievement gap?"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, what I am showing you here is achievement for Blacks,"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"whites and Hispanics in the 12th grade."},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is based on National Assessment"},"537":{"dur":0,"text":"of Educational Progress."},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is national represented data, okay, 12th graders."},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"Each test of skills with a 300 is considered proficient."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"So you see that white 12th graders are closer"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"to being proficient that black and Hispanic 12th graders"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"but in order to give you the sense"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"for the gap I am going to put up a red line."},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"And the red line represents white 8th graders."},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is 4 years' worth of growth."},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"But the other thing you will notice here is"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"that on average white 8th graders are --"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"actually black and Latino 12th graders are graduating high"},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"school with skill sets equivalent"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"to whites in the 8th grade."},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a 4 year gap."},"574":{"dur":0,"text":"On average."},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"This a different way of showing you the achievement gap."},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"This is based on NEAP data again National Assessment"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"of Educational Progress, so this is national represented data."},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"And here you are looking at the students at"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"or above basic proficiency level and I am going"},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"to highlight the bar for blacks where you see slightly more"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"than a half of blacks are proficient in reading and less"},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"that a 1\/3 are proficient at math, science and U.S. history."},"597":{"dur":4,"text":"Hispanics are not doing too much better."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"Now this is the gap over time."},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay? So here you're seeing every decade"},"607":{"dur":0,"text":"that the U.S. Department"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"of Education collects large scale data sets"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"and this allows researchers to conduct studies on education."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I am showing you the standardized gap"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"for the Equal Education Opportunity of 1965,"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"the National Longitudinal Study of '72."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"High school and beyond of 80 and 82"},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"and the National Longitudinal Study of 1992"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"and the Educational Longitude Study of 2006."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"So these are all 12th graders in those years."},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"And so because you're going across decades and, you know,"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"across different tests and different samples."},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"The gap was standardized"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"so you're seeing how the gap changes over time."},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"Well Hedges and Newel conducted a study in which they calculated"},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"that the gap at the rate of decline from '65"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"to '92 the gap was closing"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"by .126 standard deviations per decade."},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"So in other words, how many times do you have"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"to subtract this number from that number to get"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"to zero is that's how many decades it is going"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"to take to close the gap."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"So roughly 5 to 6 decades to close the gap."},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"Given the rate of decline from '65"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"to '92 absent any major intervention."},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"Here is the same information for math, 12th graders again,"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"rate of decline is .08 standard deviations,"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"so what you're seeing is it is going to take roughly 10 decades"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"for the gap to close in math."},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"Absent intervention and that's given the rate"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"of decline from 1965 to 1992."},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"So those projections are good up to '92."},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"What has happened since 1992?"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"What has happened since the mid '90's?"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"Here I am showing you the gap on perhaps the most consequential"},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"of exams the SAT '96 through 2012."},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"The scores are not important, what's important is"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"that the lines are not converging and so"},"708":{"dur":4,"text":"that convergence from 1965 to 92 has stalled and so now we see"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"that the gap is pretty much, you know, it's flat"},"715":{"dur":5,"text":"and that's reading, and there's math."},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"So essentially what I have shown you so far is"},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"that it's a 4 year gap."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"It's pretty big on an average black"},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"and Hispanic 12th graders are graduating"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"with 8th grade skill set."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"It's pervasive it stands across a wide range of subjects;"},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"reading, science, math, U.S. history."},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"You can't just focus on 1 particular subject."},"741":{"dur":5,"text":"It's persistent, it doesn't seem to be going anywhere."},"747":{"dur":5,"text":"And given this trend we haven't even begun to cut"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"into those projected declines yet so I would still say"},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"that those projections are probably still arcuate"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"in the terms of 5 decades in reading and close"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"to 10 decades in math."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"Absent any major intervention."},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"Some news that I thought was good at one point was"},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"that these lines -- so this is 2012, somewhere toward the end"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"of this right here is 2014 and these lines are going"},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"to drastically converge by 2014,"},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"and the reason why is cause the No Child Left Behind Act"},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"suggested that this was the year for the gap to close [laughter]."},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"And so when they suggested that I thought that they were aware"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"of these patterns but that there was some magic plan"},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"that they were going to unveil [laughter] that was going"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"to lead these lines to converge drastically in 1 year."},"796":{"dur":6,"text":"It just makes you think about when people think"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"about policies are they realistic?"},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"Are they aware of the data, are they connected to the data"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"and the trends and the patterns?"},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"So I've talked about the gap in terms of test scores."},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"Well here's the gap in terms of GPA."},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"What I am showing you is the average GPA"},"819":{"dur":4,"text":"for students in 2001 was 330."},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"So this zero represents 330 in 2001"},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"and whites were this much more"},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"than the national average so they are 336."},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"Right? So this is showing you how much more they"},"833":{"dur":6,"text":"above the average in 2001 and in 2011; that's whites,"},"840":{"dur":5,"text":"Asian Americans, there's Hispanics and blacks."},"846":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's a gap that shows up on standardized tests, it's the gap"},"850":{"dur":4,"text":"that shows up on GPA, teacher evaluations,"},"854":{"dur":4,"text":"so it's a real problem."},"859":{"dur":4,"text":"Now why is this perhaps I think the biggest problem facing this"},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"country this century?"},"865":{"dur":3,"text":"Here you are looking at the U.S. population percentage white"},"869":{"dur":4,"text":"and non-white in 2000, 2010 and from here"},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"on we have projections."},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"Regardless of whether you believe the projections,"},"877":{"dur":5,"text":"it's certainly clear that the country is rapidly diversifying."},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"You cannot have nearly half of your population walking"},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"around with 8th grade skill sets on average."},"889":{"dur":2,"text":"There's no way that doesn't affect everyone."},"891":{"dur":3,"text":"And so this is why I think this is a big problem and I think"},"895":{"dur":3,"text":"that when you hear politicians or superintendents say"},"898":{"dur":1,"text":"that you know, I am going"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"to close the gap in my term in office."},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, this is going to be closed within the 3 or 4 years,"},"905":{"dur":2,"text":"they don't respect the problem."},"907":{"dur":5,"text":"It's like the trying to stop a freight train with a BB gun."},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"You know you don't walk into the office of an oncologist --"},"916":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is an example I like to use --"},"917":{"dur":1,"text":"you don't walk into the office of an oncologist"},"919":{"dur":2,"text":"and say you guys have been working on cancer research"},"921":{"dur":3,"text":"for decades, millions dollars have gone into this,"},"925":{"dur":1,"text":"I want the cure by next week."},"927":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't say that because we respect that problem."},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"And so this problem warrants that same level of respect"},"933":{"dur":3,"text":"when you realize the depth of it."},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"So part of the problem is that we do have a lack of respect"},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"and people actually believe they are going to solve it within,"},"942":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, the next 5 to 10 years."},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"The other thing is that I think we are spinning our wheels."},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"So one is that there are tons of explanations"},"949":{"dur":0,"text":"that have been put forth for the gap."},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"I am going to talk about a few of the popular ones."},"953":{"dur":1,"text":"One you have is genetic deficiency."},"954":{"dur":3,"text":"This was put forward by Author Jensen a psychologist,"},"958":{"dur":3,"text":"and Hurston and Murray revived it with the publication"},"962":{"dur":1,"text":"of the Bell shaped curve."},"963":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is -- there really is not much empirical evidence"},"968":{"dur":3,"text":"to support this although there are some researchers"},"972":{"dur":6,"text":"at UNC Chapel Hill who have been doing some work on the role"},"978":{"dur":4,"text":"of genetics in predicting social behaviors."},"983":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a data set called add health"},"986":{"dur":4,"text":"that has a thousand variables and each variable corresponds"},"990":{"dur":5,"text":"to particular gene, and it is measured as 012 the absence"},"996":{"dur":2,"text":"of a gene, the presents and lord the presence"},"998":{"dur":0,"text":"for sure of the gene."},"999":{"dur":6,"text":"And it's only a matter of time before I think that it starts"},"1005":{"dur":1,"text":"to get linked to achievement."},"1007":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a clumsy way of --"},"1010":{"dur":1,"text":"it's what happens when social scientist try"},"1012":{"dur":3,"text":"to play geneticists but never the less I like to think"},"1015":{"dur":3,"text":"that it is not taken serious anymore but I can't really say"},"1018":{"dur":2,"text":"that knowing that there some scholars out there"},"1021":{"dur":2,"text":"that are still kind of thinking in this direction."},"1024":{"dur":4,"text":"The next thing is that there are differences in school resources,"},"1028":{"dur":4,"text":"in family structure or family social economic status."},"1033":{"dur":3,"text":"And this explanation is one that, you know,"},"1036":{"dur":6,"text":"we have all heard various variations of this."},"1042":{"dur":2,"text":"The gap still exists when you control"},"1045":{"dur":3,"text":"for social economic back ground factors."},"1048":{"dur":3,"text":"What that means is to give a brief a really, really quick,"},"1052":{"dur":5,"text":"what I mean by control for is when you equalize"},"1058":{"dur":4,"text":"on characteristics that's where you're controlling."},"1062":{"dur":3,"text":"So an example I give because I'm going to --"},"1066":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm a friendly quantitative researcher so often times going"},"1070":{"dur":2,"text":"to let's say you have an achievement gap in this room"},"1073":{"dur":4,"text":"and women are out preforming the males let's just say."},"1077":{"dur":3,"text":"And you realize that the women are sitting closer to the board,"},"1080":{"dur":2,"text":"the average distance for the women is closer."},"1083":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, we could say let's control the seating arrangement and so"},"1086":{"dur":1,"text":"if you randomize so now the average distance"},"1088":{"dur":3,"text":"from the board is the same for the males and the

that is beyond socioeconomic status,"},"2133":{"dur":4,"text":"it's beyond stereotyping, it's difficult"},"2137":{"dur":1,"text":"to really gage discrimination."},"2138":{"dur":3,"text":"I would say

Americans or Latinos the very first paragraph"},"2159":{"dur":4,"text":"of those papers is going to say blacks do less well in school"},"2164":{"dur":3,"text":"than whites, Latinos do less well in school than whites."},"2167":{"dur":3,"text":"There is an achievement gap that has persisted over time."},"2171":{"dur":2,"text":"And yet when you actually look at the research what you find is"},"2173":{"dur":2,"text":"that they are not race comparative at all."},"2175":{"dur":2,"text":"But you're saying oh the racial identity predicts achievement"},"2178":{"dur":1,"text":"for African Americans."},"2180":{"dur":3,"text":"Or maybe that parent involvement predicts achievement"},"2184":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think that one of the things that has happened"},"2187":{"dur":2,"text":"in psychology in particular is"},"2189":{"dur":3,"text":"that we have problematized African American and Latinos"},"2192":{"dur":3,"text":"and we begin every debate about black and Latinos"},"2196":{"dur":4,"text":"from the prospective of this deficit or difference."},"2200":{"dur":4,"text":"So I've had colleagues actually and others say to me,"},"2204":{"dur":2,"text":"\"But how you can talk about black people without talking"},"2207":{"dur":1,"text":"about the achievement gap?\""},"2208":{"dur":3,"text":"You can't talk about how well black students do in

is where they want to start,"},"2225":{"dur":4,"text":"and to me the real elephant in the room is why don't we talk"},"2229":{"dur":4,"text":"about that Asian\/white gap that Angel had on the slides."},"2233":{"dur":2,"text":"Why are we not concerned about the poor performance"},"2236":{"dur":3,"text":"of white students in the United States and why is ti"},"2239":{"dur":2,"text":"that when

that."},"2245":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know but I think that there is something in the way"},"2247":{"dur":3,"text":"that we frame the achievement gap even the very term"},"2251":{"dur":6,"text":"that begins at this place of deficit, of vulnerability,"},"2257":{"dur":2,"text":"of pathology, etcetera."},"2260":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think that then purveys the

today."},"2305":{"dur":3,"text":"But my point was that in reading that article what I noticed was"},"2309":{"dur":2,"text":"that the way they were talking about the achievement gap"},"2312":{"dur":2,"text":"and the way that the local schools are trying"},"2314":{"dur":3,"text":"to address this was through addressing the children."},"2318":{"dur":3,"text":"That is they were

we problematize the child rather than the school."},"2336":{"dur":3,"text":"So who said what can we do to the school context"},"2339":{"dur":1,"text":"that would change things?"},"2341":{"dur":2,"text":"And in fact there are a number of achievement gap interventions"},"2343":{"dur":2,"text":"that have been really successful in North Carolina for

visit a gifted classroom"},"2358":{"dur":2,"text":"where they didn't have test scores that were high enough"},"2360":{"dur":2,"text":"to get into gifted programs"},"2362":{"dur":2,"text":"but they were allowed to visit for a year."},"2364":{"dur":3,"text":"So at the end of the year they retested these kids"},"2367":{"dur":1,"text":"who were visiting and low"},"2369":{"dur":2,"text":"and behold their test scores were high enough for them"},"2371":{"dur":2,"text":"to legitimately be in the class."},"2373":{"dur":1,"text":"Well what happens?"},"2375":{"dur":2,"text":"You put a kid in a classroom with the best teacher"},"2377":{"dur":2,"text":"in the school, with the best students in the school,"},"2380":{"dur":1,"text":"with the most rigorous curriculum"},"2381":{"dur":2,"text":"in the school and they flourish."},"2383":{"dur":1,"text":"But instead what we often want"},"2385":{"dur":1,"text":"to do is segregate these children"},"2386":{"dur":3,"text":"in special education programs, special tutoring"},"2390":{"dur":1,"text":"and special this that and the other and we don't think"},"2392":{"dur":1,"text":"about the larger context."},"2394":{"dur":2,"text":"And so my first point is really that we need to think"},"2397":{"dur":3,"text":"about how indeed we are framing the problem, the achievement gap"},"2400":{"dur":1,"text":"and where we locate the problem."},"2402":{"dur":3,"text":"So I in one of my own studies that came out of this --"},"2406":{"dur":3,"text":"so I wrote a small grant in response to thinking about this"},"2410":{"dur":2,"text":"and I said what do parents and kids think?"},"2413":{"dur":2,"text":"So as a black parent when I send my kid"},"2415":{"dur":1,"text":"to school every day am I thinking"},"2417":{"dur":3,"text":"that I am sending him off to be part of the gap [laughter]?"},"2420":{"dur":1,"text":"You know kind of."},"2421":{"dur":1,"text":"And what happens to parents when they do that?"},"2423":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what we did is we interviewed black"},"2426":{"dur":4,"text":"and Latino parents and their kids and we gave them this story"},"2430":{"dur":1,"text":"about the achievement gap about half of them read"},"2432":{"dur":0,"text":"above the achievement gap."},"2433":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we asked the parents after reading the story"},"2436":{"dur":3,"text":"to help their kids on like a math homework type task."},"2439":{"dur":3,"text":"And we played it up like it was really difficult"},"2442":{"dur":2,"text":"and even the parents who weren't in the priming group were told"},"2445":{"dur":2,"text":"that school is hard and the task is hard and things like that."},"2448":{"dur":3,"text":"And what we found in those parents who were reminded"},"2452":{"dur":2,"text":"of the achievement gap before they helped their kids was"},"2454":{"dur":2,"text":"that these parents were more intrusive"},"2457":{"dur":1,"text":"so when they helped their kids"},"2458":{"dur":2,"text":"with the task they were more likely to take the task"},"2460":{"dur":2,"text":"over for their child, you know, the autonomy is really important"},"2463":{"dur":2,"text":"for kids at this age these are middle school kids."},"2465":{"dur":1,"text":"We found that they were more negative"},"2467":{"dur":1,"text":"and anxious during the task"},"2468":{"dur":2,"text":"and they were less supportive of their kids."},"2471":{"dur":2,"text":"So our interpretation is that the framing"},"2474":{"dur":3,"text":"of the achievement gap, the constant reminders in the minds"},"2477":{"dur":3,"text":"of parents, and teachers, and kids are then leading parents"},"2480":{"dur":2,"text":"to potentially maladaptive parenting."},"2483":{"dur":3,"text":"So you're not allowing your kids to explore things on their own"},"2486":{"dur":4,"text":"because you're so nervous about how they are going to preform,"},"2491":{"dur":2,"text":"and of course this is going to trickle down tot the kids"},"2493":{"dur":3,"text":"and about how they feel about themselves."},"2496":{"dur":5,"text":"Obviously we know this is also effecting teachers as well."},"2502":{"dur":5,"text":"So I think that this deficit approach also influences the"},"2507":{"dur":2,"text":"kinds of questions that we undertake."},"2510":{"dur":3,"text":"Another one of my colleagues John Haggen did a study"},"2513":{"dur":2,"text":"of the outlets -- the top outlets"},"2515":{"dur":3,"text":"for adolescent research in psychology."},"2518":{"dur":2,"text":"And he gathered all of the articles from these journals"},"2521":{"dur":3,"text":"from a period of

youth?"},"2531":{"dur":3,"text":"The studies of white and Asian students, of white"},"2534":{"dur":2,"text":"and Asian youth were primarily normative."},"2537":{"dur":3,"text":"So how does their life unfold over time?"},"2540":{"dur":4,"text":"And so of course we're beginning to get to this point"},"2544":{"dur":2,"text":"where a child comes into the classroom"},"2546":{"dur":2,"text":"and the teacher can tell by looking at them"},"2549":{"dur":2,"text":"that they are a problem because they are a part"},"2551":{"dur":1,"text":"of a particular group."},"2553":{"dur":3,"text":"And we know from studies of young teachers in particular"},"2556":{"dur":2,"text":"that they are heavily swayed by these stereotypes again"},"2559":{"dur":3,"text":"as Angel pointed out simply by looking at

ability"},"2580":{"dur":2,"text":"to move within that space."},"2583":{"dur":3,"text":"So this brings me to my second thought is that we need"},"2586":{"dur":3,"text":"to move outside of the box of just thinking"},"2590":{"dur":4,"text":"about what's happening academically in the classroom"},"2594":{"dur":1,"text":"and think about some nonacademic things"},"2596":{"dur":2,"text":"that are effecting children down the line"},"2598":{"dur":1,"text":"that effect performance."},"2600":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the big things I have been thinking about a lot"},"2602":{"dur":3,"text":"for the past several years is the school to prison pipeline"},"2605":{"dur":0,"text":"and the fact that black"},"2606":{"dur":4,"text":"and Latino youth are much more likely to end up

cases."},"2619":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what is happening is the ACLU has put together a lot"},"2623":{"dur":2,"text":"of really wonderful resources on the topic"},"2625":{"dur":3,"text":"and what's happening is a black child engages"},"2629":{"dur":2,"text":"in the same behavior as a white child"},"2631":{"dur":1,"text":"and the black child is more likely"},"2633":{"dur":1,"text":"to be suspended or expelled."},"2635":{"dur":3,"text":"The other thing is African American children are more"},"2638":{"dur":4,"text":"likely to be suspended for what I call \"soft offences\","},"2642":{"dur":3,"text":"things like being disrespectful to the teacher or disruptive"},"2645":{"dur":3,"text":"to the class where as white students are more likely"},"2648":{"dur":3,"text":"to be suspended or expelled for more concrete offences"},"2651":{"dur":4,"text":"like smoking or bringing drugs to school, etcetera."},"2656":{"dur":1,"text":"So that

students."},"2665":{"dur":3,"text":"So the psychological issue is here is that what then happens"},"2668":{"dur":1,"text":"to the student who was suspended?"},"2670":{"dur":2,"text":"So you go home for like 2 weeks."},"2672":{"dur":3,"text":"My son had a friend who was suspended in the 6th grade"},"2676":{"dur":2,"text":"for sending an inappropriate note to a girl."},"2679":{"dur":2,"text":"He

work."},"2693":{"dur":2,"text":"He's at home by himself for like 14 days."},"2695":{"dur":2,"text":"So do you think he got his homework?"},"2697":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you think he was missing out on instruction"},"2700":{"dur":2,"text":"and then psychologically what happens to him"},"2703":{"dur":1,"text":"as he returns to school?"},"2705":{"dur":3,"text":"So he comes back to school and his

checks out or he engages in further misbehavior."},"2723":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I think this is a serious problem"},"2726":{"dur":4,"text":"because again the disparity in disciplinary action is

about psychologists is the issue"},"2740":{"dur":2,"text":"of physical health and wellbeing."},"2743":{"dur":2,"text":"So we know that African Americans children"},"2745":{"dur":5,"text":"in

the classroom, less preparation for school,"},"2805":{"dur":1,"text":"you're less likely do your homework"},"2807":{"dur":3,"text":"and of course your sleepy all day so it is causing

literature"},"2816":{"dur":1,"text":"on things like racial discrimination what we are"},"2818":{"dur":3,"text":"finding is that there's lots of connections to psychophysiology"},"2821":{"dur":1,"text":"and these physical kinds of outcomes."},"2823":{"dur":2,"text":"We are thinking about these less I think in the lives of

are only relevant at certain times."},"2864":{"dur":2,"text":"Although identity related processes are probably most"},"2866":{"dur":1,"text":"explained -- so I didn't' talk about the whole

2003."},"2949":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, you know, we have to think"},"2952":{"dur":5,"text":"about how these interventions are also causing unexpected"},"2957":{"dur":1,"text":"negative

at."},"3061":{"dur":3,"text":"Precisely why that should be is very puzzling."},"3064":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that something that we have not talked about today"},"3067":{"dur":1,"text":"and something I have been hearing about more"},"3068":{"dur":3,"text":"and more is the possibility that the gaps might differ"},"3071":{"dur":4,"text":"by gender among blacks, which if true I don't know
