are the questions that fascinate me."},"31":{"dur":2,"text":"(Cheers) (Applause)"},"35":{"dur":3,"text":"So brain research\nis one of the great frontiers"},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"in the understanding of human physiology,"},"41":{"dur":4,"text":"and also in the consideration\nof what makes us who we are."},"45":{"dur":2,"text":"It's an amazing time\nto be a brain researcher,"},"47":{"dur":1,"text":"and I would argue to you"},"49":{"dur":2,"text":"that I have the most interesting job\nin the world."},"52":{"dur":3,"text":"What we know about the brain\nis changing at a breathtaking pace."},"56":{"dur":3,"text":"And much of what we thought we knew\nand understood about the brain"},"59":{"dur":3,"text":"turns out to be not true or incomplete."},"63":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of these misconceptions\nare more obvious than others."},"66":{"dur":2,"text":"For example, we used to think"},"69":{"dur":4,"text":"that after childhood the brain did not,\nreally could not change."},"74":{"dur":3,"text":"And it turns out that nothing\ncould be farther from the truth."},"78":{"dur":1,"text":"Another misconception about the brain"},"79":{"dur":3,"text":"is that you only use parts of it\nat any given time"},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's silent when you do nothing."},"85":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, this is also untrue."},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"It turns out\nthat even when you're at a rest"},"89":{"dur":3,"text":"and thinking of nothing,\nyour brain is highly active."},"93":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's been advances\nin technology, such as MRI,"},"97":{"dur":3,"text":"that's allowed us to make these\nand many other important discoveries."},"100":{"dur":1,"text":"And perhaps the most exciting,"},"102":{"dur":3,"text":"the most interesting\nand transformative of these discoveries"},"105":{"dur":3,"text":"is that, every time you learn\na new fact or skill,"},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"you change your brain."},"111":{"dur":2,"text":"It's something we call neuroplasticity."},"114":{"dur":4,"text":"So as little as 25 years ago,\nwe thought that after about puberty,"},"118":{"dur":3,"text":"the only changes that took place\nin the brain were negative:"},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"the loss of brain cells with aging,"},"123":{"dur":2,"text":"the result of damage, like a stroke."},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, studies began\nto show remarkable amounts"},"129":{"dur":3,"text":"of reorganization in the adult brain."},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"And the ensuing research has shown us"},"135":{"dur":3,"text":"that all of our behaviors\nchange our brain."},"139":{"dur":3,"text":"That these changes are not limited by age,"},"143":{"dur":1,"text":"it's a good news right?"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"And in fact,\nthey are taking place all the time."},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"And very importantly,"},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"brain reorganization helps\nto support recovery"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"after you damage your brain."},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"The key to each of these changes\nis neuroplasticity."},"159":{"dur":1,"text":"So what does it look like?"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"So your brain can change\nin three very basic ways"},"164":{"dur":1,"text":"to support learning."},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"And the first is chemical."},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"So your brain actually functions\nby transferring chemicals signals"},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"between brain cells,\nwhat we call neurons,"},"173":{"dur":3,"text":"and this triggered a series\nof actions and reactions."},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"So to support learning,\nyour brain can increase the amount"},"180":{"dur":3,"text":"or the concentrations\nof these chemical signaling"},"183":{"dur":3,"text":"that's taking place between neurons."},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"Because this change can happen rapidly,"},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"this supports short-term memory"},"190":{"dur":4,"text":"or the short-term improvement\nin the performance of a motor skill."},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"The second way that the brain\ncan change to support learning"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"is by altering its structure."},"201":{"dur":4,"text":"So during learning, the brain can change\nthe connections between neurons."},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"Here, the physical structure\nof the brain is actually changing"},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"so this takes a bit more time."},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"These type of changes are related\nto long-term memory,"},"213":{"dur":3,"text":"the long-term improvement\nin a motor skill."},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"These processes interact,\nand let me give you an example of how."},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"We've all tried to learn\na new motor skill,"},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe playing the piano,"},"226":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe learning to juggle."},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"You've had the experience\nof getting better and better"},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"within a single session of practice,"},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"and thinking \"I have got it.\""},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, maybe you return the next day,"},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"and all those improvements\nfrom the day before are lost."},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"What happened?"},"242":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, in the short-term,\nyour brain was able to increase"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"the chemical signaling\nbetween your neurons."},"248":{"dur":4,"text":"But for some reason, those changes\ndid not induce the structural changes"},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"that are necessary\nto support long-term memory."},"257":{"dur":3,"text":"Remember that\nlong-term memories take time."},"260":{"dur":3,"text":"And what you see in the short term\ndoes not reflect learning,"},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"It's these physical changes"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"that are now going to support\nlong-term memories,"},"267":{"dur":3,"text":"and chemical changes\nthat support short-term memories."},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"Structural changes also can lead\nto integrated networks of brain regions"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"that function together\nto support learning."},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"And they can also lead\nto certain brain regions"},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"that are important\nfor very specific behaviors"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"to change your structure or to enlarge."},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"So here's some examples of that."},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"People who read Braille"},"291":{"dur":5,"text":"have larger hand sensory areas\nin their brain than those of us who don't."},"296":{"dur":4,"text":"Your dominant hand motor region,\nwhich is on the left side of your brain,"},"300":{"dur":3,"text":"if you are right-handed,\nis larger than the other side."},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"And research shows\nthe London taxi cab drivers"},"307":{"dur":4,"text":"who actually have to memorize a map\nof London to get their taxi cab license,"},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"they have larger brain regions devoted\nto spatial, or mapping memories."},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"The last way that your brain\ncan change to support learning"},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"is by altering its function."},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"As you use a brain region,"},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"It becomes more and more excitable\nand easy to use again."},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"And as your brain has these areas\nthat increase their excitability,"},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"the brain shifts\nhow and when they are activated."},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"With learning, we see"},"337":{"dur":4,"text":"that whole networks of brain activity\nare shifting and changing."},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"So neuroplasticity is supported"},"344":{"dur":4,"text":"by chemical, by structural,\nand by functional changes,"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"and these are happening\nacross the whole brain."},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"They can occur in isolation\nfrom one or another,"},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"but most often,\nthey take place in concert."},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"Together, they support learning."},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"And they're taking place all the time."},"364":{"dur":4,"text":"I just told you really\nhow awesomely neuroplastic your brain is."},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"Why can't you learn anything\nyou choose to with ease?"},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"Why do our kids sometimes fail in school?"},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"Why as we age\ndo we tend to forget things?"},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"And why don't people fully recover\nfrom brain damage?"},"383":{"dur":5,"text":"That is: what is it that limits\nand facilitates neuroplasticity?"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"And so this is what I study."},"391":{"dur":4,"text":"I study specifically how it relates\nto recovery from stroke."},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"Recently, stroke dropped"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"from being the third leading cause\nof death in the United States"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"to be the forth leading cause\nof death."},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"Great news, right?"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"But actually, it turns out"},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"that the number of people\nhaving a stroke has not declined."},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"We are just better at keeping\npeople alive after a severe stroke."},"413":{"dur":4,"text":"It turns out to be very difficult\nto help the brain recover from stroke."},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"And frankly,"},"419":{"dur":4,"text":"we have failed to develop\neffective rehabilitation interventions."},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"The net result of this\nis that stroke is the leading cause"},"429":{"dur":4,"text":"of long-term disability\nin adults in the world;"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"individuals with stroke are younger"},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"and tending to live longer\nwith that disability,"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"and research from my group actually shows"},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"that the health-related quality of life\nof Canadians with stroke has declined."},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"So clearly we need to be better"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"at helping people recover from stroke."},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"This is an enormous societal problem,"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's one that we are not solving."},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"So what can be done?"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"One thing is absolutely clear:"},"461":{"dur":4,"text":"the best driver of neuroplastic change\nin your brain is your behavior."},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"The problem is that the dose\nof behavior, the dose of practice"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"that's required to learn\nnew and relearn old motor skills,"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"is very large."},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"And how to effectively deliver\nthese large doses of practice"},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"is a very difficult problem;\nIt's also a very expensive problem."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"So the approach\nthat my research has taken"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"is to develop therapies that prime\nor that prepare the brain to learn."},"489":{"dur":4,"text":"And these have included brain simulation,\nexercise, and robotics."},"494":{"dur":3,"text":"But through my research,\nI've realized that a major limitation"},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"to the development of therapies\nthat speed recovery from stroke"},"501":{"dur":5,"text":"is that patterns of neuroplasticity\nare highly variable from person to person."},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"As a researcher,\nvariability used to drive me crazy."},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"It makes it very difficult\nto use the statistics"},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"to test your data and your ideas."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"And because of this,\nmedical intervention studies are"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"specifically designed\nto minimize variability."},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"But in my research,\nit's becoming really clear"},"528":{"dur":4,"text":"that the most important,\nthe most informative data we collect"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"is showing this variability."},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"So by studying the brain\nafter stroke, we've learned a lot,"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"and I think these lessons\nare very valuable in other areas."},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"The first lesson is"},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"that the primary driver of change\nin your brain is your behavior,"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"so there is no neuroplasticity drug\nyou can take."},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"Nothing is more effective than practice\nat helping you learn,"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"and the bottom line\nis you have to do the work."},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"And in fact, my research has shown"},"565":{"dur":5,"text":"increased difficulty, increased struggle\nif you will, during practice,"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"actually leads to both more learning,"},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"and greater structural change\nin the brain."},"577":{"dur":4,"text":"The problem here is that neuroplastcity\ncan work both ways."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"It can be positive,\nyou learn something new,"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"and you refine a motor skill."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"And it also can be negative though,\nyou forgot something you once knew,"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"you become addicted to drugs,"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe you have chronic pain."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"So your brain is tremendously plastic,"},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"and it's been shaped both structurally\nand functionally by everything you do,"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"but also by everything that you don't do."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"The second lesson\nwe've learned about the brain"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"is that there is\nno one-size-fits-all approach to learning."},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"So there is no recipe for learning."},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"Consider the popular belief\nthat it takes 10,000 hours of practice"},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"to learn and to master a new motor skill."},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"I can assure you\nit's not quite that simple."},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"For some of us,"},"628":{"dur":4,"text":"it's going to take a lot more practice,\nand for others it may take far less."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"So the shaping of our plastic brains\nis far too unique"},"636":{"dur":4,"text":"for there to be any single intervention\nthat's going to work for all of us."},"641":{"dur":5,"text":"This realization has forced us to consider\nsomething call personalized medicine."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the idea that to optimize outcomes"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"each individual requires\ntheir own intervention."},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"And the idea actually comes\nfrom cancer treatments."},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"And here it turns out that genetics\nare very important in matching"},"659":{"dur":4,"text":"certain types of chemotherapy\nwith specific forms of cancer."},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"My research is showing that this\nalso applies to recovery from stroke."},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"There're certain characteristics\nof brain structure and function"},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"we called biomarkers."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"And these biomarkers\nare proving to be very helpful"},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"and helping us to match"},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"specific therapies\nwith individual patients."},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"The data from my lab suggests\nit's a combination of biomarkers"},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"that best predicts neuroplastic change\nand patterns of recovery after stroke."},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's not surprising, given\nhow complicated the human brain is."},"694":{"dur":4,"text":"But I also think we can consider\nthis concept much more broadly."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"Given the unique structure\nand function of each of our brains"},"703":{"dur":5,"text":"what we've learned about neuroplasticity\nafter stroke applies to everyone."},"710":{"dur":4,"text":"Behaviors that you employ\nin your everyday life are important."},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"Each of them is changing your brain."},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"And I believe we have to consider"},"719":{"dur":4,"text":"not just personalized medicine\nbut personalized learning."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"The uniqueness\nof your brain will affect you"},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"both as a learner and also as a teacher."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"This idea helps us to understand"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"why some children can thrive\nin tradition education settings"},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"and others don't;"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"why some of us can learn languages easily"},"739":{"dur":4,"text":"and yet, others can pick up\nany sport and excel."},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"So when you leave this room today,"},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"your brain will not be the same\nas when you entered this morning."},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that's pretty amazing."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"But each of you is going to have changed\nyour brain differently."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"Understanding these differences,"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"these individual patterns,\nthis variability and change"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"is going to enable\nthe next great advance in neuroscience;"},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"it's going to allow us to develop\nnew and more effective interventions,"},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"and allow for matches\nbetween learners and teachers,"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"and patients and interventions."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"And this does not just apply\nthe recovery from stroke,"},"783":{"dur":4,"text":"it applies to each of us, as a parent,\nas a teacher, as a manager,"},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"and also because you are\nat TEDx today, as a lifelong learner."},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"Study how and what you learn best."},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"Repeat those behaviors\nthat are healthy for your brain,"},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"and break those behaviors\nand habits that are not."},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"Practice."},"806":{"dur":4,"text":"Learning is about doing the work\nthat your brain requires."},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"So the best strategies\nare going to vary between individuals."},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"You know what, they're even going\nto vary within individuals."},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"So for you, learning music\nmay come very easily,"},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"but learning to snowboard, much harder."},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"I hope that you leave today"},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"with a new appreciation\nof how magnificent your brain is."},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"You and your plastic brain are constantly\nbeing shaped by the world around you."},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"Understand that everything you do,"},"837":{"dur":4,"text":"everything you encounter, and everything\nyou experience is changing your brain."},"841":{"dur":4,"text":"And that can be for better,\nbut it can also be for worse."},"845":{"dur":4,"text":"So when you leave today,\ngo out and build the brain you want."},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you very much."},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"(Applause)"}}
