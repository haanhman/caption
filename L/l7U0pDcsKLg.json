Um"},"47":{"dur":3,"text":"weaponizing data sites through\nsocial engineering automated end"},"51":{"dur":3,"text":"to end spoof phishing on\nTwitter. So uh we think this"},"54":{"dur":2,"text":"talk is actually pretty good fit\nfor this conference right? Every"},"57":{"dur":4,"text":"year uh Black Hat you know does\nthis attendee survey and every"},"62":{"dur":3,"text":"year social media you know\nphishing spear phishing social"},"65":{"dur":5,"text":"engineering is near the top of\ntheir lists of concerns. Um we"},"70":{"dur":2,"text":"wanted to try our hand and see\nhow effective using AI to"},"73":{"dur":4,"text":"actually automate spear phishing\nwould be. And so uh things like"},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"social engineering took it\nactually automates the backend"},"81":{"dur":3,"text":"of uh you know social\nengineering right? So da uh"},"84":{"dur":2,"text":"creating a malicious payload.\nThings like that. We're actually"},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"interested in more of the front\nend sort of stuff. So actually"},"89":{"dur":4,"text":"generating links that users will\nclick. Um traditionally there"},"93":{"dur":2,"text":"are two different types of\napproaches to this. There's"},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"phishing which is very low\neffort you know shotgunning tons"},"99":{"dur":3,"text":"and tons of messages. But it\nalso has very very low success."},"102":{"dur":4,"text":"Between like 5 and 14 percent.\nUm there's also spear phishing"},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"which is highly manual. It takes\nlike tens of minutes to actually"},"109":{"dur":3,"text":"research a target and create a\nmessage that's you know uh um"},"113":{"dur":5,"text":"hand crafted to that actual\nperson.

It's been"},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"around for a really long time.\nOne of the kind of uh"},"204":{"dur":4,"text":"fundamental examples happened\nover 50 years ago with the Eliza"},"208":{"dur":4,"text":"chat box. So this was a this was\ndesigned by psycho therapist"},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"named Joseph Wiezenbaum. MIT.\nAnd he used it in a very"},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"clinical setting. So he wanted\nto try to have his patients who"},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"were either on their death bed\nor close to death um be able to"},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"interact in some way with a with\na computer. So it was very kind"},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"of naive very ad hoc um it was\nbased on parsing the keyword"},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"replacement. It would it would\nsimply do something like give"},"233":{"dur":3,"text":"the input to the program was my\nhead hurts. Uh it would output"},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"something in response like why\ndo you say your head hurts? Or"},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"how bad does your head hurt? So\nsomething like this. Uh and"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"these kind of very early\nexamples were uh inspiring for"},"247":{"dur":3,"text":"people uh because they they\npassed some very simple versions"},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"of the Turin test right? So um\nusing these kinds of questions"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"and this very ad hoc feedback\ngoes was able to uh um not"},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"really or or fool people into\nbelieving that they might be"},"260":{"dur":4,"text":"talking to a human rather than a\nmachine. Fast forward 50 years"},"264":{"dur":4,"text":"and we have Microsoft AI which\ncame out with a neuro-network"},"268":{"dur":4,"text":"that was based uh or it was\ncalled Tay Tay and You. Um and"},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"so if you've seen this in the re\nin the news recently it was kind"},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"of a dynamically learning bot\nthat was released on Twitter. Uh"},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"and it was a really cool idea.\nSo each time a user a Twitter"},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"user tweeted at it it would kind\nof learn from that tweet. Uh and"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"then reply to it. It was a chat\nbot. And you see this a lot"},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"popping up now in Facebook and\nother kind of social media"},"292":{"dur":4,"text":"services uh for more of like a\nmarketing twist. But uh what"},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"they didn't foresee was the fact\nthat Twitter tends to be a"},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"cesspool sometimes. And tends to\nbe filled with porn and sexually"},"303":{"dur":4,"text":"explicit content and overall\nkind of [laugh] bad stuff. So uh"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"what it actually turned in to\nwas a porn written race uh"},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"racists nazi bot. And it turned\ninto quite a like a [laughter]"},"313":{"dur":5,"text":"PR disaster for Microsoft. And\nthey had to shut it down. Um so"},"319":{"dur":4,"text":"indeed we view info second\nmachine learning um as kind of"},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"prioritizing the defensive\norientation right? So um you"},"328":{"dur":4,"text":"setup perimeter or you try to\ndetect incoming threats um or"},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"you try to remediate it once\nit's already happened. The"},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"adversary has to do something in\norder for you to react to it."},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"And defend your network or\nwhatever it may be. Um so you"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"have some examples here. These\nare historical Black Hat talks"},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"over the last 10 or 15 years .\nUm you have some machine"},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"learning talks. One or two per\nyear usually. Um and they cover"},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"anything from spam filtering to\nbot net identification to"},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"network defense to intrusion\ndetection. Um but what we wanted"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"to [indiscernible] to propose\nhere was rather that you could"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"use artificial intelligence\ntechniques um and machine"},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"learning not only on defense but\nyou can use data to drive an"},"367":{"dur":4,"text":"offensive capability. Uh we call\nour tool Snapper. Um it's the"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"Social Network Automated\nPhishing and Reconnaissance"},"374":{"dur":4,"text":"tool. And it's split up into 2\nseparate phases. The first phase"},"379":{"dur":5,"text":"takes as input a set of users\nwho you want to target. Um and"},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"it takes this set of users and\nextracts a subset of them that"},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"it deems as high value targets.\nSo it prioritizes them. We'll"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"get in to more about this later.\nUh and then the second phase of"},"394":{"dur":4,"text":"the tool takes those users and\ncrafts a Tweet uh directed at"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"them based on the content that\nthey have on their historical"},"401":{"dur":4,"text":"Twitter timeline. Um and the end\nresult of this is a Tweet with"},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"an at mention and the crafted um\nmachine generated text and then"},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"a shortened link which we\nmeasure uh success using click"},"413":{"dur":5,"text":"through rates. Um so with that\nif uh if anyone wants to partake"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"in the demo we're going to do\nlater on in the talk please"},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"tweet at the hash tag snapper.\nAnd that's hash tag s n a p"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"underscore r. Um we're not going\nto target you with any kind of"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"malicious payload. It'll be a\nshortened link that just"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"redirects to Google dot commers\nand like that. Um but if you"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"want to have your timeline read\ndynamically and then have a"},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"tweet spit back out at you uh\nplease do that in the next 20 or"},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"25 minutes. Uh so the talk will\ngo I'll I'll hand it off to John"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"to talk about machine learning\nand offense and then we'll go"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"into the 2 parts of the tool\ntarget discovery and spear"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"phishing and talk in more detail\nabout how to generate the"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"message content. That's kind of\nthe core of the tool. And then"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"we'll talk about how we evalue\nthe tool and that evaluation"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"compares to other techniques uh\nthat have been found in the"},"461":{"dur":5,"text":"literature. [pause - mic sounds]\n>> Alright cool. Um so the first"},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"question is like so why is\nsocial media such a great place"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"for spear phishing people?\nRight? Why Twitter in"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"particular? Um there's a lot of\nanswers to this and we put a few"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"on this slide. Uh first thing it\na lot of these social networks"},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"have very bot friendly APIs.\nRight? Um whenever you post"},"483":{"dur":5,"text":"something on Twitter um then uh\num people can go and scrape your"},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"timeline your activity records\nthings like that very easily."},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"Because they are python uh APIs\nfor all the social networks just"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"straight up available. Another\nthing is there's a very"},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"colloquial syntax on Twitter and\nsocial networks. Um for example"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"uh when when [indiscernible]\nactually posted this tweet I"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"really quick snapped her and\nsaid hey can we use this for our"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"talk? Uh 20 years ago you\nwouldn't have any idea what this"},"511":{"dur":6,"text":"meant. Um so the idea here is\nlike basically machine lea"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"learning tools especially\ngenerative models tend to be"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"pretty bad. If you've ever seen\nlike [indiscernible] simulator"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"and things like that. Um but the\nfact is that the bar on Twitter"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"is so low to have a good you\nknow tweet uh that people will"},"530":{"dur":4,"text":"be interested in. Um even even\ngenerative models can do pretty"},"535":{"dur":4,"text":"freaking well. Um some other\nthings are like due to character"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"limits. Uh there are a lot of\nshortened links on Twitter. I"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"don't know if you've ever used\nit. Um so basically if you're"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"trying to obfuscate a payload or\nsomething like that um people"},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"don't actually think twice about\nclicking links on Twitter. You"},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"know that are that are\nshortened. Right? Because"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"everything's actually shortened\nthere. Um then there's also the"},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"fact that like people sort of\nseem to understand even now or"},"554":{"dur":4,"text":"at least some people do at this\npoint. Um like Nigerian prince"},"558":{"dur":6,"text":"scams. You know things like\nthat. Uh a lot of people"},"564":{"dur":5,"text":"actually like can tell you hey\nyou know you get an email check"},"571":{"dur":4,"text":"the link before you click. Um on\nTwitter and social media you"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"know social networks people\ndon't actually think about what"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"they click on. You know it's\nit's you don't have that sort of"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"years of awareness built up yet.\nAnd that's one of the things"},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"we're trying to actually bring\nabout with this talk. And then"},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"finally um people actually want\nto share content on these social"},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"media you know networks. Right?\nUm for example Reddit like you"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"want to get up votes. Twitter\nyou want people to share and"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"like your content. Right? So\nthere's sort of this idea of"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"like incentivizing data\ndisclosure. Um if you're you"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"know um on Twitter you're\nsharing a lot of personal"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"information about yourself about\nthings that you like things that"},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"you enjoy that can all be used\nagainst you. So we wanted to"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"give a quick shout out actually\num at SchmooCon there's a really"},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"really cool talk about uh you\nknow phishing the phishers using"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"mark off trains. And that was\nactually a huge inspiration for"},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"this talk. So we just wanted to\ngive a quick shout out. But"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"getting right in to the tool\nitself um basically there's some"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"things built in to the tool\ndirectly. And there's some"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"things that we also add on top\nof the tool. Right? So things"},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"that the tool does directly are\nit pre-pens tweets with an app"},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"mention. And on Twitter this\nactually changes what the tweets"},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"are categorized in their uh in\ntheir process. Right? Um tweets"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"that start with an app mention\nare called replies. And only"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"people who follow both the\nperson tweeting and the target"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"can actually see those tweets.\nSo if our bot doesn't have any"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"followers that means the only\nperson who can see the tweet is"},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"the target self. Which actually\nis is very useful in determining"},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"whether or not an individual you\nknow target has clicked. Um"},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"another thing that's actually\nbuilt into the tool is it"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"shortens the payload uniquely\nper user. And we'll get into"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"that in a bit. Um so that way we\ncan actually go through and each"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"of our shortened links that we\ngenerate we can check whether or"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"not that particular link was\nclicked and map that back to the"},"686":{"dur":5,"text":"user who clicked it. Also uh we\ntriage users with respect to"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"value and engagement. So we have\na machine learning model that"},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"we'll talk about in a bit. That\nactually goes first before it"},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"actually phishes the person uh\nchecks to see whether or not"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"they're a valuable target.\nWhether they interact a lot with"},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"the platform for example. Um a\none reason this is useful is for"},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"example a lot of people have\nwhats know as egg profiles or"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"profiles where they haven't\nchanged the default settings."},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"These people tend not to post a\nlot. They don't they're not very"},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"engaged. And we don't want to uh\nwaste API requests or you know"},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"waste like possible um awareness\nof the bot. Right? By trying to"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"phish these people. Um so we\njust go ahead and actually"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"triage these users out so that\nwe don't have to worry about"},"730":{"dur":4,"text":"them. And then finally the tool\nitself obeys rate limits. Um"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"this is because we sort of\nwanted to release it as an"},"737":{"dur":4,"text":"internal pen testing tool. Um\nobviously you know people can"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"get around that but we hope you\nknow you guys don't. Um that's"},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"all I'll say about that. Um some\nthings that aren't actually"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"built into the tool that are\nvery very useful. Um first off"},"751":{"dur":4,"text":"um Twitter's actually pretty\ngood if you post every single"},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"post of yours has a link in it.\nUm they're good at finding that"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"and shutting you down. So one of\nthe things we recommend is post"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"a couple you know non phishing\nposts in there or get ready to"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"make a lot of accounts. And then\nanother thing is um if you"},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"yourself the bot have an egg\nprofile you know um nobody's"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"going to actually click on your\nlinks because obviously um they"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"they like to see believable\nprofiles before they click"},"779":{"dur":6,"text":"links. So a very high level of\nuh design flow of the tool. Um"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"first we have a list of Twitter\nusers that we pass into the"},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"tool. It goes through each user\nand asks whether they're a valid"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"you know whether they're a high\nvalue high uh um engagement user"},"794":{"dur":4,"text":"or not. And if they are it\nscrapes their timeline to a"},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"specified depth. Um so for\nexample 200 or 400 tweets that"},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"they've sent. And uses that to\neither seed um [indiscernible]"},"806":{"dur":5,"text":"model or a euro-network model.\nAnd that generates the actual"},"811":{"dur":5,"text":"text of the post. After it's\ngenerated the text then it you"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"can either have it schedule the\ntweet for a later time when"},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"they're most engaged and it\nactually uh calculates all that"},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"for you. Or you can post the\ntweet immediately and have the"},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"uh the tool sweep to obey rate\nlimits. And that's actually"},"830":{"dur":5,"text":"useful if you're doing an\nonstage demo. That yeah. >> Cool"},"837":{"dur":4,"text":"so lets get into the tool. I'll\ntalk about the first phase here"},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"automated target discovery. So\nthis is what Twitter looks like"},"845":{"dur":4,"text":"if anyone's been living under a\nrock for the last 10 years. Um"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"Twitter is full of interesting\ninformation and personal"},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"information like John said. You\nhave this incentivization"},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"structure for disclosing\npersonal data. Um and by that I"},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"mean it's not necessarily just\nthe content of the posts. So the"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"last tweets that were made you\nalso have super value"},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"[indiscernible] information\npresent in the description."},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"People on Twitter tend to like\nto post about what their job"},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"title is and what their\ninterests are generally. Um you"},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"ha you get different kind of\ndata not just text. You have um"},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"integers like how many followers\nand how how many followers you"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"have. How many people are\nfollowing you. How many lists"},"882":{"dur":4,"text":"you belong to. Um you have a lot\nof kind of boolean fields like"},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"have you changed your background\nprofile image? Have you changed"},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"any of your other default\nsettings uh from the original"},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"instant [indiscernible] of your\nregistration? Um it's filled"},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"with different dates like your\ncreated at date and URLs within"},"900":{"dur":4,"text":"the text that you post. So this\nis what the the raw API call"},"904":{"dur":3,"text":"call looks like from Twitter\nwhen you when you grab uh when"},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"you grab it. So I'll I'll use\nthe example for for this section"},"911":{"dur":6,"text":"of Eric Schmidt. The former CEO\nof Google. Um so we we implement"},"917":{"dur":3,"text":"a cluster algorithm so it's\nbased on machine learning we go"},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"out we grab a bunch of Twitter\nusers and we extract features"},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"from these uh from these API\ncalls. Across these different"},"926":{"dur":4,"text":"users. Uh and here I list a few\nof the most most interesting and"},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"most relevant features that we\ngrab. So like I said in in the"},"933":{"dur":3,"text":"description if you have words\nthat tend to correspond to a job"},"937":{"dur":5,"text":"title like CEO CSO CISO uh even\nlike recruiter or you know"},"943":{"dur":2,"text":"engineer or something like this.\nThis is probably going to end up"},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"being someone that you might\nwant to target. Right? Um they"},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"might have access to some\nsensitive information company"},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"information or whatever. If you\nbelong to some other"},"953":{"dur":3,"text":"organization. Um also your level\nengagement. So how many people"},"956":{"dur":3,"text":"are following following you and\nhow many you're following. Um"},"960":{"dur":2,"text":"you can imagine you don't want\nto you don't want to target"},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"somebody who's not very active\non the platform. Uh you wanna"},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"make sure that someone who is\nactively engaged and is likely"},"968":{"dur":3,"text":"to click on links and is getting\nupdates on their phone. Um the"},"972":{"dur":3,"text":"account age is a good piece of\ninformation too. Uh the created"},"975":{"dur":2,"text":"at date of the Twitter profile.\nYou might want to target you"},"978":{"dur":3,"text":"don't really want to target\nsomebody who's just made the"},"981":{"dur":1,"text":"account and is just trying to\nget started up with the"},"983":{"dur":2,"text":"platform. Um same thing for hash\ntag my first tweet. And then"},"985":{"dur":4,"text":"also a good indicator is uh the\ndefault settings. So it um"},"989":{"dur":3,"text":"people who tend to engage a lot\nin the platform um will will"},"993":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of make it fancy. They'll\nchange all the default settings"},"996":{"dur":2,"text":"and they'll make it um more\nmatching to what they're"},"999":{"dur":3,"text":"interests are and what they\nlike. Um so in a nutshell this"},"1002":{"dur":3,"text":"is how it works. If we take the\nclustering algorithm uh and we"},"1005":{"dur":4,"text":"start out with our our target\nEric Schmidt. Um you can imagine"},"1010":{"dur":4,"text":"now that each Twitter user is\nrepresented on this 2-D plot as"},"1015":{"dur":3,"text":"a single point. Um again it's\nI'm projecting it in 2"},"1018":{"dur":2,"text":"dimensions. Originally it was a\nvery very high feature high"},"1021":{"dur":2,"text":"dimensional feature space.

What do we do with\nthat? We pass it through the"},"1035":{"dur":2,"text":"clustering algorithm that we\nhave. Um and I'll talk in in the"},"1038":{"dur":3,"text":"next slide about how we choose\nthat. Um but once once you do"},"1041":{"dur":2,"text":"something like that then you\nactually get to extract a subset"},"1044":{"dur":2,"text":"of these users that you might\ndeem uh as a relevant target or"},"1046":{"dur":2,"text":"a high value target. So up in\nthe left hand corner of the plot"},"1049":{"dur":3,"text":"of red red points there might be\na group of people that you deem"},"1052":{"dur":3,"text":"as high value targets. And the\nthe users who belong in the blue"},"1055":{"dur":2,"text":"and the green points you wanna\nthrow them aside. De-prioritize"},"1058":{"dur":6,"text":"them. Um so in the machine\nlearning world uh there are many"},"1064":{"dur":2,"text":"different clustering algorithms\nso you can choose from. Uh and"},"1067":{"dur":3,"text":"each of those algorithms have a\ncertain set of hyper parameters"},"1070":{"dur":3,"text":"that you can tune to kind of\noptimize your technique and"},"1073":{"dur":3,"text":"optimize your clusters. Uh how\ndo we chose this? We throw a"},"1077":{"dur":4,"text":"bunch of clustering algorithms\nuh into into kind of like a grid"},"1082":{"dur":3,"text":"search more or less. Right? So\nwe have Cayman's and a parameter"},"1085":{"dur":1,"text":"for Cayman's clustering\nalgorithm is the number of"},"1087":{"dur":5,"text":"clusters that you choose\n[indiscernible].

[pause]\nright [pause] >> All right cool."},"1173":{"dur":2,"text":"So uh before we actually get\ninto the cool machine learning"},"1175":{"dur":2,"text":"models and stuff for generating\ntext. We're gonna tease you guys"},"1177":{"dur":2,"text":"a bit with some of the boiler\nplate that goes around the"},"1180":{"dur":3,"text":"tweets. Um so one of the first\nthings that we actually ran into"},"1183":{"dur":3,"text":"was we wanted to choose a url\nshortener right? And uh we want"},"1187":{"dur":2,"text":"the url shortener with a lot of\ndifferent qualities. One of them"},"1190":{"dur":3,"text":"being you know can actually can\nshorten malicious links. And so"},"1193":{"dur":2,"text":"the first thing is we went out\nwe found a malicious link we"},"1196":{"dur":3,"text":"verified using virus total that\nit is indeed malicious. And we"},"1199":{"dur":3,"text":"actually went to it too in a\nsandbox and all that. And we"},"1203":{"dur":2,"text":"tried it through a lot of\ndifferent link na shorteners and"},"1205":{"dur":3,"text":"apparently google gl let's us\nshorten it. Right? And so"},"1208":{"dur":3,"text":"actually several others also let\nus shorten it. But goo dot gl"},"1212":{"dur":3,"text":"gives us a lot of cool other\nthings. Um first off it it gives"},"1215":{"dur":2,"text":"us sort of like a timeline of\nwhen people click. And"},"1218":{"dur":3,"text":"apparently this link is already\nbeen shortened before and people"},"1221":{"dur":4,"text":"of clicked it. Um that's you\nknow a tale for another time. Um"},"1226":{"dur":2,"text":"goo dot gl also gives us a lot\nof cool analytics like who"},"1228":{"dur":4,"text":"referred the link? For example t\ndot ceo. Um what browser did the"},"1232":{"dur":4,"text":"target use? What country were\nthey based in? Or at least you"},"1237":{"dur":4,"text":"know did there uh um like actual\nmachine say they were? And uh"},"1241":{"dur":3,"text":"what platform they so Windows\nChrome you know those sorts of"},"1245":{"dur":6,"text":"things. Uh Android um and all\nthat. Um so yeah. So goo dot gl"},"1252":{"dur":2,"text":"actually looks pretty\nlegitimate. I ran it by a few"},"1254":{"dur":2,"text":"guys in there and they were like\nhey yeah like it comes from"},"1256":{"dur":3,"text":"Google it's gotta be safe.\nRight? And no. Um it can link to"},"1260":{"dur":3,"text":"malicious sites. So we verified\nthat. Um it also gives us really"},"1264":{"dur":2,"text":"cool analytics which is very\nuseful if you're you know trying"},"1266":{"dur":2,"text":"to spear phish internally right?\nYou want to know which users"},"1269":{"dur":3,"text":"clicked. Um but some other cools\nthings that it gives us is it"},"1273":{"dur":2,"text":"you're able to actually create\nshortened links on the fly using"},"1275":{"dur":3,"text":"their APIs. So you can actually\nsay hey here's this you know"},"1279":{"dur":3,"text":"general payload www dot google\ndot com. Let's shorten it"},"1282":{"dur":3,"text":"uniquely for each individual\nuser. And see you know which end"},"1286":{"dur":3,"text":"of those real users actually\nclick on the link. And then you"},"1289":{"dur":3,"text":"can also obtain all of these\nanalytics programmatically. So"},"1292":{"dur":3,"text":"there's really like no manual\nyou know uh uh process that you"},"1296":{"dur":4,"text":"need at all um in this this\nentire process. And uh we'll"},"1300":{"dur":4,"text":"we'll go ahead and give the the\nnote that we never actually"},"1304":{"dur":4,"text":"posted any malicious links to\nany targets. We just verified"},"1308":{"dur":4,"text":"that you can actually shorten\nmalicious links in here. Um so"},"1312":{"dur":4,"text":"please don't get mad at us about\nthat. And then finally another"},"1317":{"dur":3,"text":"thing that the tool does uh in\nthe box is it does some basic"},"1320":{"dur":4,"text":"recon and profiling. Um so 2\nthings that it does is it"},"1324":{"dur":4,"text":"figures out what time the user\nis uh likely to engage the"},"1329":{"dur":2,"text":"platform. And it um looks at\nwhat topics that they're"},"1332":{"dur":3,"text":"interested in and tries to\ncreate uh a tweet based on one"},"1335":{"dur":4,"text":"of those topics. So for actually\nfiguring out the scheduling the"},"1340":{"dur":3,"text":"post the what time the user is\nactive we just use a simple"},"1343":{"dur":4,"text":"histogram for tweet times what\nuh which hours that that user"},"1348":{"dur":3,"text":"tweets. And over on the left\nyou'll actually see my own uh"},"1351":{"dur":4,"text":"tweet history uh timings um so\nyou can actually see that I'm"},"1355":{"dur":4,"text":"most active at 11 pm at night.\nTake that what you will. Um but"},"1360":{"dur":5,"text":"it's it's actually very easy to\nfind this data. Right? And uh"},"1365":{"dur":3,"text":"for topics we actually started\nlike when we first started this"},"1369":{"dur":2,"text":"project we were thinking really\nreally complicated like you know"},"1371":{"dur":3,"text":"super lda and all the things and\nwhat not. Um but we found"},"1375":{"dur":3,"text":"actually pretty early on was\njust a simple bag of words and"},"1378":{"dur":2,"text":"counting frequency does really\nwell for finding topics as long"},"1381":{"dur":3,"text":"as you remove all of the stop\nwords. Um so with these 2 things"},"1384":{"dur":3,"text":"we can actually see the models\nand sweep you know the tool to"},"1388":{"dur":3,"text":"uh tweet at a time when the user\nis likely to respond. And also"},"1391":{"dur":2,"text":"tweet on something that they're\nlikely to be engaged with."},"1400":{"dur":4,"text":"[pause] >> Great so so at this\npoint now we've taken a bunch of"},"1404":{"dur":2,"text":"input users and extracted a\nsubset of them that we want to"},"1407":{"dur":3,"text":"target. Uh and we calculated\nwhat they like to talk about."},"1410":{"dur":3,"text":"The topic. And we've also\ndetermined that at which time"},"1413":{"dur":2,"text":"are they're most active with\nwith Twitter or with the Twitter"},"1416":{"dur":4,"text":"platform. So now how do we go\nabout getting um getting them a"},"1420":{"dur":3,"text":"tweet that they might be more\nlikely to click on than your"},"1423":{"dur":4,"text":"your normal uh any random\nquestion. So we do we do this in"},"1427":{"dur":2,"text":"2 separate ways. And the first\nway is we leverage markup"},"1430":{"dur":2,"text":"models. Um so markup models\nthey're populated for text"},"1433":{"dur":3,"text":"generation like John said the\nsubset simulator or in the info"},"1437":{"dur":4,"text":"[indiscernible] talk title bot.\nBut how it works is um using"},"1441":{"dur":4,"text":"Twitter API you can go and grab\nthe last x post on someone's"},"1446":{"dur":4,"text":"timeline right? 200 500 1000 um\nhowever many you want to grab."},"1450":{"dur":3,"text":"And we call this the corpus. So\nyou take your corpus and you"},"1453":{"dur":4,"text":"want to learn um pair of y\nfrequencies of um of likeliness"},"1458":{"dur":3,"text":"between these words. Right? So\nuh for example you might you"},"1462":{"dur":2,"text":"might have the word I that\noccurs a lot within this corpus."},"1465":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes it might be followed\nby the word don't. Other times"},"1467":{"dur":3,"text":"it might be followed by the word\nlike. So based on the relative"},"1471":{"dur":2,"text":"co-occurance of these words in\nyour corpus you can then"},"1473":{"dur":4,"text":"generate a model that\nprobabilistically determines um"},"1478":{"dur":3,"text":"how likely it is to create kind\nof this string of sentences. I"},"1481":{"dur":2,"text":"like or I don't. And you can\ncontinue this uh for the length"},"1484":{"dur":2,"text":"of the entire tweet. So it's\nbased on purely transition"},"1487":{"dur":5,"text":"probabilities from one word to\nthe next. Um on the other hand"},"1492":{"dur":3,"text":"we trained the recurrent\neuro-network. Um and this is"},"1495":{"dur":3,"text":"called LSTM. And LSTM is an\nacronym for Long Short Term"},"1499":{"dur":3,"text":"Memory. And so this is a bit\nmore cumbersome. It's less"},"1502":{"dur":3,"text":"flexible than the markup model.\nUm we took five and a half days"},"1506":{"dur":5,"text":"to to train this neuro-net. Um\nwe had to do it on an EC2"},"1511":{"dur":3,"text":"instance using a GPU cluster.\nAnd the training set was"},"1515":{"dur":3,"text":"comprised of approximately 2\nmillion tweets. We didn't go out"},"1518":{"dur":4,"text":"and just grab um your run of the\nmill any 2 million tweets. Um"},"1522":{"dur":2,"text":"because like I said Twitter\n[laugh] Twitter is a veritable"},"1525":{"dur":3,"text":"cess pool. So we had to go and\nfind kind of legitimate looking"},"1529":{"dur":4,"text":"tweets. Uh to do that uh Twitter\nhas an account called at um at"},"1533":{"dur":4,"text":"verified. And that account in\nturn follows all the verified"},"1538":{"dur":2,"text":"accounts on Twitter. All the\nones with that blue check mark"},"1540":{"dur":3,"text":"next to it. And so our idea was\nthat this the people that are uh"},"1544":{"dur":3,"text":"that are verified accounts are\nprobably more legitimate."},"1547":{"dur":1,"text":"They're probably posting about\nsome kind of relevant"},"1549":{"dur":2,"text":"information. And so we trained\nit on this huge corpus of"},"1551":{"dur":3,"text":"tweets. The network properties\nwe used 3 layers of this"},"1554":{"dur":2,"text":"euro-network and approximately 5\nlegit layers per [indiscernible]"},"1557":{"dur":4,"text":"uh units per layer. Sorry. And\nthe idea here is that"},"1561":{"dur":3,"text":"neuro-networks are or at least\nthis neuro-network in in"},"1565":{"dur":4,"text":"particular is is much better at\nlearning long term dependencies"},"1569":{"dur":3,"text":"between words in a sentence. So\nLSTMs are often deployed when"},"1572":{"dur":3,"text":"people want to learn uh\nsequences of data. Un and in"},"1576":{"dur":3,"text":"this context you can imagine a\ntweet or a sentences being a"},"1579":{"dur":4,"text":"sequence of words. Right? So as\nthe in in contract to the markup"},"1584":{"dur":2,"text":"model which just care about the\n[indiscernible] frequency. The"},"1587":{"dur":2,"text":"word that follows this word. The\nrecurrent neuro-network on the"},"1590":{"dur":3,"text":"other hand considers long longer\nterm dependencies. Because what"},"1593":{"dur":2,"text":"I talk about at the beginning of\nmy sentence might also relate to"},"1595":{"dur":3,"text":"something that comes later on.\nUh this is common in all all"},"1599":{"dur":2,"text":"languages and English uh and\nmost common in German actually."},"1602":{"dur":2,"text":"You have these long term\ndependencies. You might not know"},"1605":{"dur":2,"text":"what the context of the sentence\nis until someone finally"},"1607":{"dur":4,"text":"finishes the word at the end of\nit. Um so what were the"},"1612":{"dur":2,"text":"differences between these 2\napproaches? The LSTM as I"},"1614":{"dur":2,"text":"mentioned took a few a days to\ntrain. Uh so it's a bit less"},"1617":{"dur":3,"text":"flexible. Far as the markup\nchain uh markup chain you can"},"1620":{"dur":3,"text":"deploy it uh and it can learn\nwith within a matter matter of"},"1623":{"dur":3,"text":"milliseconds. And that kind of\nscales depending on how many"},"1626":{"dur":3,"text":"tweets you choose to train it\non. Uh the accuracy for both"},"1629":{"dur":2,"text":"surprisingly was super high. So\neven thought the LSTM is a bit"},"1632":{"dur":4,"text":"more generic um and by that I\nmean it learns like a kind of a"},"1637":{"dur":3,"text":"deeper representation of what it\nmeans to be a Twitter post. And"},"1640":{"dur":3,"text":"I I caution myself not to call\nit English because as John said"},"1644":{"dur":2,"text":"this isn't English this is kind\nof twitterese. It's filled with"},"1647":{"dur":5,"text":"hash tags and and different kind\nof syntatical auto ease and um"},"1652":{"dur":4,"text":"abbreviations. Uh so the\navailability of both of these"},"1656":{"dur":5,"text":"tools uh is public. You can go\nout. You can download um a LSTM"},"1662":{"dur":3,"text":"model using different python\nlibraries or other otherwise"},"1665":{"dur":4,"text":"markup chain as well. Uh and the\nsize of these LSTM is much much"},"1670":{"dur":3,"text":"largest around dick uh disk\ncompared to the markup chain. Um"},"1673":{"dur":2,"text":"but like I said the markup chain\ntends to over fit on each"},"1675":{"dur":3,"text":"specific user. The idea being\nlet's say you're posting today"},"1679":{"dur":2,"text":"or in the next week about the\nOlympics. Or something like"},"1681":{"dur":3,"text":"that. Maybe 2 months from now if\nI go back and I read your"},"1685":{"dur":3,"text":"historical timeline posts and I\nI tweet back at you with"},"1688":{"dur":2,"text":"something about the Olympics uh\nit might raise your eyebrows"},"1691":{"dur":2,"text":"because the Olympics have been\nover for a while and you don't"},"1694":{"dur":5,"text":"really care about them anymore.\nUm the cool thing about markup"},"1699":{"dur":2,"text":"models that [indiscernible] is\nthat you don't need to retrain"},"1701":{"dur":2,"text":"it every time. Like I said it's\nvery flexible. You can deploy it"},"1704":{"dur":3,"text":"very fast. Um what this means is\nthat it generalizes out of the"},"1708":{"dur":4,"text":"box to different languages. It's\nit's language agnostic. Uh so if"},"1713":{"dur":2,"text":"you're posting on Twitter and\nyou're you're posting in Spanish"},"1715":{"dur":3,"text":"or even Russian or Chinese\nentirely different character"},"1719":{"dur":2,"text":"sets um because it's based on\nthese [indiscernible]"},"1721":{"dur":3,"text":"probabilities it's gonna\ndynamically learn you know what"},"1725":{"dur":1,"text":"word likes to be followed by the\nnext. And you're then able to"},"1726":{"dur":4,"text":"post a a tweet back at somebody\nbased on the language they're"},"1731":{"dur":4,"text":"typing in. So here's an example.\nUm that's in Spanish. And if"},"1735":{"dur":3,"text":"anyone is from a foreign country\nhere with a lot of foreign"},"1738":{"dur":3,"text":"language tweets um and while\nit's a volunteer for the demo."},"1742":{"dur":4,"text":"Again please tweet at that hash\ntag snapper. Um so we don't like"},"1746":{"dur":3,"text":"to think of this necessarily\nalso as a Twitter vulnerability"},"1750":{"dur":3,"text":"so to speak. Um this can be\napplied to other social networks"},"1754":{"dur":4,"text":"as well. But it all has pretty\naccessible APIs. But the idea"},"1758":{"dur":3,"text":"here is that um kind of like\nwith the rate with the rise of"},"1762":{"dur":2,"text":"AI and the rise of machine\nlearning and the democratization"},"1765":{"dur":3,"text":"of this as it becomes more and\nmore possible to do this without"},"1768":{"dur":2,"text":"a PhD for example and the\ntechnology grows and grows and"},"1771":{"dur":5,"text":"becomes more available um th\nthis is gonna be become more and"},"1776":{"dur":6,"text":"more of a problem. Right? So uh\nthe the weak point here is is a"},"1783":{"dur":4,"text":"human this is uh classic social\nengineering. [pause] >> Cool"},"1788":{"dur":3,"text":"yeah so before we get into the\nevaluation results and demo. I"},"1791":{"dur":3,"text":"just wanna say um the tool is\npublic. So for example there's a"},"1795":{"dur":3,"text":"version on your conference CDs.\nAnd there will also be a get hub"},"1798":{"dur":2,"text":"link that we'll tweet out uh as\nsoon as we get back home to"},"1801":{"dur":4,"text":"Baltimore. But uh we first uh we\nfirst trained our first couple"},"1806":{"dur":2,"text":"of models and started wild\ntesting it. And we were"},"1808":{"dur":3,"text":"surprised it did really really\nwell. Um I don't know if you can"},"1812":{"dur":3,"text":"actually see some of the\npictures but uh for example we"},"1815":{"dur":3,"text":"got uh a guy on the top right um\nthe first post is what our bot"},"1819":{"dur":3,"text":"posted. And the second is like\nthe guy responding saying hey"},"1823":{"dur":1,"text":"thanks but the links broken.\nRight? Um we actually saw this"},"1824":{"dur":1,"text":"quite a bit. And uh on the\nbottom you can see some of the"},"1825":{"dur":1,"text":"example tweets from the first\nmodels that we made. Um so we we"},"1827":{"dur":1,"text":"used these first couple of\nmodels and we did some pilot"},"1828":{"dur":5,"text":"experiments. Um we grabbed 90\nusers from hash tag cat because"},"1842":{"dur":4,"text":"cats are awesome. And uh we went\nahead and tried to spear phish"},"1846":{"dur":4,"text":"um all these users again with\nbenign links. And uh we were"},"1850":{"dur":4,"text":"actually surprised at how well\nthe model did right out of the"},"1854":{"dur":4,"text":"box. Um after 2 hours 17% of\nthose users had clicked through."},"1858":{"dur":5,"text":"And after 2 days we had you know\nbetween a 30 and 65 percent um"},"1863":{"dur":3,"text":"66 percent sorry click through\nrate. And so why that range is"},"1867":{"dur":3,"text":"so huge actually? Is because\nthere are a lot of bots crawling"},"1870":{"dur":4,"text":"Twitter clicking on links. Um so\nwe actually don't know exactly"},"1874":{"dur":3,"text":"how many actual humans click\nthrough. If we use the actual"},"1878":{"dur":3,"text":"strictest definition of what a\nhuman might be so making sure"},"1882":{"dur":2,"text":"that for example [indiscernible]\ndot CEO. And the location"},"1884":{"dur":2,"text":"matches up with the location\nlisted on their profile and"},"1887":{"dur":2,"text":"those sorts of things. That's\nwhere we get that 30% number. Um"},"1890":{"dur":4,"text":"if we if we use a little bit\nmore relaxed uh criteria for"},"1894":{"dur":4,"text":"judging whether it's a human or\na bot. Um we actually can get up"},"1899":{"dur":3,"text":"to like the number of people\nthat we think clicked might be"},"1902":{"dur":5,"text":"up to 66%. And so uh actually uh\nfunny story um with these"},"1908":{"dur":3,"text":"initial models also we saw how\nwell they did. And um an"},"1911":{"dur":2,"text":"information security\nprofessional who will remain"},"1914":{"dur":3,"text":"unnamed tweeted at us saying hey\nproof of concept or get the fuck"},"1918":{"dur":3,"text":"out of here. So we went ahead\nand used him as a guinea pig and"},"1922":{"dur":2,"text":"it did actually he did click the\nlink. So we will say that."},"1931":{"dur":2,"text":"[laughter] [clapping] Cool. So\nuh so then we iterated on the"},"1934":{"dur":3,"text":"model some. And we uh decided we\nwanted to test this against a"},"1937":{"dur":3,"text":"human. Right? Um see how well\nthe human could spear phish or"},"1941":{"dur":5,"text":"phish people. Um versus how well\nthat the tool could. And uh so"},"1946":{"dur":4,"text":"we had 2 hours. We uh scheduled\non our calendar. And the person"},"1951":{"dur":4,"text":"was able in these 2 hours to\ntarget 129 people. And he did so"},"1955":{"dur":3,"text":"mostly by just copying and\npasting you know pre-made"},"1958":{"dur":3,"text":"messages to these different hash\ntags that we talked about"},"1962":{"dur":5,"text":"previously. I think they were\npokeman go info sect um and uh"},"1967":{"dur":5,"text":"something about the DNC. And uh\nso we uh he was able to tweet it"},"1973":{"dur":4,"text":"um 129 people in these 2 hours.\nWhich comes out to be 1 point 0"},"1977":{"dur":3,"text":"7 5 tweets per minute. And he\ngot a total of 49 click"},"1980":{"dur":4,"text":"throughs. We used 1 instance of\nour tool. So 1 instance of"},"1984":{"dur":4,"text":"snapper running. Um and in those\nsame 2 hours snapper tweeted at"},"1989":{"dur":4,"text":"819 people. Which comes out to 6\npoint 8 5 tweets per minute. And"},"1994":{"dur":4,"text":"275 of those people clicked\nthrough. And we sort of want to"},"1998":{"dur":3,"text":"emphasize that this is actually\narbitrarily scaleable with the"},"2002":{"dur":2,"text":"number of machines that you\nhave. The major rate uh the"},"2004":{"dur":3,"text":"major limiting factors are\nactually rate limiting and the"},"2007":{"dur":5,"text":"posting mechanism. [pause] So um\nsort of a TLDR. Um this tool"},"2014":{"dur":4,"text":"that we've made um they're 2\ntraditional ways of you know"},"2018":{"dur":3,"text":"creating tweets or or messages\nthat people will click on. The"},"2022":{"dur":3,"text":"first is you know phishing which\nis mostly automated already. And"},"2025":{"dur":2,"text":"has a very very low click\nthrough rate. Um between 5 and"},"2028":{"dur":3,"text":"14 percent. There's also this\nother method called spear"},"2032":{"dur":2,"text":"phishing which takes tens of\nminutes to do. It's highly"},"2034":{"dur":3,"text":"manual. You have to actually go\nout research your target. Find"},"2037":{"dur":2,"text":"out what they enjoy doing. What\ntime they're interested in"},"2039":{"dur":3,"text":"posting at. Things like that. Um\nyou get the best spear phishing"},"2043":{"dur":3,"text":"campaigns actually get up to a\n45% accuracy from what we've"},"2046":{"dur":1,"text":"seen. And uh we actually kind of\nsplit the difference. We"},"2048":{"dur":1,"text":"actually combine the automated\num um characteristics of"},"2049":{"dur":1,"text":"actually phishing but we still\nget pretty close to what the"},"2050":{"dur":1,"text":"actual um effectiveness of spear\nphishing. And with that demo"},"2052":{"dur":1,"text":"gods willing we'll do a live\ndemo of this. [pause] Cool."},"2053":{"dur":1,"text":"Right? So [pause] I just want to\nsee so about 151 of you have"},"2054":{"dur":2,"text":"actually tweeted. So this is the\nactual command to uh uh run the"},"2056":{"dur":5,"text":"tool. And we're gonna go ahead\nand run it. Hopefully. Cool. Um"},"2066":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm actually the first person on\nthe list. Cause I actually you"},"2069":{"dur":2,"text":"know wanted to make sure that\nsomething worked right. [pause]"},"2072":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's see. So what it's doing is\nactually it pulled down the"},"2075":{"dur":2,"text":"users timeline and generated a\ntweet for that person. And c'mon"},"2078":{"dur":2,"text":"c'mon. Cool. Actually. Okay so\nhere it's starting to come out."},"2081":{"dur":2,"text":"Um so here's that actual post\nthat it generated. And it uh"},"2084":{"dur":5,"text":"posted you know at my hash tag\nthe text that it grabbed from my"},"2110":{"dur":5,"text":"profile and the shortened link.\nAnd um so you can see that that"},"2126":{"dur":5,"text":"actually works. And we're not\njust saying things. [pause] So"},"2131":{"dur":4,"text":"notice that um on my actual you\nknow timeline you can't actually"},"2136":{"dur":3,"text":"see that post. Right? And this\nis because it's actually called"},"2139":{"dur":5,"text":"a reply. [pause] But hopefully\nyep so here's where it actually"},"2146":{"dur":2,"text":"shows up. It shows up in your\nnotifications. Not your actual"},"2149":{"dur":2,"text":"Tweet history. And so you're the\nonly one who can actually see"},"2152":{"dur":6,"text":"that. And so uh as you can tell\num yeah. I just got spear"},"2158":{"dur":3,"text":"phished if I click this link. So\nit's actually running thorough"},"2162":{"dur":2,"text":"all you guys now who tweeted at\nthe link and generating text for"},"2165":{"dur":3,"text":"you and posting them. Um so\nwe'll leave that running as long"},"2168":{"dur":2,"text":"as possible but it'll probably\nwon't get through all of you"},"2170":{"dur":5,"text":"guys while we uh wrap up the\ntalk. [pause until 36:22] >>"},"2182":{"dur":5,"text":"Cool. Thank you demo gods. Um\nright. And just a few words to"},"2187":{"dur":4,"text":"wrap up. Um why did we do this?\nUh we wanted generally just"},"2192":{"dur":3,"text":"raise awareness and educate\npeople about the the"},"2196":{"dur":5,"text":"susceptibility and the danger of\nsocial media security. Um like"},"2201":{"dur":3,"text":"John said people usually think\nabout email uh very cautiously."},"2205":{"dur":3,"text":"You would never open a link in\nan email from somebody that you"},"2208":{"dur":2,"text":"never interacted with before.\nAnd we want to have that same"},"2211":{"dur":3,"text":"culture be instituted on Twitter\nnow and on other kind of social"},"2214":{"dur":3,"text":"networks. Um another way that\nyou could use this tool is to if"},"2218":{"dur":3,"text":"you belong to a company um or in\nsome other kind of organization"},"2221":{"dur":3,"text":"you wanna do some internal pen\ntesting to see how susceptible"},"2224":{"dur":3,"text":"your employees might be to some\nkind of attack like this. This"},"2227":{"dur":3,"text":"could generate good statistics\nfor you and help you refine your"},"2231":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of educational awareness\nprograms. Um you could also use"},"2234":{"dur":2,"text":"this for general social\nengagement staff recruiting."},"2237":{"dur":2,"text":"Reading stuff off people's\ntimelines and then crafting a"},"2239":{"dur":2,"text":"tweet geared at them. Might be a\ngood way to recruit people or"},"2241":{"dur":3,"text":"even for advertising. The click\nthrough rates here we have are"},"2245":{"dur":3,"text":"are pretty huge compared to your\ngeneral uh generic advertising"},"2248":{"dur":5,"text":"campaigns. Um so like I said ML\nis becoming more and more"},"2253":{"dur":2,"text":"automated. Data science is\ngrowing. A lot more companies"},"2256":{"dur":3,"text":"are hiring data scientists. And\nthe tools in the tool box are"},"2260":{"dur":3,"text":"becoming a lot more uh\ndemocratized. You you can you"},"2263":{"dur":2,"text":"can easily go out there's free\nsoftware you can use to train"},"2266":{"dur":4,"text":"these models. Um including the\none that we'll release today. So"},"2270":{"dur":2,"text":"the enemy will have this so the\nadversary will be able to use"},"2273":{"dur":3,"text":"this to leverage this technology\nsooner rather than later. Um one"},"2277":{"dur":3,"text":"way you can try to prevent these\nkinds of attacks is to enable"},"2280":{"dur":2,"text":"protect the account on your\nTwitter uh on your Twitter"},"2283":{"dur":3,"text":"users. So if you protect your\naccount you can go out through"},"2287":{"dur":3,"text":"the public APIs and grab your\ndata. Um there might also be"},"2290":{"dur":3,"text":"ways to detect this stuff using\nas I said at the beginning of"},"2293":{"dur":3,"text":"the talk automated methods like\nmachine learning classifiers or"},"2297":{"dur":6,"text":"whatever have you. Um and also\nif you're ever unsure always"},"2303":{"dur":4,"text":"always report a user or report a\nposter um if you see a tweet"},"2307":{"dur":2,"text":"like this maybe. Twitter is\npretty good at actually"},"2310":{"dur":4,"text":"responding to these reports. Um\nand we we use google dot com as"},"2314":{"dur":2,"text":"our shortened link that that you\nredirect to so feel safe to"},"2317":{"dur":4,"text":"click it. Um because if we if we\ndid something more funny like"},"2321":{"dur":2,"text":"redirect to our Black Hat talk\npeople might get pissed and try"},"2323":{"dur":3,"text":"to report us. We don't want our\nbot to get uh our bot to get"},"2326":{"dur":5,"text":"bend. And so in conclusion ML\ncan not only only be used in a"},"2331":{"dur":3,"text":"defensive way but you can use it\nto automate an attack. Um"},"2335":{"dur":2,"text":"Twitter is especially nice for\nthis kind of thing because the"},"2338":{"dur":3,"text":"people don't really care if the\nmessage is in perfect English."},"2341":{"dur":2,"text":"It's slang laden. It's\nabbreviation laden. And these"},"2344":{"dur":3,"text":"things actually help the\naccuracy of our tool. Uh and"},"2347":{"dur":3,"text":"finally data is out there. It's\npublicly available and it can be"},"2351":{"dur":3,"text":"leveraged against someone to\nsocial engineer them. And with"},"2354":{"dur":6,"text":"that we'll take some\nquestions.[applause] So just"},"2361":{"dur":5,"text":"step up to the uh microphone. If\nyou have a question. [pause"},"2375":{"dur":5,"text":"until 39:48 - off mic comments -\npause until 40:00] >> Hello ah"},"2393":{"dur":5,"text":"so do you I can hear it >>\nAlright if you come >> Yeah >>"},"2404":{"dur":3,"text":"if you just say it we'll repeat\nit >> oh >> So have you tried"},"2408":{"dur":2,"text":"implementing anything like\nchange point detection? For"},"2411":{"dur":3,"text":"cause I know that some research\nhas been done in using Twitter"},"2415":{"dur":3,"text":"for like thread analysis as\nwell. It's like trying to"},"2418":{"dur":4,"text":"pinpoint users who say work for\nlike ISIL or ISIS. And have you"},"2422":{"dur":2,"text":"done any research using like\nmarkoff chains or prior"},"2425":{"dur":5,"text":"distribution detection systems?\n>> You wanna take that one? Uh"},"2432":{"dur":2,"text":"[off mic comments] >> Alright so\num we haven't um done any"},"2435":{"dur":3,"text":"research for the purpose of this\ntalk into that. Um but it's"},"2438":{"dur":3,"text":"definitely a cool thing that\nwe'd like to look into. So if"},"2441":{"dur":3,"text":"you wanna talk to us a bit more\nafter the talk about it. We can"},"2444":{"dur":5,"text":"uh get some you know information\nand trade some ideas. [pause -"},"2452":{"dur":1,"text":"off mic comments] >> Great\npresentation. Uh quick question"},"2454":{"dur":3,"text":"pertaining to the environment of\na mobile platform as this"},"2457":{"dur":3,"text":"applies. Cause I know you guys\ntouched on mobile. You mentioned"},"2461":{"dur":4,"text":"phone or smart phone per se. Can\nyou kind of just give me any"},"2465":{"dur":4,"text":"additional thoughts on that\narea. >> Um sure so we haven't"},"2470":{"dur":2,"text":"actually uh measure like the\ndifferences between how many"},"2472":{"dur":4,"text":"click on mobile versus how many\nclick you know from uh a PC or"},"2477":{"dur":3,"text":"something like that. Um but it's\nit's something that we can"},"2480":{"dur":2,"text":"definitely do. So if you're\ninterested in it you know tweet"},"2483":{"dur":3,"text":"at us and we can crunch some\nnumbers for you. [pause] >> Okay"},"2487":{"dur":3,"text":"you were mentioning that your\nneural network uh version of the"},"2490":{"dur":3,"text":"text prediction performed better\nthan the markoff model in terms"},"2494":{"dur":4,"text":"of like temporal accuracy. Um\nwhat about the neural network"},"2498":{"dur":3,"text":"causes that? Uh over the markoff\nmodel and what would prevent"},"2501":{"dur":2,"text":"that from talking about the\nOlympics some month from now?"},"2504":{"dur":3,"text":"And admittedly a new bend on\nneural networks? >> Yeah sure."},"2508":{"dur":2,"text":"Um you know I definitely\nrecommend looking at some"},"2510":{"dur":3,"text":"documentation about LSTMs. Um\nneural networks in principal can"},"2514":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of replicate any any kind\nof arbitrary function. This is a"},"2517":{"dur":3,"text":"special kind of neural network\nthat has different gates in"},"2521":{"dur":4,"text":"between each um each layer of\nthe LSTM. And these gates kind"},"2525":{"dur":4,"text":"of turn on and off dynamically.\nAnd so it allows you to uh"},"2530":{"dur":4,"text":"remember words at like um a\ncertain depth back in time. Uh"},"2535":{"dur":4,"text":"and it learns these connections\non the fly. And it's able to"},"2539":{"dur":2,"text":"turn it off and on and because\nof that you're able to like lear"},"2542":{"dur":2,"text":"learn longer contextual\ninformation in these words."},"2549":{"dur":3,"text":"[pause] >> Hey great preso. Uh\njust have a question I wanted to"},"2552":{"dur":2,"text":"see what kind of considerations\nyou had for trying to prevent"},"2555":{"dur":3,"text":"bias in your training set. And\nwhat were some like time biases"},"2558":{"dur":2,"text":"or even just using the approved\nTwitter handles might introduce"},"2561":{"dur":2,"text":"some bias in terms of the data\nyou're looking at. Could you"},"2563":{"dur":3,"text":"discuss some of that? >> Yeah\nthat's that's definitely some"},"2566":{"dur":3,"text":"valid criticism. So you want to\navoid you know common defaults"},"2570":{"dur":3,"text":"like overfitting to specific\nusers. Especially in the in the"},"2573":{"dur":5,"text":"clustering thing. Um yep. We we\ndidn't do any kind of uh formal"},"2580":{"dur":3,"text":"evaluation of the LSTM. We have\na loss that we tried to minimize"},"2584":{"dur":4,"text":"over time. Um but in terms of\nthe markoff model we just kind"},"2589":{"dur":3,"text":"of tuned it until it looked good\nenough and then and then worked"},"2592":{"dur":3,"text":"in in terms of like you know we\nwe had several different tests"},"2595":{"dur":2,"text":"in the wild. And as soon as we\nstarted getting pretty high"},"2597":{"dur":1,"text":"click through rates we got\npretty confident that it was"},"2599":{"dur":5,"text":"working. >> So fascinating work\nwith some pretty ground breaking"},"2605":{"dur":3,"text":"implications. I mean given the\nfact that your intent is to fake"},"2609":{"dur":3,"text":"people out to believe that these\nare real. How do you sort of"},"2612":{"dur":4,"text":"pass the Twitter touring test if\nyou will? >> Yeah that's a"},"2617":{"dur":5,"text":"really good question. Um so the\nthe turn test now is um it's"},"2622":{"dur":1,"text":"really interesting I think\nthere's even conferences"},"2624":{"dur":4,"text":"dedicated to um having machines\ntry to bypass or try to pass the"},"2628":{"dur":3,"text":"turn test.

And nowadays you actually"},"2637":{"dur":3,"text":"have to check a lot more boxes\nin order to get past it. Um yeah"},"2640":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean given our click through\nrates it seems like Twitter is"},"2644":{"dur":4,"text":"uh is super super easy to do\nthis kind of thing on. I mean I"},"2648":{"dur":2,"text":"would argue that each kind of\npositive results here in our"},"2651":{"dur":2,"text":"statistics is more or less\npassing of the touring test."},"2653":{"dur":5,"text":"Right?
