dermatologist\nDr. Doug Leone."},"102":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you so much for coming back to Being\nWell."},"104":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. Leone:\nThanks a lot for having me again."},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"I appreciate it.\n>>Lori Casey;"},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, acne.\nI had it as a teenager."},"108":{"dur":1,"text":"Did you have it as a teenager?\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"We all had it.\nYeah, yeah."},"110":{"dur":3,"text":"We all, I had more of adult acne, but yeah.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"114":{"dur":4,"text":"It's something that affects a lot of people,\nand it's really hard as a teenager to have"},"118":{"dur":1,"text":"your skin break out.\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"119":{"dur":1,"text":"It is.\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"Alright.\nSo, tell me first, well, what is acne, and"},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"what causes it?\nWe'll talk about it in, we'll start with the"},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"teenage acne first.\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay.\nYeah, so acne, basically you need a few different"},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"things.\nThe main thing is hormones, okay."},"131":{"dur":4,"text":"That's why we don't have a lot of acne when\nwe're 8, 9, 10, and then we hit the early"},"136":{"dur":3,"text":"teenage years, it starts to come.\nSo, what happens is hormone production goes"},"140":{"dur":3,"text":"up.\nWhen hormone production goes up, oil production"},"143":{"dur":3,"text":"goes up, okay.\nAnd when that happens, it makes the cells"},"147":{"dur":4,"text":"in our skin a little bit sticky.\nAnd so, what happens is we get a plugged hair"},"151":{"dur":4,"text":"follicle with those sticky cells and oil,\nand that's the first step in forming acne."},"155":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, we all have bacteria in each one\nof our hair follicles, and that bacterium"},"160":{"dur":3,"text":"eats the oil.\nAnd once it's blocked up with those cells,"},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"dead cells and oil, you get an acne lesion.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"Mmhmm.\nAnd you have millions of hair follicles on"},"170":{"dur":1,"text":"your face?\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"171":{"dur":1,"text":"Billions of hair follicles.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"172":{"dur":1,"text":"So, it can happen, really, anywhere.\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"174":{"dur":1,"text":"Yep, all over your body.\nSo, yeah."},"175":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"176":{"dur":2,"text":"So, there's different types of acne.\nCan you kind of tell us what those are?"},"178":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Leone:\nSure."},"179":{"dur":4,"text":"There's comedonal acne, and that tends to\nbe less of what we think of as acne."},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"And there's two types of comedonal acne: there's\nthe blackheads, which we all know of, and"},"189":{"dur":4,"text":"those are called open comedones, and then\nthere's whiteheads, which are not actually"},"193":{"dur":5,"text":"pustules, but closed comedones are skin colored\nbumps of acne, and often patients don't even"},"198":{"dur":4,"text":"realize it's type of acne, but it is, and\nis quite common, especially in teenagers."},"203":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, there's what's called the inflammatory\nor nodulocystic acne, and that's kind of what"},"207":{"dur":4,"text":"you and I, and most people think of, oh I\nhave acne, is all these pustules and stuff"},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"that we can, you know, pop and they hit the\nmirror, and whatever."},"213":{"dur":4,"text":"But that's what most people think of as acne,\nbut there's actually three forms of acne."},"218":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nAt what age do you start seeing kids with"},"221":{"dur":1,"text":"acne?\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"223":{"dur":4,"text":"It's actually getting a little bit younger,\nbut usually as soon as the hormones start"},"227":{"dur":5,"text":"kicking in, so at the same time females start\nto hit those changes, and usually around as"},"232":{"dur":6,"text":"young as like 8 to 9 years of age, but usually\nby 11, 12, 13, most females have had some"},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"type of acne.\nAnd by the time you've hit 14, 15, 16, almost"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"all teenagers in that age group are at least\ngetting some level of acne."},"246":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nMmhmm."},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"So, does it run in families?\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"249":{"dur":4,"text":"It does, definitely.\nGenetic predisposition for acne is a huge"},"254":{"dur":4,"text":"thing, especially the more severe acne.\nSo, if mom or dad had severe acne, you're"},"258":{"dur":5,"text":"at much greater risk to also have severe acne.\nOkay, so let's run through some really common"},"263":{"dur":4,"text":"questions that you get about acne when you\nhave people come into your office."},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"What's one of the most common ones?\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"268":{"dur":4,"text":"I think one of the most common ones is \"Why\nam I getting acne?\""},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"And the reason for that is just what we talked\nabout; the hormones are present, they're causing"},"276":{"dur":5,"text":"the skin to produce more oils, you're getting\nthose sticky skin cells that block the follicle,"},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"and then you have acne.\nA lot of them want to know, well, is it something"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm eating, is it something in my diet.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"Is it chocolate and high fat foods.\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"Right.\nIs it pizza, or you know."},"291":{"dur":5,"text":"Yeah, and all the studies that have been done\nso far have not shown any correlation with"},"297":{"dur":5,"text":"the food types we eat and in acne.\nSo, that's a thing that has not been proven."},"303":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I tell most patients that it's not actually\nbeen proven that it's what you're eating."},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"It could be, but there doesn't seem to be\nany cause and effect relationship at this"},"311":{"dur":5,"text":"time.\nAnd then, the other question we get a lot"},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"is \"What can I do about my acne at home?\"\nSo."},"320":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nThe store aisles are filled with different"},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"things that you can try.\nWe're going to talk about what sort of, you"},"326":{"dur":5,"text":"know, active ingredients we should look for.\nBut I've got another one: does stress make"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"your skin break out?\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"Oh boy, absolutely.\nYou see a lot of people, especially college"},"337":{"dur":5,"text":"age kids, come in, oh it's finals time, we're\nreally stressed out, and my acne's just exploding."},"343":{"dur":5,"text":"So, there's no doubt, in my mind at least,\nthat stress causes acne, so."},"348":{"dur":3,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nIs that because hormone levels change, due"},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"to stress, or...?\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"No, no one knows for sure, but that's probably\nexactly what it is."},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"When we get stressed out, our cortical steroid\nlevel goes up in our body."},"358":{"dur":5,"text":"And cortical steroids are known to cause acne,\nso that's exactly what, probably, the method"},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"is of stress induced acne, is the hormonal\nchanges that are going on."},"367":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this is probably another one you get:\ncan I pick and pop my pimples?"},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"We've all done it; admit it, you have, too.\nI know I have."},"376":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Leone:\nYeah."},"377":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nIt's a temptation."},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"Have you?\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"Oh yeah, yeah.\nIt's impossible when you see a pimple sitting"},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"there, you know, it's begging to be popped.\nAnd it's hard not to."},"385":{"dur":4,"text":"And the answer is you should try not to, because\nwhen you do squeeze and pop that pimple, if"},"390":{"dur":4,"text":"it pops inward or doesn't, you kwon, sometimes\nwe try to pop that pimple and, oh, it really"},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"got sore, it felt like a pop, but nothing\ncame out, what would happen is actually popped"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"inwards.\nAnd that's what the big cause of scarring"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"with the acne is.\nAnd so, you really want to try to stay away"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"from that as much as you can.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay.\nSo, sometimes, some people get maybe like,"},"407":{"dur":5,"text":"it's a real hard bump, usually along the jaw\nline, that is hard and large, but nothing"},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"comes out of it.\nWhat's that?"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. Leone:\nThat's just a deeper form of acne, so that's"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"more of the cystic type of acne we talked\nabout, which you can't pop, I mean, even if"},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"you tried, because it's just so deep, and\nit's painful and sore."},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"And those eventually, as we know, they usually\ngo away on their own."},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"Some do turn into permanent cysts, especially\nif you try to pop them, so that's another"},"431":{"dur":5,"text":"reason not to try to pick or fiddle with that\ndeeper cystic acne, because it can turn into"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"a long-term cyst, so.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"438":{"dur":6,"text":"Okay, so let's talk about just, you know,\nwhat sort of, if you start, you've got a kid"},"444":{"dur":4,"text":"that's got acne, you go to the drugstore and\nyou get some over-the-counter things, what"},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"are the most effective ingredients in these\ndifferent products that are effective for"},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"acne treatment?\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, there's a lot of over-the-counter products,\nand it's important to know which ones are"},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"really going to give you a bang for the buck,\nand which ones aren't."},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"The number one thing you can use over the\ncounter is something with benzoyl peroxide"},"463":{"dur":4,"text":"in there, and that's the single most effective\ningredient you can get over the counter."},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a lot of different washes you see\nout there, like exfoliating washes, all these"},"471":{"dur":4,"text":"hard scrubs that you can use, and those are\nactually counterproductive and actually can"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"cause more skin irritation and acne.\nSo, I tend to stay away from those."},"479":{"dur":5,"text":"There are some salicylic acid washes, a lot\nof good brands out there you could buy, and"},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"those are also somewhat effective, but the\nnumber one thing is a benzoyl peroxide type"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"of...\n>>Lori Casey:"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"And what does that actually do?\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"So, benzoyl peroxide is anti-bacterial, so\nit wipes out the bacterial portion of acne"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"we talked about, and it's also anti-inflammatory,\nso."},"498":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"So, why are some of those scrubs and things\ncounterproductive?"},"502":{"dur":3,"text":">>Dr. Leone:\nWell, they actually cause more skin irritation."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"And whenever your skin is irritated, it increases\nthe chance for acne."},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"So, you know, those very intense scrubs and\nwashes that, you know, a lot of people want"},"513":{"dur":4,"text":"to get these little mitts that you put on\nor these exfoliating washes, and they tell"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"me how they scrape their face.\nAnd I just cringe, and I'm like, oh no, don't"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"do that.\nIt just causes a lot of irritation; it doesn't"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"prevent acne at all, so.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay.\nAnd can the process of using all those things"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"over-dry your face and create more oil production?\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah.\nThat's not been proven, but it sure feels"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"like that sometimes, doesn't it?\nYou know, like you dry your face out, and"},"538":{"dur":4,"text":"then it kicks in the oil production.\nSo, I don't know if it does per say."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"There's really no studies out on that, but\nI would just generally stay away from that"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"because it's never proven to work.\nAnd you're just, you know, maybe psychologically"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"you think it's working, but it's actually\ncausing more harm than good."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nSo, can acne be contagious?"},"554":{"dur":4,"text":"Like, you think about it, if you have a couple\nteenagers at home, and someone grabs someone"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"else's washcloth that they use to wash their\nface; is that contagious?"},"562":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Leone:\nThat's a really good question."},"564":{"dur":5,"text":"Acne itself has never been shown to be contagious.\nNow, there are lesions that look like acne"},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"which are called folliculitis, which is infection\nof hair follicles with different types of"},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"bacteria not known to cause acne, definitely\nare contagious."},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"But that's a whole different type of diagnosis.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"That's for a different show.\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"That's for a different show.\nBut yeah, acne itself is not contagious."},"585":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"587":{"dur":4,"text":"So, at what point, you know, someone comes\ninto your office, you have a certain treatment"},"591":{"dur":5,"text":"plan that you go through; what do you do to\nassess somebody's acne condition, and then"},"597":{"dur":5,"text":"go from there, as far as recommending and,\nyou know, an over-the-counter or prescription?"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":">>Dr. Leone:\nYeah, there's a lot of factors that go into"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"that decision, including what the patient's\ncomfortable with and how bad the acne is."},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"But basically, as a baseline, we just kind\nof see how bad is that acne, and how bad is"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"the patient bothered by it, and what type\nof acne is it, because we talked about there"},"617":{"dur":4,"text":"being different types of acne, and they all\nrequire different types of treatment or a"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"different weapon from the arsenal of treatment\nof acne."},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if someone comes in with mild acne, and\nit's kind of that mild inflammatory acne,"},"629":{"dur":5,"text":"usually, we'll start off with a topical cream,\nusually something with a benzoyl peroxide"},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"and antibiotic in it.\nWe sometimes may add an antibiotic early on"},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"if the patient want to be more aggressive\nabout it, and then over time we'll try to"},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"get them off the antibiotic by mouth, and\njust use the topical cream for maintenance."},"645":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, again, it depends on the level of\nacne, and how bad it is, and how aggressive"},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"the patient wants to be about it.\nNow, if they have that comedonal acne, and"},"654":{"dur":5,"text":"it's not inflammatory, the topical medications\nwork much, much better than a medicine by"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"mouth for the comedonal type acne.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I had bad skin as a teenager, and I took\nAccutane."},"665":{"dur":5,"text":"And that was many, many years ago, and is\nthat still kind of a common prescription medication"},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"for acne?\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"It is, it's very common, and we use a fair\namount of it."},"675":{"dur":5,"text":"I myself used Accutane several years ago,\nand it really is a great, effective treatment."},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"It's gotten a lot of bad press in that last\n10 to 12 years or so, which is unfortunate."},"685":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nBecause of the risk of birth defects."},"688":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Leone:\nThat's one of the reasons, yeah."},"689":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nAnd something else, I can't remember what"},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"it was.\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"The other two big things were that it could\ncause you to be depressed and sometimes suicidal."},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"Then, there have been a lot of studies out\nthere that have shown that that is not a cause"},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"and effect relationship, but we still want\nto be careful when we prescribe Accutane for"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"that because of a few incidental reports about\nit."},"705":{"dur":5,"text":"There was another one saying it could cause\nyou to have inflammatory bowel disease, which"},"711":{"dur":6,"text":"is a bad situation where you have bloody diarrhea.\nAnd that's actually been proven in almost"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"all medical studies that Accutane does not\ncause that."},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"But unfortunately, some of the press got a\nhold of that, kind of ran with it, and people"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"have this big fear of Accutane now.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"So, what does that Accutane actually do to\ntreat acne?"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"How is it working?\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"That's a really good question.\nIt works in several different steps."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"The one step is that it reduces oil production.\nRemember we said..."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nI remember very dry skin."},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"This has been quite a few years ago, but I\nremember that."},"741":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Leone:\nYeah, the lips get really dry."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"But, and that's a temporary thing when you're\non the medicine."},"745":{"dur":4,"text":"But remember we talked about acne, and we\nsaid oil production, sticky cells, and bacteria"},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"are the three things you need for acne.\nAnd so, Accutane works by reducing oil production,"},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"and it does that somewhat permanently, not\nso much that we get dry skin, but reduces"},"758":{"dur":4,"text":"it to be a more normal level of oil production.\nAnd two, it changes our cells permanently,"},"762":{"dur":4,"text":"so they no longer are sticky and won't plug\nthose pores and follicles."},"767":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nSo, is there a certain amount of time that"},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"people are on something like that?\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, that's the other thing that, another\nadvantage of Accutane is you're on it for"},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"a finite amount of time.\nIt depends on your weight, so it's anywhere"},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"from five to seven months of treatment course,\nand then you're usually done with the course."},"784":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nCan the acne come back?"},"786":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Leone:\nIt definitely can come back."},"788":{"dur":5,"text":"Unfortunately, acne, as we all know, can be\ntough to treat, but 85% of the people that"},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"complete a course of Accutane have a long-term,\nI don't want to say cure, but a very good"},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"long-term, almost remission of acne, where\nit's not nearly as severe as it once was."},"802":{"dur":5,"text":"I mean, I myself was almost completely cured\nof my acne; I rarely get it anymore, so."},"807":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nSo, let's just step back a little bit."},"809":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm thinking about mom out there watching\nwith teenage boy or teenage girl, we'll pick"},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"on the boys a little bit.\nHow important is it to get your kids used"},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"to, if they've got acne, they've got that\nproblem, get them into the habit of washing"},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"their face?\nIs that critical to sort of prevent, or you"},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"know, helping the acne?\nYou know, with something to be washing it"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"every day?\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"Almost everyone that comes in talks about\nwashing their face, like, you know, I wash"},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"my face twice a day.\nYou know, am I using the right stuff."},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"And most people have pretty good hygiene,\nyou know."},"842":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if you're washing once or twice a day\nwith a gentle cleanser, you're doing good."},"847":{"dur":4,"text":"So, that's the number one thing with washing.\nBut yeah."},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, what did you ask me specifically\nabout..."},"854":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nSo, should they, how do you get them into,"},"856":{"dur":5,"text":"or is it, it is essential, you can't, it may\nnot get rid of the acne, but if you have a"},"862":{"dur":5,"text":"teenager that just never washes their face\nlike with a facial kind of cleanser, is acne"},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"going to get worse?\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"869":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes, it will.\nYeah."},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, you have to wash your face; you have\nto have good hygiene."},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"And the best time to wash are morning, and\nthen after any big physical activity, and"},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"before you go to bed.\nSo, those are the big times you want to wash,"},"879":{"dur":1,"text":"so.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm thinking of like, you know, if you've\ngot kids that play football, and they're wearing"},"882":{"dur":5,"text":"those football helmets, does that, can all\nthat sweat and all that stuff of a football"},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"helmet create more acne?\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"890":{"dur":3,"text":"Absolutely, absolutely.\nThe sweat can, and even more so is anything"},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"that's rubbing on your face; remember, we\ntalked about those scrubbing cleansers."},"896":{"dur":4,"text":"Anything that irritates your skin like repetitive\nfriction can cause acne, so you should wash"},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"your face if you could right before those\nactivities and right after."},"903":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:"},"904":{"dur":6,"text":"So, we've kind of focused on the teenagers;\nnow let's talk about adult acne."},"911":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not a fun thing to have to have a breakout,\nyou know, when you're 35 or 40 years old."},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"Why does it still keep occurring in adults?\n>>Dr. Leone:"},"919":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, that's another thing that the incidence\nof adult acne seems to be on the rise, and"},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"no one's really sure if it truly is on the\nrise, or if more people are just seeking treatment"},"927":{"dur":2,"text":"for it.\nBut again, we still have the hormones."},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, the reason it's worse when we're teenagers\nis because our hormones are really surging,"},"933":{"dur":5,"text":"but we still have those hormones until females\nhit post-menopausal time, but that's why you're"},"939":{"dur":3,"text":"still getting acne; you still have all the\nthings that cause acne: you still have the"},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"hormones, the oil production, and we always\nhave a little bit of that bacteria on our"},"946":{"dur":1,"text":"skin, so.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you see adult acne more in women than in\nmen?"},"950":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr.
