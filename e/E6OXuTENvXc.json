to\nmeasure stuff as proxies."},"2358":{"dur":2,"text":"You can do surveys of\npeople and their behavior."},"2360":{"dur":1,"text":"But if I ask you what\nyou're doing today"},"2362":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's a huge\noutbreak next year,"},"2364":{"dur":1,"text":"can't guarantee you're going\nto behave in the same way."},"2366":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that's\nsomething that"},"2368":{"dur":3,"text":"would be really interesting\nto try and understand actually"},"2371":{"dur":2,"text":"what people really do versus\nmaybe what they say they do"},"2374":{"dur":3,"text":"or what they think they do\nand how that has an effect,"},"2377":{"dur":2,"text":"because I think that's a\nbig gap in our understanding"},"2379":{"dur":1,"text":"of outbreaks certainly."},"2381":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: In the\nbeginning, you were"},"2382":{"dur":4,"text":"talking about the group that\nfound the hole in the lottery"},"2386":{"dur":2,"text":"system."},"2388":{"dur":2,"text":"Did you, while doing your\nresearch for the book, also"},"2391":{"dur":3,"text":"find some fault, some flaw\nin a system that you could"},"2394":{"dur":1,"text":"have potentially exploited?"},"2398":{"dur":2,"text":"ADAM KUCHARSKI:\nSo one example is,"},"2400":{"dur":2,"text":"if you remember back in January,\nthe UK National Lottery."},"2403":{"dur":2,"text":"So they introduced this rule."},"2405":{"dur":1,"text":"So they upped the\nnumber of combinations."},"2407":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think it was\npreviously about 9"},"2408":{"dur":1,"text":"million possible combinations,\nand they upped it"},"2410":{"dur":1,"text":"to 45 million."},"2412":{"dur":1,"text":"And unsurprisingly,\nthis meant they"},"2414":{"dur":2,"text":"didn't have any\nwinners for ages, which"},"2416":{"dur":1,"text":"is incredibly bad\npublicity, because actually,"},"2418":{"dur":1,"text":"for lotteries,\nthey like winners."},"2419":{"dur":1,"text":"It gives them people\nsmiling with checks."},"2420":{"dur":1,"text":"It's good."},"2422":{"dur":3,"text":"An interesting rule-- if it\nhit 50 million as a rollover,"},"2425":{"dur":2,"text":"they would redistribute\nthe prizes to lower tiers."},"2427":{"dur":2,"text":"So that was one thing\nactually I sort of chatted"},"2429":{"dur":2,"text":"with a few people about,\nof in that situation,"},"2432":{"dur":2,"text":"if you don't necessary have\nto win the jackpot to net 50"},"2434":{"dur":2,"text":"million, that gives you\na positive expectation"},"2437":{"dur":0,"text":"on the lottery."},"2438":{"dur":2,"text":"So actually, the value\nof a ticket on average"},"2440":{"dur":1,"text":"is worth more."},"2442":{"dur":1,"text":"But then there's\nthe issue of, is"},"2443":{"dur":3,"text":"expectation of good way\nof judging an investment?"},"2447":{"dur":3,"text":"Because you've got a tiny,\ntiny chance of winning a lot."},"2450":{"dur":2,"text":"And then again, from\nideas from the book,"},"2453":{"dur":2,"text":"if you actually looked at\nthat kind of investment,"},"2455":{"dur":1,"text":"if you looked it from\na utility point of view"},"2457":{"dur":2,"text":"rather than, if I played\nthis game an infinite number"},"2459":{"dur":3,"text":"of times, I might make a\nprofit, think of it of,"},"2463":{"dur":1,"text":"how much is this worth to me?"},"2464":{"dur":2,"text":"How big a bankroll do\nI need to make it worth"},"2466":{"dur":1,"text":"buying a 2-pound ticket."},"2467":{"dur":2,"text":"And actually, in that case,\nwith these kind of lottery"},"2470":{"dur":1,"text":"rollovers, buying\na single ticket"},"2472":{"dur":2,"text":"is only worth it if you're\na billionaire, basically,"},"2474":{"dur":2,"text":"from a utility point of view,\nwhich is not a great message."},"2477":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think there was a lot\nof focus on people saying,"},"2479":{"dur":1,"text":"well, you know,\nit's expected value."},"2480":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a great week to play."},"2481":{"dur":2,"text":"But the nuance of actually how\ndo you make those decisions,"},"2484":{"dur":2,"text":"I think, was a quite interesting\nthing to think about."},"2487":{"dur":3,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: You're talking\nabout obviously the strategies"},"2490":{"dur":2,"text":"for playing games\nand stuff but also"},"2492":{"dur":4,"text":"in relationship to banking,\ninvestments, and stuff."},"2496":{"dur":3,"text":"Obviously, that's an area where\ndifferent people are competing"},"2500":{"dur":1,"text":"with different strategies."},"2501":{"dur":2,"text":"But as soon as one strategy\nstarts to take hold,"},"2504":{"dur":1,"text":"then that changes the\nenvironment in which"},"2506":{"dur":1,"text":"the strategies are behaving."},"2507":{"dur":3,"text":"So are there any\ninteresting things"},"2510":{"dur":3,"text":"happening in trying to predict\nnot only when you introduce"},"2513":{"dur":1,"text":"a strategy and how\nit will do, but how"},"2515":{"dur":1,"text":"it will change the environment?"},"2516":{"dur":0,"text":"ADAM KUCHARSKI: Yeah,\nthat's a very good point."},"2517":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's one thing that\npeople are starting to work more"},"2520":{"dur":1,"text":"actively actually\nis-- I think there's"},"2521":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of focus on finance from\nan individual point of view."},"2524":{"dur":1,"text":"You've got a single\ninvestor, a single strategy."},"2525":{"dur":1,"text":"But of course, it's\nbasically an ecosystem."},"2527":{"dur":3,"text":"And a few people compare it\nto an evolutionary dynamic,"},"2530":{"dur":1,"text":"that if you come up\nwith a good strategy,"},"2532":{"dur":0,"text":"other people adopt it."},"2533":{"dur":1,"text":"And then it becomes\nless successful,"},"2535":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you have to kind\nof evolve what you do."},"2537":{"dur":4,"text":"And they're saying the\nbigger the advantage,"},"2541":{"dur":3,"text":"the quicker it's going to decay\nin terms of effectiveness,"},"2544":{"dur":1,"text":"because it'll be easier\nfor people to spot."},"2546":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think for these\nhigh-speed things in particular,"},"2549":{"dur":3,"text":"that time scale is quite\nshort, because if you speed up"},"2552":{"dur":2,"text":"what you're doing, you have such\na big edge over other people"},"2555":{"dur":2,"text":"that there's a big incentive\nfor them to come in."},"2558":{"dur":3,"text":"And in one case, for\nexample, the people"},"2561":{"dur":1,"text":"are building a\nhardwire from-- I don't"},"2562":{"dur":1,"text":"know if you heard about this--\nfrom London to New York,"},"2564":{"dur":2,"text":"underneath the flight path,\nbecause it would give them"},"2567":{"dur":3,"text":"a fraction of a second quicker\ninformation on the market."},"2570":{"dur":4,"text":"And building that cable\nis sufficiently valuable"},"2575":{"dur":1,"text":"to actually get that edge."},"2576":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think in\nparticular, as the speed"},"2577":{"dur":2,"text":"increases, that evolutionary\nprocess is increasing a lot."},"2580":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think there's a\nlot we don't understand."},"2582":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, you can take\nsome of the basic ideas"},"2583":{"dur":2,"text":"from ecology, about what happens\nwhen you put lots of people"},"2586":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the classical results\nactually from chaos theory"},"2589":{"dur":1,"text":"in the '70s was, if\nyou have something"},"2591":{"dur":1,"text":"following simple\nrules, it can do"},"2593":{"dur":1,"text":"very weird, complicated things."},"2594":{"dur":2,"text":"I think we're seeing similar\nthings in finance, that you"},"2596":{"dur":2,"text":"have a load of algorithms\nwritten with 10 lines of code"},"2599":{"dur":1,"text":"sitting together, and\nthey don't necessarily"},"2601":{"dur":1,"text":"do what you think they'd do."},"2602":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think that's quite an\ninteresting, important field,"},"2605":{"dur":1,"text":"but one that hasn't\nbeen fully explored."},"2606":{"dur":2,"text":"So it'll be nice to see\nwhat happens in the future."},"2609":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: Going back a bit\nto the disease outbreaks,"},"2612":{"dur":2,"text":"you mentioned that that data\nis sometimes not complete."},"2614":{"dur":2,"text":"So I was wondering, where do\nyou usually get that data?"},"2617":{"dur":1,"text":"And once you get\nthe results, how"},"2619":{"dur":1,"text":"does that data turn into action?"},"2621":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you just give it\nback to the government?"},"2623":{"dur":1,"text":"How does that work?"},"2625":{"dur":2,"text":"ADAM KUCHARSKI: So it varies\ndepending on the outbreak."},"2627":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, so with Ebola\nand these kind of things,"},"2630":{"dur":1,"text":"ideally you have\ndata on the cases"},"2632":{"dur":3,"text":"as they're being\ncollected at the time."},"2636":{"dur":2,"text":"We're working directly with\nagencies as well as WHO."},"2639":{"dur":1,"text":"You had Medecins Sans\nFrontieres, and these kind"},"2641":{"dur":3,"text":"of groups and actually kind\nof converting the data back"},"2644":{"dur":2,"text":"into a potential\nforecast for them."},"2647":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think with\nall these things,"},"2649":{"dur":1,"text":"it kind of works best if\nyou work with the people who"},"2651":{"dur":2,"text":"created the data, because they\nunderstand how it's collected,"},"2653":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's potentially useful."},"2655":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think one\nof the things that"},"2656":{"dur":2,"text":"was surprising with Ebola, for\nexample, is that in many cases,"},"2659":{"dur":1,"text":"people collecting\ndata in one district"},"2661":{"dur":2,"text":"didn't actually have the\ndata for the next district."},"2663":{"dur":2,"text":"So we had a situation\nwhere we were synthesizing"},"2665":{"dur":1,"text":"it and visualizing it\nand giving it back,"},"2667":{"dur":2,"text":"so they kind of knew what\nthe border picture was."},"2669":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's quite a\nbasic data analysis,"},"2672":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's essentially just\ncleaning it and visualizing it."},"2675":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think in some of\nthese situations, that's"},"2677":{"dur":1,"text":"almost the most important\nthing-- that you"},"2678":{"dur":1,"text":"can do fancy modeling\nin the long term."},"2680":{"dur":2,"text":"But really the fundamental\nthing on the day"},"2683":{"dur":1,"text":"is, what's the situation?"},"2684":{"dur":2,"text":"Is this the kind of idea of\nnowcasting for a disease?"},"2687":{"dur":1,"text":"You're always looking\ninto the past,"},"2688":{"dur":2,"text":"because you have\nthese delays in terms"},"2690":{"dur":3,"text":"of how the data come\nthrough and under-reporting"},"2694":{"dur":1,"text":"and those sort of stuff."},"2695":{"dur":2,"text":"So the data that comes\nin today might actually"},"2697":{"dur":1,"text":"be representing what\nhappened a few weeks ago."},"2699":{"dur":1,"text":"So even just making\nthose adjustments"},"2701":{"dur":1,"text":"and giving them back to\nthe people in the field"},"2703":{"dur":2,"text":"can be quite a useful exercise."},"2706":{"dur":3,"text":"AUDIENCE: You've discussed how\nin chess, Go, poker, roulette--"},"2710":{"dur":1,"text":"these kind of\ngames-- there's been"},"2711":{"dur":3,"text":"sound kind of breakthrough\nin which someone could"},"2714":{"dur":2,"text":"be pretty much all the others."},"2717":{"dur":3,"text":"What kind of game do you see\nnext, where this could happen,"},"2721":{"dur":2,"text":"where somebody could\ndevelop a new strategy"},"2724":{"dur":4,"text":"or get more data than anyone\nelse and beat the system?"},"2728":{"dur":2,"text":"ADAM KUCHARSKI: So which\ngame might fall next?"},"2730":{"dur":3,"text":"I think poker,\ncertainly no limits."},"2734":{"dur":1,"text":"We're kind of at that point."},"2735":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's a\ntournament last year,"},"2737":{"dur":1,"text":"where bots kind\nof played humans."},"2739":{"dur":1,"text":"And they played a vast\namount number of hands."},"2741":{"dur":2,"text":"The humans came out with a\nvery slightly smaller pot"},"2743":{"dur":0,"text":"on average."},"2744":{"dur":1,"text":"So naturally the\nresearcher said that"},"2745":{"dur":2,"text":"wasn't statistically\nsignificant and the human"},"2748":{"dur":1,"text":"said that they had won."},"2749":{"dur":1,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"2751":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think we're reaching\nthat point where,"},"2753":{"dur":3,"text":"if you talk to professionals,\nthese games are still safe."},"2756":{"dur":2,"text":"If you talk to the guys\nworking the algorithms,"},"2758":{"dur":1,"text":"it's only a matter of time."},"2759":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think it's\nparticularly interesting we"},"2761":{"dur":3,"text":"have these strong feelings about\ngames that are seen as an art."},"2765":{"dur":1,"text":"So a lot of these\npoker kind of games"},"2767":{"dur":4,"text":"are scene as very\nexperienced players"},"2771":{"dur":2,"text":"with intuition and instinct."},"2774":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that's their realm."},"2775":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's quite interesting as\ncomputers start to come into it"},"2777":{"dur":1,"text":"and challenge those
