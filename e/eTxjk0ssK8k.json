So I had this handwritten letter"},"673":{"dur":6,"text":"from Russell Long which described in summary\ndetail the relationship between Minnesota"},"679":{"dur":7,"text":"and Louisiana, going back to the Louisiana\nPurchase. So, when I met him I said, \"With"},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"all due respect, Mr. Chairman, I know I have\na lot to learn, I want to start with that"},"691":{"dur":4,"text":"letter you wrote me.

David Brooks in the"},"841":{"dur":6,"text":"New York Times said \"We have a crisis, we\nhave a morale crisis.
