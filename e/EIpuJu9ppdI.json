we"},"1878":{"dur":1,"text":"actually don't have to do like lighting"},"1880":{"dur":1,"text":"and every pics on the clouds we can do"},"1882":{"dur":2,"text":"lighting in every vertex in their

which"},"1974":{"dur":1,"text":"then gives you this really nice"},"1975":{"dur":2,"text":"volumetric effect so especially you can"},"1977":{"dur":2,"text":"see like when you're like you have a

fixed"},"2033":{"dur":2,"text":"fixed budget is fixed amount of hardware"},"2035":{"dur":1,"text":"that doesn't change the same for"},"2036":{"dur":1,"text":"everyone so our challenge is always that"},"2038":{"dur":2,"text":"jigsaw puzzle of trying to fit in well"},"2040":{"dur":2,"text":"how many probably got this big jigsaw"},"2043":{"dur":1,"text":"which is how much time we have to

how'd you get it to run fast enough"},"2058":{"dur":1,"text":"that it can fit in with our total budget"},"2060":{"dur":1,"text":"and that everything is coming out

not"},"2074":{"dur":1,"text":"just not just beautiful and a lot of"},"2076":{"dur":1,"text":"games do a really great job at this but"},"2078":{"dur":1,"text":"also how we manage to get it

carry"},"2085":{"dur":2,"text":"a second for you to hear when talking to"},"2088":{"dur":2,"text":"take out yeah-yeah rendering index card"},"2090":{"dur":1,"text":"like we look at these graphs

that"},"2099":{"dur":3,"text":"yeah and i guess like the advantage of"},"2102":{"dur":1,"text":"having assessment that there is so"},"2104":{"dur":1,"text":"dynamic is from an interesting point of"},"2106":{"dur":2,"text":"view yet you your is very flexible and"},"2108":{"dur":2,"text":"yeah and completely it's like that like"},"2111":{"dur":2,"text":"Andrew these goes we've got access to"},"2113":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of controlling the current way that"},"2115":{"dur":0,"text":"where the works"},"2116":{"dur":2,"text":"you also model the country's big

you"},"2124":{"dur":1,"text":"can kinda fine things within the world"},"2126":{"dur":1,"text":"that though the plan to go around and"},"2127":{"dur":2,"text":"avoid effectively so yeah it's just an"},"2130":{"dur":1,"text":"adaptable system lots of numbers that"},"2132":{"dur":2,"text":"you can just play with which is all"},"2134":{"dur":4,"text":"a good thing and the we're talking about"},"2138":{"dur":2,"text":"like like like you said in the"},"2141":{"dur":1,"text":"documentary late we often forget life"},"2143":{"dur":2,"text":"forget as an art form in itself like is"},"2146":{"dur":3,"text":"absolutely lighting and so was your"},"2149":{"dur":2,"text":"approach to essentially painting with"},"2151":{"dur":3,"text":"late in the game so right from the start"},"2155":{"dur":1,"text":"we need we knew we wanted it to kind of"},"2157":{"dur":2,"text":"like them kind of have that kind of a"},"2159":{"dur":2,"text":"rare kind of magic and kind of feel like"},"2161":{"dur":1,"text":"a rare game made for the modern agent"},"2163":{"dur":2,"text":"may be looking at the past records we"},"2165":{"dur":1,"text":"always knew we wanted something that was"},"2166":{"dur":2,"text":"can't quite kind of filmmaker stylistic"},"2169":{"dur":1,"text":"so really we kind of started looking at"},"2171":{"dur":2,"text":"right stop looking at it and color"},"2174":{"dur":2,"text":"scripts from like films like Disney"},"2176":{"dur":1,"text":"films are kind of like DreamWorks films"},"2178":{"dur":1,"text":"in the way that they approached kind

of"},"2184":{"dur":1,"text":"the lpv lighting system which we touched"},"2186":{"dur":1,"text":"on the way your account balance is like"},"2188":{"dur":1,"text":"through the environment without it kind"},"2190":{"dur":3,"text":"of feels like it it and it feels come"},"2193":{"dur":1,"text":"all kind of dead doesn't feel like the"},"2195":{"dur":2,"text":"lights really kind of washing through"},"2197":{"dur":2,"text":"the environment and so once we have that"},"2199":{"dur":1,"text":"system in place that's where you can"},"2201":{"dur":2,"text":"push more light into push more color"},"2203":{"dur":2,"text":"into the slot into those moments you can"},"2206":{"dur":2,"text":"be very naturalistic can approach to the"},"2208":{"dur":2,"text":"system i'm using the same system but it"},"2211":{"dur":2,"text":"is just that kind of like pushing the"},"2213":{"dur":1,"text":"oranges are pushing the Reds win it but"},"2215":{"dur":1,"text":"again it's down to the fact that all"},"2216":{"dur":1,"text":"these kind of numbers are available so"},"2218":{"dur":3,"text":"that 200 together and play with and just"},"2222":{"dur":1,"text":"move in is they just can't like this big"},"2223":{"dur":3,"text":"naughty web where you move one thing you"},"2226":{"dur":1,"text":"have to kinda just another five to"},"2228":{"dur":2,"text":"balance it all out but it just gives you"},"2230":{"dur":2,"text":"that kind of like that level of kind of"},"2232":{"dur":1,"text":"charm within the lighting and that's"},"2234":{"dur":2,"text":"that's kind of approach is always not"},"2236":{"dur":1,"text":"about catching realism it was about"},"2237":{"dur":2,"text":"catching color and emotion or your kind"},"2240":{"dur":1,"text":"of getting that kind of feeling across"},"2241":{"dur":2,"text":"there when people look at the horizon"},"2244":{"dur":1,"text":"and say that's an amazing sunset"},"2245":{"dur":1,"text":"that's what we know we've done the job"},"2247":{"dur":2,"text":"that we set out to do because that is if"},"2249":{"dur":1,"text":"we go after being realistic people have"},"2251":{"dur":1,"text":"gone all look so realistic rather than"},"2253":{"dur":2,"text":"just having that emotional response to"},"2255":{"dur":3,"text":"Jason realize them like in games at the"},"2258":{"dur":2,"text":"moment seems to be it's a very

all"},"2280":{"dur":3,"text":"always really good and I think it's just"},"2283":{"dur":1,"text":"kinda like picking where you where you"},"2285":{"dur":1,"text":"want to come out artistically take"},"2286":{"dur":3,"text":"something I think sent receives its all"},"2290":{"dur":2,"text":"about emotion that experience of Camelot"},"2292":{"dur":1,"text":"being with your friends in this kind

because once"},"2318":{"dur":1,"text":"you have all these kind of"},"2319":{"dur":3,"text":"physically-based aspects it when we can"},"2322":{"dur":1,"text":"then take them and we can play around"},"2324":{"dur":1,"text":"with him they just give us more tools"},"2326":{"dur":1,"text":"and our calf palliative doing"},"2327":{"dur":1,"text":"non-realistic things"},"2329":{"dur":2,"text":"yeah absolutely this is having all the"},"2331":{"dur":1,"text":"tools that to achieve it and then making"},"2332":{"dur":2,"text":"the artistic choices of how users you"},"2335":{"dur":3,"text":"yeah it's knocked out no it's yeah and"},"2338":{"dur":2,"text":"it's but as you say it's kinda we would"},"2341":{"dur":2,"text":"benefit from from all the great work"},"2343":{"dur":2,"text":"that either the other the engine team"},"2345":{"dur":2,"text":"done or other partners or other get all"},"2348":{"dur":1,"text":"the game she does that a lot against you"},"2349":{"dur":1,"text":"as a great public with the techniques"},"2351":{"dur":2,"text":"that use and various conferences and"},"2353":{"dur":2,"text":"things so yeah I'm even if a game that's"},"2356":{"dur":1,"text":"very different to what you would expect"},"2357":{"dur":2,"text":"in the real world it's still a lot of a"},"2359":{"dur":1,"text":"lot of hard work gone into to achieving"},"2361":{"dur":1,"text":"that effect was the case it can be a bit"},"2363":{"dur":1,"text":"yeah or even the same underlying texts"},"2365":{"dur":1,"text":"you think those two things which it"},"2367":{"dur":1,"text":"which we are getting a lot yes"},"2368":{"dur":1,"text":"yeah i was talking just LA today"},"2370":{"dur":2,"text":"actually about lake looking back at some"},"2373":{"dur":2,"text":"CG movies and and the stables that they"},"2375":{"dur":2,"text":"tend to go for and and and how quickly"},"2378":{"dur":3,"text":"sometimes some things date is simply to"},"2381":{"dur":2,"text":"realize i think really the mages doesn't"},"2383":{"dur":2,"text":"it yeah quite quickly quickly and it's"},"2385":{"dur":2,"text":"like a outcome is great obviously we're"},"2388":{"dur":1,"text":"going to less kind of timeless alright"},"2390":{"dur":1,"text":"well yeah that was a decision from the"},"2391":{"dur":1,"text":"start of wanting something because we've"},"2393":{"dur":0,"text":"always done that with"},"2394":{"dur":2,"text":"with road games is using tac-2 cannot"},"2396":{"dur":1,"text":"create a timeless look rather than"},"2397":{"dur":2,"text":"realism because you say it does this"},"2400":{"dur":1,"text":"date because you can achieve what you"},"2402":{"dur":2,"text":"can achieve that time flavia's can later"},"2404":{"dur":2,"text":"people have push technology found new"},"2406":{"dur":1,"text":"ways of doing things and it just moves"},"2408":{"dur":2,"text":"on there is more stylized work it just"},"2410":{"dur":2,"text":"it just ages better because its defining"},"2413":{"dur":1,"text":"is defining what is in that moment"},"2414":{"dur":1,"text":"rather than trying to chase something"},"2416":{"dur":2,"text":"that it can't quite do you yeah Cameron"},"2418":{"dur":2,"text":"I replayed do these the end of last year"},"2420":{"dur":1,"text":"and I know it looks a little

great"},"2426":{"dur":2,"text":"yeah if you watch toy story reason yeah"},"2428":{"dur":1,"text":"it's fun it's unbelievable"},"2430":{"dur":6,"text":"That's the first CGI movie and it is
