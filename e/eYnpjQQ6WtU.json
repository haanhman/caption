and\nlabel."},"164":{"dur":4,"text":"So I guess with that, let\u2019s go ahead and\nstart our tour here and show you guys how"},"168":{"dur":1,"text":"it\u2019s made."},"169":{"dur":4,"text":"So the first step to making a good Kombucha\nis of course using a good water."},"174":{"dur":6,"text":"Now they only use reverse osmosis system here\nto remove all the dissolve solids and minerals"},"180":{"dur":3,"text":"and all that stuff so you\u2019re going to get\nthe best quality Kombucha."},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"If you guys brew your own coffee, you guys\nthat are coffee connoisseurs, you won\u2019t"},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"just use tap water to brew your coffee, right?"},"190":{"dur":6,"text":"You\u2019re going to use a good filtered reverse-osmosis\nor distilled water even and then brew your"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"coffee with that because you\u2019re going to\nget much better flavors."},"199":{"dur":4,"text":"That\u2019s why they\u2019re doing it here, in addition\ndepending on the water source, Kombucha brewers"},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"probably use municipal water for the most\npart."},"207":{"dur":6,"text":"They may have fluoride, or things like chlorine\nadded, and that\u2019s why the reverse-osmosis,"},"213":{"dur":3,"text":"for the most part, removes all those things\nso that you don\u2019t have any contamination"},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"in the water and you\u2019re going to end up\nwith the highest-quality product."},"221":{"dur":6,"text":"The next step of making a good Kombucha is\nto make a nutrient-solution that\u2019s going"},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"to feed the Kombucha scoby, or Kombucha mother."},"231":{"dur":4,"text":"And how they do that is they take some of\nthe filtered reverse-osmosis water here and"},"236":{"dur":6,"text":"they turn on the boiler there that boils the\nwater, and they dispense the water into the"},"242":{"dur":7,"text":"stainless steel vessel that they brew the\nnutrient solution, which they\u2019re going to"},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"add a few ingredients to."},"252":{"dur":5,"text":"I want you guys to remember, they\u2019re not\njust making a tea, because whatever they\u2019re"},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"making in there is the nutrient solution."},"259":{"dur":6,"text":"What\u2019s going to happen is the Kombucha scoby\nis going to convert all those nutrients in"},"266":{"dur":4,"text":"there, including the sugar and the tea, into\nsomething entirely different."},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"This is like if you guys ferment your vegetables,\nif you\u2019ve eaten sauerkraut, you take the"},"274":{"dur":5,"text":"cabbage with the lactobacillus and you make\nthat into a sauerkraut."},"279":{"dur":4,"text":"And once you make the sauerkraut, it\u2019s no\nlonger the cabbage."},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"It\u2019s something different because it tastes\ntotally different, right?"},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"And that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing here."},"289":{"dur":4,"text":"So they\u2019re filling up the water and now\nwe\u2019re going to go ahead and add the sugar"},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"and also, the tea."},"295":{"dur":5,"text":"We\u2019ve got the boiling water, the next step\nis to add the sugar, and they\u2019re using an"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"organic cane sugar."},"303":{"dur":7,"text":"And once again, this cane sugar will get metabolized\nby the Kombucha culture so there\u2019ll be,"},"310":{"dur":5,"text":"if done properly, very little residual sugar\nin the final product."},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"Look out for places saying there\u2019s no sugar\nin there because if there\u2019s no sugar in"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"there, then it will probably taste horrible."},"322":{"dur":4,"text":"The other thing I have a big problem with\nin this day and age is certain companies will"},"326":{"dur":5,"text":"put there\u2019s this much sugar, and I know\nfor a fact there\u2019s gotta be more sugar than"},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"that."},"333":{"dur":4,"text":"The other thing that they do is they\u2019re\ngoing to start adding some tea in, but they"},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"first need to make sure the sugar is fully\ndissolved."},"340":{"dur":6,"text":"If you guys want to make your own Kombucha\nat home, you\u2019re basically going to use a"},"346":{"dur":6,"text":"ratio, one gallon of the water to one cup\nof sugar, and then we\u2019re going go to ahead"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"and add the tea."},"355":{"dur":6,"text":"So once the sugar\u2019s dissolved into solution,\nthen the tea will be added, and what\u2019s being"},"361":{"dur":5,"text":"added now is organic fair trade tea, and for\nthe home people out there wanting to brew"},"366":{"dur":14,"text":"it themselves, it\u2019s about five to six ounces\nof tea per gallon of water."},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"All stirred up to create a sweet tea."},"384":{"dur":4,"text":"Now I know some of you guys are thinking,\n\u201cJohn, I don\u2019t drink caffeine.\u201d"},"388":{"dur":4,"text":"I know there\u2019s caffeine in the black tea\nso yes, if you drink this it will be like"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"a sweet tea, like you guys from the South\nwho drink the sweet tea and yes, there\u2019s"},"396":{"dur":4,"text":"caffeine and sugar in the sweet teas, but\nthe magic of the Kombucha culture is that"},"401":{"dur":7,"text":"it takes the caffeine and the tea and sugar\nand turns it into something different."},"408":{"dur":7,"text":"The caffeine is cultured out and eaten, for\nlack of a better word, by the culture, because"},"416":{"dur":7,"text":"what it is is this: the teas have a high nitrogen\nlevel, and the Kombucha culture loves nitrogen."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"The caffeinated tea is high in nitrogen."},"426":{"dur":5,"text":"That basically is why this all works, making\nthe Kombucha with the tea and sugar."},"432":{"dur":5,"text":"So now that the Kombucha is brewing in the\nstainless steel vessel that you guys saw,"},"438":{"dur":5,"text":"next step is to put it into one of the fermentation\nvessels."},"443":{"dur":5,"text":"What Cory\u2019s doing now is cleaning out the\nprevious fermentation vessel because another"},"449":{"dur":5,"text":"thing that\u2019s very important, whether you\u2019re\nbuying Kombucha, or making it yourself, is"},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"sanitation and cleanliness."},"455":{"dur":6,"text":"If you\u2019re not sanitary, he\u2019s wearing gloves\nhere, he\u2019s being very careful not to bring"},"462":{"dur":5,"text":"and introduce different bacteria, dirt, and\nall this kind of stuff to the culture because"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"that\u2019ll mess it up."},"469":{"dur":6,"text":"He\u2019s cleaning up the fermentation vessel\nthat he\u2019ll now be brewing the new tea in"},"476":{"dur":5,"text":"and more importantly, I want to talk about\nthe fermentation vessel that he\u2019s using."},"481":{"dur":4,"text":"Here he uses a stainless steel vessel made\nin Italy."},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"This is of the highest quality stainless steel."},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"There\u2019s a lot of stainless steel coming\nout of China and I wonder if that\u2019s all"},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"stainless steel."},"495":{"dur":7,"text":"Some fermenters may use plastic or other materials,\nand if you guys are brewing at home, I would"},"502":{"dur":7,"text":"definitely recommend something solid, something\nlike glass or stoneware that has a finish"},"510":{"dur":6,"text":"on it, something like stainless steel, and\nnot use plastic because think about it, while"},"516":{"dur":5,"text":"the Kombucha is fermenting, it\u2019s acidic."},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"Acids will leech things out of plastic."},"523":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you\u2019re also buying Kombucha, you may\nalso want to ask the person making the Kombucha,"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"\u201cHey, what do you guys ferment in?\u201d"},"530":{"dur":6,"text":"Because the Kombucha is sitting in there for\nup to two weeks, depends on the climate, could"},"536":{"dur":6,"text":"be less, could be more, and they do full run\nbatches here, so they do a batch-kind Kombucha,"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"which is the kind I prefer to drink, and I\nwould recommend that\u2019s the kind you would"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"want to drink, for a few reasons."},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"There\u2019s continuous Kombucha and batch Kombucha."},"551":{"dur":5,"text":"Batch Kombucha, they basically run the batch\nin here until it\u2019s fully fermented, the"},"557":{"dur":5,"text":"sugars are at the lowest points, the caffeine\nis fermented out of the mixture, and that\u2019s"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"when they bottle it and sell it to you guys."},"565":{"dur":5,"text":"Continuous process Kombucha, they don\u2019t\nhave to clean the vessels out."},"570":{"dur":5,"text":"This is labor-intensive what they do here,\nbut basically they\u2019re adding fresh sugarized"},"575":{"dur":5,"text":"and caffeinated tea in and harvesting that\nas they go, so they have a lot more caffeine"},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"potentially and sugar in the mixture."},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"Now that the stainless steel fermentation\nvessel has been cleaned and sterilized, now"},"588":{"dur":5,"text":"we\u2019re going to take the tea that\u2019s been\nbrewing and has had time to cool properly,"},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"and put that in the fermentation vessel."},"597":{"dur":5,"text":"Got a nice stream going on right there and\nwhile this is happening, I want to let you"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"guys know it\u2019s very important to let the\ntea cool down properly because you do not"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"want to brew your Kombucha while it\u2019s too\nhot."},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"You\u2019re going to burn the culture."},"613":{"dur":5,"text":"The optimal temperature for Kombucha when\nbrewing is between 75 to 85 degrees and in"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"hotter temperatures, it can happen faster."},"620":{"dur":6,"text":"So if you\u2019re in a colder temperature, it\u2019s\ngoing to take longer for your Kombucha to"},"627":{"dur":6,"text":"fully ferment and get out that sugar, and\nthat\u2019s one of the goals that they\u2019re doing"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"here."},"634":{"dur":5,"text":"What\u2019s happening now is that the tea that\nwas freshly brewed, or what I want to term"},"639":{"dur":5,"text":"it as the nutrient solution, that\u2019s feeding\nthe Kombucha culture in there, they need to"},"645":{"dur":8,"text":"add the starter tea, and what the starter\ntea is is a fully fermented Kombucha that\u2019s"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"completed its whole cycle."},"655":{"dur":6,"text":"It\u2019s got all the sugar out and the caffeine\nout, and what it helps to do is help to jump"},"662":{"dur":6,"text":"start the newly brewed tea, number one, and\nmore importantly, number two, it helps to"},"668":{"dur":8,"text":"keep out the unwanted bacteria and other potential\npathogen like mold that can grow by lowering"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"the pH in there."},"678":{"dur":5,"text":"It looks like it\u2019s all filled up, and I\nthink we\u2019re going to start to brew, baby,"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"brew."},"685":{"dur":6,"text":"So after putting in the starter culture to\nonce again the pH correct, and a finished"},"691":{"dur":7,"text":"Kombucha should be in the pH range of 3.8\nto 3.2, which is an acid range, and once again,"},"699":{"dur":6,"text":"this is to prohibit the occurrence of microbes\nand mold and all this kind of stuff, undesirable"},"706":{"dur":5,"text":"ones and the thing is, I know you guys might\nbe thinking, \u201cJohn, Kombucha is acidic!\u201d"},"712":{"dur":5,"text":"And if you watch me for any amount of time\nyou know I recommend an alkaline, and the"},"718":{"dur":5,"text":"problem with most Americans today is they\u2019re\neating a very acidic diet, including animal"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"products, very acidifying on your body."},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"We want to have an alkaline condition."},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"And the thing to go is lemons, let me give\nyou a quick analogy."},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"Lemons are acidic when you eat them."},"735":{"dur":6,"text":"They\u2019re highly acidic, but overall they\u2019re\nalkalizing to your body, and that\u2019s the"},"742":{"dur":5,"text":"same thing with the Kombucha, it\u2019s alkalinizing,\nso it\u2019s a good thing."},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, do I recommend drinking Kombucha each\nand every day because it\u2019s alkalinizing?"},"751":{"dur":4,"text":"Well we\u2019ll talk about that in another video\nbut what they did just now was transfer the"},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"Kombucha mother over into the new batch."},"760":{"dur":5,"text":"The starter tea alone is not enough to get\nthis to ferment properly, and you will need"},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"a mother culture."},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"And one of the cool things I learned is that\nyou can eat your mother culture, if you\u2019re"},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"a cannibal."},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"Wait, you wouldn\u2019t be a cannibal if you\nwere eating the mother culture."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"I\u2019ve heard it doesn\u2019t taste like anything."},"776":{"dur":5,"text":"One day I hope to dry and freeze dry and flavor\nsome mother culture to see what it\u2019s tasting"},"781":{"dur":4,"text":"like, because I\u2019m sure it\u2019s definitely\nrich in benefits, much like the Kombucha."},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"What they\u2019re doing now is adding the mother\nculture."},"790":{"dur":6,"text":"They\u2019re putting a cloth over the top so\nthe Kombucha can breathe, yet not dirt, dust,"},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"or foreign particulates will get into the\nmixture."},"800":{"dur":4,"text":"So now that we\u2019ve got the freshly brewed\ntea, or nutrient solution, out there with"},"804":{"dur":5,"text":"the starter culture, then the mother went\nin, now this is pretty much how it looks."},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"I want you guys to pay attention."},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"This Kombucha mother, that\u2019s a model Kombucha\nmother."},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"It\u2019s a super model Kombucha model, this\nthing\u2019s hot."},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"Look at the curves on that Kombucha."},"820":{"dur":4,"text":"But any case, Kombucha mothers will look a\nlittle different."},"825":{"dur":5,"text":"If there\u2019s a lot of CO2 in the Kombucha\nit\u2019ll look a little disformed and all that"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of stuff, but it will still be alright."},"832":{"dur":5,"text":"Normally they don\u2019t open up the Kombucha\nmothers and expose it to air like this but"},"837":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019m doing this to show you guys for the\nvideo so you can see what it looks like."},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"We\u2019re going to go ahead and put the top\nback on and we\u2019re going to share with you"},"845":{"dur":6,"text":"guys how they test every brew while it\u2019s\nfermenting up next, and it\u2019s going to be"},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"fun for me."},"853":{"dur":3,"text":"Alright so here\u2019s something really cool\nthat I want to do for you guys, show you the"},"856":{"dur":6,"text":"differences between the sweet tea and the\nmixture that comes in versus the Kombucha"},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"that comes out, because there is a big difference."},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is a one that was just filled."},"867":{"dur":5,"text":"You saw Cory in the background with all the\nstuff he made, so we\u2019re going to tap out"},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"a little bit just to show you guys the color."},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"That kinda looks like pee."},"879":{"dur":5,"text":"This stuff is actually nice and yellow, fairly\ndark."},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"Now we\u2019re going to go ahead and look at\none that\u2019s been brewing for the appropriate"},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"amount of time."},"890":{"dur":5,"text":"So now they have a batch they\u2019ve actually\nfinished bottling earlier today here at Awaken"},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"Tea Kombucha."},"896":{"dur":5,"text":"That\u2019s totally finished, and once again\nhere\u2019s one that we just bottled up, looks"},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"like pee."},"903":{"dur":5,"text":"And now we\u2019re going to go ahead and tap\noff the finished one."},"909":{"dur":5,"text":"Wow, look at that man, it\u2019s a little bit\nfizzy in there and here\u2019s the difference,"},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"look at the difference on that."},"917":{"dur":1,"text":"Big significant difference."},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"What would you rather drink?"},"921":{"dur":4,"text":"The pee with the sugar and the caffeine, or\ndo you want to drink the finished Kombucha."},"925":{"dur":6,"text":"The finished Kombucha has the different properties\nthan the tea that\u2019s been brewing because"},"932":{"dur":8,"text":"the Kombucha mother, the big blob that you\nsaw at the top, basically feeds off the nitrogen,"},"941":{"dur":5,"text":"feeds off the caffeine, feeds off the sugars,\nand converts it into something entirely different."},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"This has two different strains of probiotics\nin there."},"950":{"dur":5,"text":"In addition it has live enzymes, provided\nyou have raw Kombucha like they\u2019re producing"},"955":{"dur":1,"text":"here."},"956":{"dur":5,"text":"It has not been pasteurized, it also has B\nvitamins, it also has beneficial yeast, which"},"961":{"dur":2,"text":"we\u2019ll talk more about in just a little bit."},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"It also has different kinds of acids, which\nare also of course amino acids, which are"},"968":{"dur":6,"text":"the building blocks of protein, lactic acid,\ngluconic acid, I mean this stuff is really"},"975":{"dur":1,"text":"healthy and good for you."},"976":{"dur":4,"text":"The way I like to use Kombucha, once again,\nI like to use it as a supplement."},"981":{"dur":8,"text":"I\u2019d much rather drink a Kombucha than take\nwhite powder capsules for my beneficial probiotics"},"989":{"dur":2,"text":"because this is more of a real whole food."},"992":{"dur":6,"text":"It also has more of a spectrum of nutrients\nbesides just the beneficial bacteria."},"999":{"dur":4,"text":"It also has beneficial yeasts, as well as\nthe B vitamins."},"1003":{"dur":6,"text":"Alright, let\u2019s go ahead and taste this original,\nunflavored version of the Kombucha that they"},"1009":{"dur":3,"text":"offer here."},"1013":{"dur":5,"text":"I taste very little sweetness."},"1018":{"dur":7,"text":"I taste the tartness of some of that tea,\nbut normally they don\u2019t sell it like the"},"1025":{"dur":1,"text":"original flavor."},"1026":{"dur":2,"text":"They actually flavor it up, and that\u2019s one\nof the cool things they\u2019re doing here."},"1029":{"dur":8,"text":"They\u2019re creating all kinds of unique flavors\nusing local ingredients to make this taste"},"1038":{"dur":3,"text":"better but also add additional nutrients."},"1041":{"dur":7,"text":"Now one of the things that many Kombucha brewers\ndo is they add flavors before they brew the"},"1049":{"dur":3,"text":"tea, and then the flavoring is actually brewing\nin there."},"1053":{"dur":5,"text":"They make unflavored tea and add the flavors\nin later, which in my opinion is a much more"},"1058":{"dur":5,"text":"beneficial way to do it because you\u2019re culturing\nthe sugars and not the fruit sugars or the"},"1064":{"dur":5,"text":"other flavoring agents, and you\u2019re going\nto get undiluted flavors and nutrients in"},"1069":{"dur":1,"text":"the final end product."},"1071":{"dur":5,"text":"So let\u2019s see how they make and use natural\ningredients to make some of the flavors they"},"1076":{"dur":3,"text":"offer here at Awaken Tea Kombucha."},"1080":{"dur":5,"text":"So next I\u2019m going to share with you guys\nhow they add the flavoring into the Awake"},"1085":{"dur":6,"text":"Tea Kombucha, and this is one of the reasons\nwhy I\u2019m here today, because all Kombucha"},"1091":{"dur":2,"text":"makers do not do their flavorings like

and drinking his own Kombucha for the\nlast twelve years."},"1660":{"dur":3,"text":"So Cory, the first question I want to ask\nyou is, for the viewers that don\u2019t exactly"},"1664":{"dur":3,"text":"know what Kombucha is, what is Kombucha anyways?"},"1667":{"dur":4,"text":"CORY: Kombucha is, in its simplest definition,\na fermented tea."},"1672":{"dur":8,"text":"It originated in parts of China and Russia\nand so the Kombucha is referencing the type"},"1681":{"dur":5,"text":"of culture that you\u2019re fermenting with,\nand you\u2019re feeding it the tea and the sugar."},"1686":{"dur":4,"text":"JOHN: Okay, so I covered this earlier in this\nvideo, but in case you guys missed it, is"},"1691":{"dur":4,"text":"there sugar in the final product, and is there\ncaffeine in the final product?"},"1696":{"dur":5,"text":"CORY: So, there isn\u2019t a straightforward\nanswer with that because that\u2019s all dependent"},"1702":{"dur":7,"text":"on the person that\u2019s making it, or the manufacturer\nthat is making it for you."},"1710":{"dur":8,"text":"For us, we\u2019ve always strived to produce\na Kombucha that is very low in sugar residuals"},"1718":{"dur":6,"text":"and the other thing is, for me personally,\nI can\u2019t do caffeine at all anymore in my"},"1724":{"dur":4,"text":"diet, and the same has gone for my wife as\nwell."},"1729":{"dur":5,"text":"So, for us, in our product, what we give to\nour customers is there are very trace amounts"},"1735":{"dur":4,"text":"of caffeine that\u2019s left and very low sugar\nresiduals."},"1739":{"dur":1,"text":"JOHN: So, here\u2019s another questions."},"1741":{"dur":4,"text":"Cory, do you need to add the sugars to make\nthe Kombucha?"},"1745":{"dur":3,"text":"Could you do it sugar-free or anything like\nthat?"},"1749":{"dur":5,"text":"CORY: One of the things John was talking about\nin the video was that the sugar and the tea"},"1755":{"dur":2,"text":"make up the nutrient solution."},"1758":{"dur":7,"text":"So, there are some other substitutes that\nyou could use, like honey, for example, some"},"1765":{"dur":7,"text":"home brewers that might have access to locally\nmade honey, but you don\u2019t want to use raw"},"1772":{"dur":7,"text":"honey, for example, because you\u2019re introducing\nother wild bacteria strains that are going"},"1780":{"dur":1,"text":"to battle with the Kombucha."},"1781":{"dur":10,"text":"So we use an organic cane sugar in all our\nKombucha batches, but stevia or some other"},"1792":{"dur":4,"text":"sweetener substitute would not be acceptable\nbecause it\u2019s not a fermentable sugar."},"1796":{"dur":4,"text":"JOHN: So another question I have for you Cory,\nit\u2019s been on my mind so much because you"},"1801":{"dur":6,"text":"always hear about the Kombucha scoby or the\nKombucha mother or the Kombucha culture, whatever"},"1807":{"dur":6,"text":"you want to call it, some people say it\u2019s\na bacteria, some people say it\u2019s a fungus,"},"1813":{"dur":4,"text":"some people say it\u2019s a mushroom, some people\ndon\u2019t know what it is."},"1817":{"dur":5,"text":"So, from a twelve plus brewer and drinker\nyourself, what is it man?"},"1822":{"dur":2,"text":"CORY: What is it?"},"1825":{"dur":8,"text":"Technically, the closest relative that the\nKombucha culture has is to the lichen."},"1834":{"dur":5,"text":"It\u2019s kind of a unique family of its own."},"1839":{"dur":8,"text":"The acronym for SCOBY as we say is a symbiotic\ncolony of bacteria and yeast, so a lot of"},"1847":{"dur":3,"text":"people will say it\u2019s a mushroom."},"1851":{"dur":9,"text":"Some people refer to it as a UFO, because\nit has this very unidentifiable floating object"},"1860":{"dur":1,"text":"that sits on the surface."},"1862":{"dur":6,"text":"But the science tells us that it\u2019s closest\nrelated to a lichen, if that means anything"},"1869":{"dur":1,"text":"to you."},"1870":{"dur":4,"text":"JOHN: Why did you start to drink Kombucha\nin the first place?"},"1874":{"dur":7,"text":"CORY: The first introduction I had to it was\nliving in Alaska and I came from a coffee"},"1882":{"dur":1,"text":"culture."},"1883":{"dur":6,"text":"Growing up in the Pacific Northwest, I would\nyearn for that cup of coffee first thing in"},"1889":{"dur":6,"text":"the morning, and it never really satisfied\nme because I would get these jitters."},"1895":{"dur":6,"text":"And to this day, I\u2019ve pretty much stepped\ncompletely away from caffeine altogether because"},"1901":{"dur":10,"text":"it fed my anxiety, and panic attacks that\nI had, so I had to steer away from that altogether."},"1912":{"dur":5,"text":"But it really was how, the clarity that I\nhad when I would drink it first thing in the"},"1917":{"dur":5,"text":"morning was a better feeling than I had from\nany cup of coffee."},"1922":{"dur":4,"text":"JOHN: Wow, so I definitely want to encourage\nyou guys to get off the coffee."},"1927":{"dur":2,"text":"I do not think it\u2019s a good thing with the\ncaffeine."},"1930":{"dur":5,"text":"Once again, while they are using the tea leaves\nin the Kombucha that does have the caffeine,"},"1935":{"dur":4,"text":"it\u2019s basically eaten up by the Kombucha\nculture."},"1940":{"dur":5,"text":"And then you\u2019re getting some of the beneficial\nantioxidant properties of that green tea."},"1945":{"dur":3,"text":"The next question I have for you Cory is why\ndid you end up starting the Kombucha business"},"1948":{"dur":5,"text":"to bring this and share this Kombucha with\nthe community?"},"1953":{"dur":5,"text":"CORY: So, one of our values in our company\nis that we\u2019re community-driven."},"1959":{"dur":7,"text":"And so, when we had an idea of manufacturing,\nthere\u2019s a lot of responsibility that goes"},"1966":{"dur":7,"text":"with putting food out into the public and\nwhen we looked at the Kombucha industry, at"},"1974":{"dur":6,"text":"least locally, it was very lacking, and there\nreally were only a few national brands that"},"1980":{"dur":3,"text":"were even available at all."},"1983":{"dur":8,"text":"We felt like there was a real void in what\npeople had as an option to drink Kombucha."},"1992":{"dur":4,"text":"What there was, we felt like people were getting\nshortchanged."},"1997":{"dur":7,"text":"We really wanted to provide a product that\ncould find that balance of being very nutrient-dense"},"2004":{"dur":4,"text":"and beneficial while maintaining a great and\nfun flavor profile."},"2009":{"dur":3,"text":"JOHN: So Cory, what were some of the things\nthat helped it was of the Kombucha."},"2012":{"dur":7,"text":"CORY: So the quick breakdown of what we communicate\nto our customers is, because people ask this"},"2019":{"dur":4,"text":"all the time, like what is Kombucha and why\ndo I need it?"},"2024":{"dur":6,"text":"There are a couple of strains of probiotics\nif you\u2019re wanting additional probiotics"},"2031":{"dur":6,"text":"in your diet, but one of the most unique things\nthat I try to let people know is that there\u2019s"},"2038":{"dur":6,"text":"a long list of healthy acids that we don\u2019t\nget in the foods that we really eat."},"2044":{"dur":6,"text":"It\u2019s not stuff our body readily produces,\nand John touched on it earlier like the amino"},"2051":{"dur":7,"text":"acids, the building blocks of proteins that\nhelp us rebuild muscle tissues and things"},"2058":{"dur":1,"text":"like that."},"2059":{"dur":4,"text":"There\u2019s lactic acid, that helps to prevent\nthe growth of bad bacteria."},"2064":{"dur":6,"text":"There\u2019s acetic acid and gluconic acid, both\nof which help to neutralize pH."},"2071":{"dur":8,"text":"You also talked about earlier living a life\nwhere you\u2019re eating foods that are alkalizing"},"2079":{"dur":7,"text":"to the body, so we love breaking that misconception\nbecause Kombucha is technically an acidic"},"2087":{"dur":7,"text":"beverage, but those healthy acids that are\nin it really help alkalize and neutralize"},"2095":{"dur":1,"text":"your pH."},"2096":{"dur":5,"text":"JOHN: Wow, I mean I like to drink Kombucha\nsometimes, especially because it\u2019s alkalizing,"},"2101":{"dur":4,"text":"and that\u2019s just one of the reasons that\nI like to drink Kombucha, personally, of course."},"2106":{"dur":3,"text":"Another reason is the beneficial probiotics\nand also the beneficial yeasts, so let\u2019s"},"2110":{"dur":1,"text":"talk about that Cory."},"2112":{"dur":3,"text":"I know some people out there watching this\nmay have candida issues and they\u2019re scared"},"2116":{"dur":4,"text":"of the Kombucha because if I drink it I\u2019m\ngonna get more of the candida outgrowth, so"},"2120":{"dur":7,"text":"tell me what you know about the yeast and\nwill drinking Kombucha promote more candidiasis?"},"2127":{"dur":9,"text":"CORY: So we do get that question a lot because\nthere is sugar in Kombucha and for those that"},"2137":{"dur":7,"text":"have suffered with candida, that\u2019s generally\nthe first thing that their doctor, their naturopath"},"2145":{"dur":2,"text":"will tell them: avoid all sugars."},"2148":{"dur":1,"text":"And it\u2019s right."},"2149":{"dur":10,"text":"Candida is basically an imbalance of unhealthy\nyeast in the system, and so does Kombucha"},"2160":{"dur":5,"text":"feed that and help explode all those unhealthy\nyeasts?"},"2165":{"dur":7,"text":"Again, it depends on how much sugar might\nbe left over in the Kombucha, and it\u2019s dependent"},"2172":{"dur":4,"text":"on a lot of factors, and who\u2019s making it."},"2177":{"dur":6,"text":"One of our struggles is every batch of Kombucha\nis going to be slightly different."},"2184":{"dur":6,"text":"It\u2019s a natural fermentation process, and\nthere\u2019s different things, it\u2019s a craft"},"2191":{"dur":5,"text":"that I have developed in my ten years plus\nof brewing, where we try to get as consistent"},"2196":{"dur":6,"text":"of a product as possible and still have tasty\nflavors with the low sugar residuals."},"2203":{"dur":7,"text":"But, there are other beneficial yeasts that\nare in Kombucha that will help go up against"},"2211":{"dur":2,"text":"things like candida."},"2213":{"dur":5,"text":"JOHN: Based on the research I\u2019ve done about\nprobiotics, which not only includes healthy"},"2218":{"dur":4,"text":"bacteria which is often talked about, there\u2019s\nalso healthy yeast, and we need to have this"},"2222":{"dur":6,"text":"balance in our gut because based on my research\nonce again they play a significant portion"},"2229":{"dur":5,"text":"and part in our immune system but more importantly,\nin our digestion."},"2234":{"dur":5,"text":"So the next question I have for you Cory is,\nare all Kombuchas created equal because you\u2019re"},"2240":{"dur":5,"text":"talking about sugar content and I\u2019ve tried\nmany Kombuchas all over the place when

mean I think the simple answer is\nno, just as we look at anything in the food"},"2265":{"dur":8,"text":"industry is an orange juice concentrate that\u2019s\nin the freezer section the same as

organic\ncane sugar, but the actual brewing process"},"2428":{"dur":5,"text":"that we go through as John was showing earlier\nthrough the fermentation is that it really"},"2434":{"dur":2,"text":"is still a raw product."},"2436":{"dur":5,"text":"There\u2019s no pasteurization that we do to\ncontrol that."},"2442":{"dur":5,"text":"JOHN: So next Cory I want to talk to you about\nthe Kombucha a

like the Kombucha I tried here\nis actually pretty low on the fizz count,"},"2591":{"dur":6,"text":"the freshly bottled stuff you saw me bottle\nup and take a drink out of, so let\u2019s talk"},"2598":{"dur":1,"text":"about that."},"2599":{"dur":4,"text":"Do some companies add carbonation to their\nKombuchas and is this natural, and do you"},"2603":{"dur":1,"text":"do it here?"},"2605":{"dur":8,"text":"CORY: Our bottled Kombucha, we try to keep\nthe most traditional."},"2613":{"dur":7,"text":"Carbonation is certainly a cultural thing;\nin the United States, we have this fixation"},"2620":{"dur":2,"text":"or this obsession with bubbles in our drink."},"2623":{"dur":8,"text":"If you go other places in the world, fizzy\nwater would be appalling, and so it becomes"},"2631":{"dur":8,"text":"a preference, and so we\u2019ve seen that trend\nin Kombucha manufacturing that is producing"},"2639":{"dur":1,"text":"a really fizzy Kombucha."},"2641":{"dur":7,"text":"There are a couple of ways you can get extra\nbubbles, and there is a mild amount of carbonation"},"2648":{"dur":6,"text":"just in the initial fermentation process,\nbut the things that other manufacturers are"},"2655":{"dur":7,"text":"doing, and it\u2019s a choice, I think it\u2019s\nwhat a lot of consumers want, maybe they\u2019re"},"2662":{"dur":5,"text":"coming from a background of drinking soda\ndaily, so they\u2019re used to all that carbonation,"},"2668":{"dur":7,"text":"but forced carbonation is a method where you\u2019re\nadding food-grade carbon dioxide into the"},"2675":{"dur":3,"text":"liquid, so you\u2019re getting extra bubbles\nthat way."},"2679":{"dur":7,"text":"So virtually any Kombucha that\u2019s sold on\ntap, including our Kombucha, the carbon dioxide"},"2686":{"dur":5,"text":"is blending with the liquid, and is more or\nless going to create an artificial fizz to"},"2692":{"dur":1,"text":"it."},"2693":{"dur":6,"text":"The other way that you might get additional\ncarbonation is a method that we don\u2019t personally"},"2700":{"dur":7,"text":"practice, but it\u2019s called secondary fermentation,\nor bottle fermentation, where you\u2019ll take"},"2708":{"dur":5,"text":"the Kombucha, you\u2019ll put it in the bottle,\nand you might add more fruit juice that has"},"2713":{"dur":5,"text":"additional sugars, and those sugars are going\nto convert, and they\u2019re going to continue"},"2718":{"dur":2,"text":"to ferment at room temperature."},"2721":{"dur":5,"text":"You\u2019re going to create more bubbles that\nway."},"2726":{"dur":5,"text":"The hard thing for us as a commercial manufacturer\nis that it\u2019s really hard to control what"},"2732":{"dur":6,"text":"the alcohol levels do at that secondary fermentation\nbecause you\u2019re adding more sugars and there\u2019s"},"2738":{"dur":5,"text":"already an abundance of those healthy yeasts,\nso our bottled product we definitely try to"},"2744":{"dur":2,"text":"keep it as natural as possible."},"2747":{"dur":7,"text":"And then we do with some things with our Kombucha\non tap to minimize some of the forced carbonation,"},"2754":{"dur":5,"text":"but absolutely Kombucha on tap will have some\nforced carbonation with that method."},"2760":{"dur":4,"text":"JOHN: I want to encourage you guys to drink\nlow-carbonated Kombucha."},"2764":{"dur":6,"text":"I just think it\u2019s healthier because we don\u2019t\nhave a

stuff"},"2776":{"dur":1,"text":"process."},"2777":{"dur":3,"text":"The next question I want to ask you Cory is\nregarding the organics."},"2781":{"dur":6,"text":"So I know you guys use organic ingredients,\nsome fair trade ingredients, so tell me more"},"2787":{"dur":2,"text":"about your choice to do this."},"2790":{"dur":8,"text":"CORY: Well, there\u2019s, as a manufacturer,\nwe\u2019re a

trade\ncertificate just because that\u2019s what we"},"2839":{"dur":4,"text":"feel is our responsibility to the industry\nthat we\u2019re in."},"2843":{"dur":5,"text":"JOHN: So besides using organic ingredients,\nthe Awaken Tea Kombucha company is also a"},"2848":{"dur":3,"text":"sustainable company, probably one of the most\nsustainable Kombucha companies that I\u2019ve"},"2852":{"dur":1,"text":"ever seen."},"2853":{"dur":2,"text":"They not only use the reusable bottles that\nyou guys saw earlier."},"2856":{"dur":6,"text":"They actually have reusable labels on the\nbottle that they use time after time, so Cory,"},"2862":{"dur":4,"text":"what\u2019s the decision behind the whole sustainability\nof your company?"},"2866":{"dur":8,"text":"CORY: For us, living on Maui, we have to import\nvirtually everything that goes into our manufacturing"},"2874":{"dur":4,"text":"so the glass bottles, if we\u2019re going to\nhave to import, we want to make sure that"},"2879":{"dur":6,"text":"they\u2019re a quality vessel that is not only\ngoing to display our product at its best but"},"2885":{"dur":7,"text":"also be durable and also be rewashed and used\nover and over again."},"2893":{"dur":5,"text":"We are, according to our state health department,\nwe are one of the only companies in the state"},"2898":{"dur":6,"text":"of Hawaii that has any reusable bottle program,\nwhich is kind of hard to believe, but we had"},"2905":{"dur":6,"text":"to convince them that we could go through\na multistep process of removing food residual"},"2911":{"dur":7,"text":"sanitizing the bottles and presenting them\nas new when we go to our packaging."},"2919":{"dur":3,"text":"The labels that we use was on the same topic."},"2923":{"dur":6,"text":"We want to have something that is still going\nto look good and display our brand but something"},"2929":{"dur":2,"text":"that can be used over and over."},"2932":{"dur":6,"text":"The labels, they cost us more up front, but\nif we\u2019re able to reuse them over and over"},"2938":{"dur":2,"text":"again, for us it\u2019s worth it."},"2941":{"dur":4,"text":"JOHN: I want to encourage you guys out there\nto reuse instead of recycle no matter what"},"2946":{"dur":1,"text":"you\u2019re bringing into your home."},"2947":{"dur":6,"text":"You\u2019re buying to reuse it before you ever\nrecycle it, and that\u2019s literally what they\u2019re"},"2954":{"dur":1,"text":"doing here."},"2955":{"dur":4,"text":"So one of the techniques I got to share with\nyou guys earlier on how they produce the Kombucha"},"2959":{"dur":2,"text":"here is that they use a batch technique."},"2961":{"dur":5,"text":"But besides just a standard batch technique\nthere\u2019s also a continuous technique of manufacturing"},"2967":{"dur":1,"text":"or making the Kombucha."},"2968":{"dur":3,"text":"So Cory, do you want to explain some of the\ndifferences between the two techniques and"},"2972":{"dur":4,"text":"maybe one why might want to choose one over\nthe other one?"},"2976":{"dur":8,"text":"CORY: So we use a batch fermentation technique,\nwhich is more of traditional approach to Kombucha,"},"2985":{"dur":7,"text":"and the reason it is is you\u2019re putting in\nyour nutrient solution of sugar and tea is"},"2992":{"dur":8,"text":"that, you\u2019re giving your batch that entire\ncycle for the Kombucha to absorb and metabolize"},"3001":{"dur":6,"text":"everything in it, so you\u2019re getting a more\nconsistent batch when you\u2019re all done."},"3007":{"dur":5,"text":"Most of the sugars are going to be absorbed\nif you\u2019re doing it properly, and as well"},"3013":{"dur":2,"text":"the caffeine should be eaten up."},"3016":{"dur":7,"text":"In a continuous brew situation, a lot of home\nbrewers adopted this method and it\u2019s something"},"3023":{"dur":6,"text":"that I try to educate people on the difference\nin it, because a continuous brew is basically\u2026so"},"3030":{"dur":6,"text":"you have a two gallon batch that you\u2019re\nbrewing at home, and you bottle a gallon,"},"3037":{"dur":7,"text":"and you replace that gallon with your sweet\ntea or your nutrient solution."},"3044":{"dur":9,"text":"That sweet tea is going to ferment quicker\nwith the more acidic, already fermented Kombucha,"},"3053":{"dur":5,"text":"and so you\u2019ll have ready to drink Kombucha\nquicker, but within the batch that you\u2019ve"},"3059":{"dur":6,"text":"now created, there\u2019s going to be different\nlevels and so it becomes a completely different"},"3065":{"dur":4,"text":"method to fermenting that\u2019s really hard\nto get a consistent approach."},"3070":{"dur":7,"text":"I know for home brewers it\u2019s become a very\npopular method just because of its convenience,"},"3077":{"dur":5,"text":"because you can have a vessel that has a spout\nand draw your bottles out and replace it."},"3082":{"dur":6,"text":"So you always have Kombucha on demand but\nfor us, and for our consistency, the batch"},"3089":{"dur":3,"text":"is a little more work but we get the most\nconsistent results."},"3093":{"dur":4,"text":"JOHN: I definitely want to encourage you guys\nto do the batch method because we want to"},"3097":{"dur":1,"text":"burn off all that sugar."},"3099":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019m not a fan of using any refined sugar\nproducts."},"3102":{"dur":4,"text":"Of course I like here in Hawaii drinking the\nsugar cane juice, which is basically fresh"},"3107":{"dur":5,"text":"sugar cane juiced all raw and it actually\nferments quite quickly if you leave it sitting"},"3112":{"dur":4,"text":"out, even if you buy it and it\u2019s sitting\nfor five days it\u2019s gone bad already because"},"3117":{"dur":1,"text":"it\u2019s going to ferment."},"3119":{"dur":6,"text":"But once the refined sugar in the Kombucha\nis fully fermented, like they do here, I don\u2019t"},"3125":{"dur":5,"text":"have a super huge problem drinking it especially\nbecause for me, the Kombucha especially the"},"3131":{"dur":6,"text":"way it\u2019s produced here, has some beneficial\neffects that I desire."},"3137":{"dur":6,"text":"So the next question I have for you Cory is\nwhy does every batch of Kombucha taste a little"},"3143":{"dur":1,"text":"bit different?"},"3144":{"dur":3,"text":"I know some of you guys bought the same brand,\nwhether it\u2019s this brand or that brand, same"},"3148":{"dur":4,"text":"brand, same flavor, and sometimes it tastes\nless fizzy, more fizzy, less sweet, more sweet,"},"3153":{"dur":1,"text":"a little bit different."},"3154":{"dur":1,"text":"What\u2019s up with that?"},"3156":{"dur":8,"text":"CORY: So obviously Kombucha, it\u2019s a natural\nfermented product and so with every batch"},"3165":{"dur":8,"text":"that we have here, there\u2019s going to be slightly\ndifferent levels of bacteria and yeast and"},"3174":{"dur":7,"text":"even just a couple degree temperature difference\ncan play a role in what the final output is"},"3181":{"dur":1,"text":"going."},"3182":{"dur":8,"text":"And there\u2019s over a hundred years of documented\nresearch and Kombucha and its proper techniques"},"3190":{"dur":7,"text":"of brewing and we hear that all the time in\nour textbooks and our research is that there\u2019s,"},"3197":{"dur":6,"text":"I would personally be skeptical if someone\nwas providing a bottle of Kombucha that is"},"3204":{"dur":2,"text":"nearly exactly the same every time."},"3207":{"dur":4,"text":"JOHN: Cool, so let\u2019s talk about that because\nI know some bottles of Kombucha in the back,"},"3212":{"dur":2,"text":"everyone\u2019s taught to read ingredient labels."},"3215":{"dur":3,"text":"And one of the things I want to teach you\nguys is to eat food that doesn\u2019t have ingredient"},"3218":{"dur":2,"text":"labels, because we want to eat whole real\nfoods."},"3221":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean an apple does not need an ingredient\nlabel."},"3223":{"dur":6,"text":"A whole coconut does not need an ingredient\nlabel, yet, bottled coconut water in a package"},"3230":{"dur":1,"text":"needs an ingredient label, right?"},"3231":{"dur":2,"text":"So eat things without ingredient labels."},"3234":{"dur":5,"text":"Yet, on some bottles of Kombucha, like you\nsaid there\u2019s a lot of variability, you guys"},"3239":{"dur":4,"text":"look at the sugar since we\u2019re taught sugar\u2019s\nbad but on some bottles of Kombucha the sugar\u2019s"},"3243":{"dur":1,"text":"almost exactly the same."},"3244":{"dur":4,"text":"Do you think this is accurate and what are\nyour comments on that in general?"},"3248":{"dur":9,"text":"CORY: My comments in general are that there\u2019s\ngotta go, I think the FDA has a pretty impossible"},"3257":{"dur":3,"text":"task of enforcing label laws."},"3261":{"dur":5,"text":"So as a consumer one of the things we really\ntry to empower people to do is if you have"},"3266":{"dur":6,"text":"the ability to know your food manufacturer\nand they\u2019re open enough that they can receive"},"3273":{"dur":7,"text":"a phone call and answer some simple questions,\nthen it really can be this line of communication"},"3281":{"dur":4,"text":"that you deserve to have knowing what goes\ninto your product."},"3285":{"dur":6,"text":"The difficult thing, and it\u2019s with Kombucha\nis that sugar levels can vary slightly from"},"3292":{"dur":2,"text":"batch to batch."},"3294":{"dur":7,"text":"Does that mean that because there\u2019s a nutrient\nfact label on your bottle of whatever brand"},"3302":{"dur":3,"text":"of Kombucha that they\u2019re lying to you?"},"3306":{"dur":5,"text":"No, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that, but\nif you really want to know, then make a phone"},"3312":{"dur":5,"text":"call or make an email to ask some simple questions."},"3318":{"dur":6,"text":"Usually the response that you\u2019ll get from\na manufacturer will quickly let you know whether"},"3324":{"dur":3,"text":"they\u2019re going to be transparent with their\nconsumers or whether they just don\u2019t want"},"3328":{"dur":1,"text":"you to know."},"3329":{"dur":6,"text":"That\u2019s not unique to Kombucha, but it\u2019s\nreally to the whole food industry itself."},"3336":{"dur":4,"text":"JOHN: So Cory I would definitely agree with\nyou on that, and I want to encourage you guys"},"3340":{"dur":2,"text":"to trust your own senses."},"3342":{"dur":4,"text":"If you taste the Kombucha and it tastes sweet\nand there\u2019s like one gram of sugar in there,"},"3347":{"dur":1,"text":"something\u2019s probably up."},"3348":{"dur":6,"text":"I\u2019ve tasted the Kombucha here and it\u2019s\none of the most nonsweet Kombuchas that I\u2019ve"},"3354":{"dur":1,"text":"tasted."},"3355":{"dur":3,"text":"So the
