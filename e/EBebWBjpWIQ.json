problem,\nthere's a big problem,"},"69":{"dur":2,"text":"and that is that rockets are too slow."},"73":{"dur":1,"text":"In order to demonstrate that,"},"75":{"dur":3,"text":"our fastest object\nthat humans have ever created"},"78":{"dur":4,"text":"is the Voyager 1 spacecraft,\nand that moves at 15 km\/s."},"83":{"dur":3,"text":"That may seem like a fast speed,\nbut if you want to go to Mars with

predicted by Paul Dirac -\nup there in the top-right corner."},"179":{"dur":3,"text":"He was actually struggling\nwith two relatively new concepts,"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"one being special relativity,"},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"which describes life\nat really high speeds"},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"and the speed of light,"},"190":{"dur":1,"text":"and quantum mechanics,"},"191":{"dur":5,"text":"which describes the Earth\nor the world of the very small,"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"atoms and molecules."},"198":{"dur":3,"text":"So he was solving this relativistic\nquantum mechanics equation,"},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"and he came out with two answers:"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"a positive energy and a negative energy\nfor these particles."},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"How many times\nyou've been doing your homework,"},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"and you come up with a negative answer,"},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"and you say: \"Chuck that,"},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"just look at the positive\nenergy solutions,"},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"because that\u2019s what makes sense.\""},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"But Paul Dirac was a genius, and he saw\nthese negative energy solutions,"},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"and he said: \"Wait a minute, maybe there\u2019s\na whole new set of particles out there"},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"that we haven\u2019t even seen.\""},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"Some people thought\nhe was crazy of course."},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"But it was only three years later"},"231":{"dur":4,"text":"that Carl Anderson at CalTech\nsaw this in his cloud chamber."},"235":{"dur":3,"text":"He saw the track\nof a particle going, curving,"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"and it had the same energy\nand mass as an electron,"},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"but it was curving the wrong way."},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"It should have been curving to the right\nif it was an electron."},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is the first experimental\nevidence of antimatter"},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"or an anti-electron,\nwhich we like to call positrons."},"255":{"dur":4,"text":"So antimatter I like to describe\nas mirror matter."},"259":{"dur":4,"text":"If there was an anti-you in a mirror,\nit would look exactly like you,"},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"except that everything would be flipped."},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"The same is true at the subatomic level."},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"Anti-electrons have\nthe same mass as electrons,"},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"just positive charge rather\nthan negative charge."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"That\u2019s why we call them positrons."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"An interesting characteristic\nof antimatter is annihilation."},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"It\u2019s quite unique in that"},"286":{"dur":3,"text":"if you have an antimatter particle\nand a matter particle,"},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"and they get close enough together,"},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"they\u2019ll both disappear\nand turn into pure energy."},"295":{"dur":4,"text":"Now this is the Universe\u2019s most efficient\nmeans of turning mass into energy,"},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"and it\u2019s quite powerful,"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"and that\u2019s what got me interested\nin positron physics years ago."},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"What does that mean\nin terms of energy density"},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"if you had a clump of antimatter?"},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"Antimatter has about\n90 megajoules per microgram."},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"I know that doesn\u2019t mean much to you,"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"but to put that in more familiar terms,"},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"if you had a gram of antimatter,\nor an M&M-size piece of antimatter,"},"324":{"dur":4,"text":"then you have the same amount of energy\nas about 80 kilotons of nuclear weapon,"},"328":{"dur":4,"text":"or alternatively about 10 million liters\nof liquid natural gas -"},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"about a full tanker load."},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"So not only does antimatter\nhave incredible promises"},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"as a fuel for spacecraft,"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"but this has some pretty\nsignificant applications"},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"in the future of energy research,\nenergy production,"},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"especially in inertial confinement systems\nand pulsed energy delivery."},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"But I\u2019m more interested\nin the propulsion side of things,"},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"and so is my company."},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"The original concept\nof antimatter propulsion,"},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"it was actually developed\nin the fifties by Eugen S\u00e4nger."},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"And what he did was, he said:"},"367":{"dur":4,"text":"\"What if you had a clump of antimatter,\nyou took it out in your spacecraft,"},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"and then you annihilated it\nin the rocket engine nozzle,"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"and you\u2019re able\nto direct that energy flow,"},"376":{"dur":5,"text":"you\u2019re able to direct those gamma rays\nso that you have thrust in one direction.\""},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"This was cutting edge at that time,"},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"but there were really three problems,"},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"one of which was production."},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"You can\u2019t create enough antimatter\nto do this, unfortunately."},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"The other is that you\ncan\u2019t trap the antimatter."},"395":{"dur":4,"text":"Of course, that property of annihilation\nwhich is good for the energy density"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"is really bad for being able to trap it."},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"You need very high strength\nmagnetic fields,"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"and it just wasn\u2019t feasible,\nstill isn't feasible,"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"to trap large amounts of antimatter."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"The third problem\nwith the original concept"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"was directing that energy."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"Gamma rays are much higher\nenergy than x-rays."},"418":{"dur":4,"text":"Of course, if you go through the TSA\nin the airport, they x-ray your bag."},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"X-rays tend to go through everything,\nand gamma rays even more so."},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"Reflecting gamma rays is something\nthat we can\u2019t do right now."},"431":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I started thinking about\nthese problems in 2011,"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"finishing up my PhD in positron physics."},"437":{"dur":5,"text":"I realized that the real issue,\nthe limiting factor,"},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"was when you went from hot positrons\nto cold positrons."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"Now state of the art in 2011:"},"449":{"dur":5,"text":"You had your source of hot positrons,\nand what you did, and still do, is"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"to run it through\na solid piece of material."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"What this does is, it's very thin,"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"so that most of the positrons\njust travel right through,"},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"a very small number will actually stop\ninside the material."},"466":{"dur":4,"text":"Of course, a large number\nof those will hit an electron"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"because our matter\nis made of a lot of electrons,"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"and they will lose it."},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"A very small number,\nabout one out of 1,000,"},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"will make it to the surface\nand be emitted as a cold positron."},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you have to be able\nto create cold positrons"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"in order to work with them."},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"They come out at a million times hotter\nthan the surface of the Sun,"},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"so you have to be able to cool them down."},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"This process was very inefficient,"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"so we started thinking\nof new ways to do this."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"My lab partner and I\ndiscussed this for about a year."},"501":{"dur":4,"text":"We came out with a napkin sketch\nof an array moderator."},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"Soon after that we made it\nan actual patent,"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"and then asked\nfor some money from a grant,"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"and we were funded by the Steel Foundation"},"513":{"dur":4,"text":"to do the initial proof of concept\non that moderator."},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"This moderator now forms the heart\nof all our propulsion concepts,"},"522":{"dur":4,"text":"and that little piece up there\nis actually very tiny, it is about 3x3 mm,"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"but it\u2019s the source for all\nof our antimatter concepts."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"When you are developing a concept,\nyou also have to develop a team."},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"So back in 2012, I asked\nsome friends of mine"},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"whom I was working on another\nrocket project there in the desert with."},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"I said, \"Well, let\u2019s give up\nthis chemical stuff."},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"Why don't you guys come help me\nbuild an antimatter rocket?\""},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"Who's going to say no to that?"},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we rented a little office,"},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"brought in a bunch\nof nuclear science equipment."},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"We quickly realized that the landlord\ndidn\u2019t appreciate that,"},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"so we got kicked out of there."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"In the next year, we moved into\na little more appropriate facility,"},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"and then, last year, finally,\nwe made our way down"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"to a nuclear fallout shelter\nwith a clean room."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"This new facility will allow us\nto develop some of our concepts"},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"and integrate them into a CubeSat,\nwhich is a very small satellite,"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"very easy to launch, very easy\nto demonstrate new concepts on."},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"How do we get around those three issues:"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"production, trapping and directing energy?"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"The first two, production and trapping,"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"are got around by having\na very efficient moderator."},"596":{"dur":5,"text":"We use a radioisotope source of positrons\nwhich continuously emits positrons."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"We run it through\nour little tiny moderator,"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"and we can create\na very high-intensity positron beam."},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"The third challenge is directing\nthe annihilation energy."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"In order to do that,"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"we transfer the kinetic energy\nof the gamma ray into a charged particle"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"via fusion reactions."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"And now we have a charged particle\nthat's high energy"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"rather than a gamma ray."},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's important"},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"because charged particles\nlike to follow magnetic field lines,"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"as you know from the Aurora Borealis."},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we use magnets like\nthe one in the bottom right there,"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"to actually direct the energy\nand produce thrust."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"In about two years, we were hoping\nto put a demonstrator CubeSat -"},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"that little tiny spacecraft -"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"into orbit."},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"Why is this useful?"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"What is it that a really small\nspacecraft can do for you?"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, it turns out,"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"that about 4 billion people\non the surface of the Earth"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"don\u2019t have access to Internet."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's a lot of companies"},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"that want to launch\nconstellations of small satellites"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"into low Earth orbit."},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"They will create a global network\nof broadband Internets,"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"so that anyone can\naccess that information."},"669":{"dur":4,"text":"I think that would be\nan incredible opening door for the Earth."},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"A little bit further down the road,"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"what we want to do,\nand what government agencies want to do,"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"and some private companies like SpaceX,"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"they want to send things out to Mars,"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"and our technology\nwould allow them to do that"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"and cut the transit time significantly."},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, kind of a far-out application\nfor this, is asteroid mining."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"I know you've probably never heard\nof asteroid mining,"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"but it turns out that very small asteroids\nin our asteroid belt, metal rich,"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"is worth a lot of money."},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"With chemical rockets,\nyou can't just go out there and get it,"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"you need something\nlike an antimatter system."},"710":{"dur":4,"text":"In terms of extending this technology\ninto human space travel,"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"that will require, of course,\na lot of work."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"It turns out that our squishy bodies"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"can only really handle\nabout 1g acceleration,"},"724":{"dur":6,"text":"and even so 1g, 9.8 m\/s\/s,\nis actually pretty high acceleration."},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"NASA took ten years\nto get to the Pluto;"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"if we go at 1g, we can get there\nin about 3.5 weeks,"},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"which isn\u2019t that bad."},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"If we want to go to Alpha Centauri,\nthe story gets a little different,"},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"and we start bringing in\nconcepts of special relativity."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"If we want to go out there\nat 4.3 light years,"},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"at 1g it would take about five years\ngoing at about 85% the speed of light."},"755":{"dur":4,"text":"Once we start getting toward a significant\nfraction of the speed of light,"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"we start getting time dilation,"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"which is an interesting phenomenon,"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"but really it\u2019s the thing that allows us\nto travel out into the Universe."},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"While five years\nhas elapsed on the spacecraft,"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"nine years has elapsed on the Earth."},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"It's getting weird, but still feasible."},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"If we extend this out to Kepler-452b,"},"782":{"dur":5,"text":"Kepler-452b is an interesting place\nbecause a lot of people call it Earth 2.0."},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"It\u2019s a little bit bigger than Earth,"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"it\u2019s in the habitable zone of its Sun."},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of people\nwant to go there and see -"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe there's life."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"I think there is a good chance\nthat there might be,"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"although it is 1500 light years away."},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"With our 1g spacecraft\nwe could get there in 12 years"},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"on the spacecraft."},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"Unfortunately, 1,500 years\nwill have passed on Earth."},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"So things are getting a little weirder."},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"If we look at the ultimate\napplication of this,"},"817":{"dur":5,"text":"exploring to the edges of our Universe,\n13.5 billion light years away,"},"823":{"dur":4,"text":"at 1g we could make it there\nin a human lifetime, 30 years."},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, we are going incredibly fast,\ntowards the speed of light,"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"but the only problem is,"},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"that 13.5 billion years would have passed\nhere on the Earth."},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"What I\u2019m trying to say is that,"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"with the transformative\ntechnology like this,"},"840":{"dur":3,"text":"we have to think seriously\nabout the consequences,"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"and new questions that arise."},"846":{"dur":1,"text":"The first of which is:"},"847":{"dur":5,"text":"If we want to really explore beyond\nour Solar System into our galaxy,"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"we are going to have to do it ourselves:"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"if we do send a probe or a robot,"},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"we will never hear back\nfrom it, essentially."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the second issue is:"},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"If we do want to go out beyond our galaxy,"},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"we're going to essentially\nbe saying goodbye to this."},"872":{"dur":4,"text":"And you know human beings used\nto be a nomadic species,"},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"and so one of the questions\nI am asking you is:"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"Do we want to become nomads again?"},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you very much."},"884":{"dur":4,"text":"(Applause)"}}
