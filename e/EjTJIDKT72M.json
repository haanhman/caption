got a lot to cover."},"12":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to teach you\na lot of stuff today."},"14":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's get started."},"16":{"dur":0,"text":"So Material Design."},"17":{"dur":1,"text":"Hopefully everyone."},"19":{"dur":2,"text":"So introduced at Google\nI\/O a couple of years ago."},"22":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"23":{"dur":1,"text":"An amazing design\nsystem for helping you"},"25":{"dur":3,"text":"build incredible,\nconsistent, usable apps."},"29":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the things that\nI personally really,"},"31":{"dur":2,"text":"really like about Material\nDesign, and that I think"},"33":{"dur":4,"text":"sets it apart from other design\nsystems out there, is this."},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"It has these principles."},"40":{"dur":2,"text":"It has these kind\nof-- it strives"},"42":{"dur":2,"text":"to go beyond what a lot of\ndesign systems do out there."},"45":{"dur":1,"text":"It tries to answer\nthe question, what"},"47":{"dur":4,"text":"is the material that your\nUI is actually built out of?"},"51":{"dur":3,"text":"It provides these guidelines\nwhich describe the world"},"54":{"dur":1,"text":"that your UI lives in."},"55":{"dur":2,"text":"It's kind of like how we\nhave the laws of physics"},"58":{"dur":2,"text":"in the real world, which,\nonce you understand"},"60":{"dur":3,"text":"the laws of physics, they can\nbe applied to other situations."},"63":{"dur":1,"text":"It's the same in the UI world."},"65":{"dur":2,"text":"If you have this level of\nconsistency underneath things,"},"68":{"dur":2,"text":"it means that patterns\nlearned in one place"},"70":{"dur":2,"text":"can be applied elsewhere."},"73":{"dur":1,"text":"While Material\nDesign is very wide"},"74":{"dur":2,"text":"ranging-- it kind of gives you\na lot of patterns and components"},"77":{"dur":2,"text":"to work with to build your\nUIs with-- no design system"},"80":{"dur":1,"text":"can be comprehensive."},"82":{"dur":3,"text":"It can't think of every single\nsituation, every use case"},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"that your app is\ntrying to solve for."},"88":{"dur":2,"text":"But by having some\nunderlying principles,"},"90":{"dur":2,"text":"some kind of\nconsistency underneath,"},"92":{"dur":1,"text":"if you try and\nstick to these, when"},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"you solve your\nparticular use case"},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"it will feel consistent with the\nother components and patterns"},"99":{"dur":4,"text":"out there, making for a better\nexperience for everyone."},"104":{"dur":1,"text":"But the problem\nwith the principles"},"105":{"dur":2,"text":"is that it's somewhat\nabstract, I feel."},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes it can be hard to\nunderstand exactly how they"},"110":{"dur":1,"text":"apply to your application."},"112":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'd like today to\ntalk to you about this."},"114":{"dur":1,"text":"This is an application\nI built called"},"116":{"dur":5,"text":"Plaid, which attempts to\nembody these principles."},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"So by discussing some\nconcrete examples"},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"of applying the\nprinciples, I hope"},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"to help you to develop a better\nunderstanding of what they are,"},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"to understand how they\ncan actually help improve"},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"your application,\nas well as teach you"},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"how to build them on Android."},"137":{"dur":1,"text":"So a couple things."},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"This app is completely\nopen source."},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can grab the\nsource code on GitHub"},"143":{"dur":2,"text":"or you can join-- it's\nin beta at the moment"},"145":{"dur":3,"text":"on the Play Store, which you\ncan join at that top link."},"149":{"dur":3,"text":"This app-- also, I want to call\nout-- uses a minimum SDK of 21."},"152":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a Lollipop and beyond app."},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"I did that mostly\nto unburden myself"},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"from backwards compatibility,\nto see what we could build."},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"But there are efforts going\non-- actually, mostly driven"},"161":{"dur":1,"text":"by amazing third\nparty contributions."},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's a back port branch,\nwhich actually brings it"},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"all the way back to API 17."},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's crack on with\nthe application."},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's go through the Material\nprinciples one at a time,"},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"and let's see how\nwe can actually"},"176":{"dur":3,"text":"make the application better,\nand how to build those things."},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"So the first Material\nprinciple is the idea"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"of Material tangible surfaces."},"184":{"dur":1,"text":"This is the idea that\neverything in your UI"},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"lives within a surface."},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"And these surfaces can have\ndifferent sizes, shapes,"},"191":{"dur":1,"text":"and elevations, and so on."},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"Now surfaces really,\nreally help you to-- they"},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"tap into a part of your brain\nwhich recognizes that one"},"197":{"dur":1,"text":"thing is separate to another."},"198":{"dur":1,"text":"We call that tangible objects."},"200":{"dur":1,"text":"That means you can see\nthat a button is going"},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"to be a tap target,\nor that one surface is"},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"going to move past each other."},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"It's also really helpful\nfor providing hierarchy"},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"We're really good at\nknowing that things"},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"which are closer to you are\nlarger or more important."},"213":{"dur":1,"text":"We just know this\nfrom the real world."},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can use that in your UI\nto direct attention to the most"},"217":{"dur":1,"text":"important information."},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's an example."},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"So in the application,\nI showed some images"},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"from the awesome show and\ntell site called Dribbble."},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"And the image is the primary\nfocus of this application--"},"228":{"dur":0,"text":"of this screen."},"229":{"dur":0,"text":"Sorry."},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"So it gives this big old\nprominent area at the top."},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"But once you've seen\nthe image, you perhaps"},"236":{"dur":0,"text":"might want to take\nsome other action."},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's comments or\ndescriptions and so on, then."},"239":{"dur":1,"text":"I kind of want to get\nit out of the way,"},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"but still have it accessible."},"243":{"dur":1,"text":"So here's how I do it in Plaid."},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"Hopefully you can see it\ncollapses with some parallax"},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"to keep it centered."},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"Then at a certain\npoint, the image"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"pins-- I like to think of it--\nand lifts up to let the content"},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"pass below it."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"If we were to take a 3D view\nof what's going on here,"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"it's kind of like-- it\ncollapses to a certain point,"},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"and then the surface\nitself lifts up"},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"into a separate surface."},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's another\nsurface going on here."},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"The floating action button."},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"We're saying that this is\nthe most prominent thing."},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that liking\na shot is one"},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"of the most prominent\nactions I want to call out."},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"So having that on\nits own surface"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"which moves with certain\nphysics and then snaps"},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"when it reaches the\nbottom of that lie there,"},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"again, helps to\ndirect attention."},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"So how would we build this?"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, I decided to use\na stateless animator,"},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"because you could imagine\ndoing this yourself."},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"Listen to the scroll\nposition of the list,"},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"and when you reach a certain\nminimum height for the image,"},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"then just elevating it."},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"But that would put\non you the burden"},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"of having to run an\nanimation, work out"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"if the user has quickly scrolled\nand quickly scrolled back,"},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"then you have to cancel\nit and reverse it."},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"Instead, using a stateless\nanimator helps you to-- it"},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"does it automatically for you."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"So all I do is I basically\nset this state of pinned"},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"to true or false, depending\non how far these are scrolled."},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"And then just run an\nanimation over the translation"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"z property, and it\nwill produce this"},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"lifting up and pinning effect."},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"I use surfaces again\nin the same screen"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"when looking at\ncomments on a shot."},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"So for each of the\ncomments in the list below,"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"there are certain actions\nyou can take, replying,"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"liking the comment,\nand so on and so forth."},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"Rather than an\nalternative presentation--"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"it might have been to have these\ncomments visible or overflow"},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"items and so on and so forth."},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"But that would have led to a\nmore cluttered look and feel."},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"I wanted this thing\na bit cleaner."},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"So using the idea of surfaces\nhere, I think helped."},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"Because, as you\ntap on a surface,"},"352":{"dur":1,"text":"we have this idea that\nit raises up and gets"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"an elevation and a little\ndrop shadow underneath."},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"And the comment actions\nreveal themselves."},"359":{"dur":1,"text":"So again, I feel\nsurfaces help to make"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"it a cleaner presentation."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"And building it was pretty easy."},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"There's three steps to it,\nwhich I'll walk you through."},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"So firstly, it's a comment--\nit's an adapter at the base,"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"so in the list use\nadapter, we work out"},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"whether we can hold\nonto the position"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"of the current expanded item."},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"And based on if it's\nthe expanded one,"},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"we just set the visibility of\nthose little actions there."},"385":{"dur":4,"text":"Then in the onClick handler,\nwe store the position"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"of the one you are\ntrying to expand."},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we use one\nof my favorite APIs"},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"in Android, which\nis TransitionManage"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"r.beginDelayedTransition."},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"This is deceptively\nsimple, because it's"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"doing lots and lots\nof work for us here."},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"So by saying\nbeginDelayedTransition"},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"and, crucially, we parse\nthe whole of the list view,"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"rather than the individual\nview you clicked on."},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"That will then watch\nfor any changes"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"to any views underneath\nthe list view."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's going to handle\ncollapsing one item"},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"and expanding another\nitem smoothly for us."},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"We then call\nnotifyDataSetChanged,"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"which will then rebind\nboth of the items"},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"and set the right visibilities."},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"You notice we also set\nthe activated state"},"429":{"dur":4,"text":"based on whether the currently\nselected item's expanded."},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"We then just pretty simply\nis use a stateless drawable"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"for the background."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"And two of my\nfavorite attributes,"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"which most people\ndon't tend to set,"},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"is you can set this enter\nand exit fade duration."},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"So this will\nautomatically handle"},"445":{"dur":0,"text":"the color change for you."},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"So when you select\nan item, it fades in"},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"nicely from the background\ncolor to a pure white,"},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"to show it in the\nselected state,"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"or fade out the one that\nis getting deselected."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"All, again,\nautomatically for you."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"And similarly, we use\na stateless animator"},"459":{"dur":5,"text":"again to do some translations\nz to lift up and out."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"So hopefully you can see just--\nsome pretty simple stuff."},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"There's no major custom\nwork going on here."},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"It achieves this quite\nsmooth, nice effect,"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"and makes for a cleaner layout."},"473":{"dur":4,"text":"So I think surfaces really\nhelped with this here."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"Next up is this section of\nthe Material spec, which I"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"really, really like,\nwhich is talking"},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"about navigational transitions."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"And it talks specifically\nabout navigating from a parent"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"to a child screen."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"And it shows this video here."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"I love this idea that\nwhen you click on an item,"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"it lifts up out of\nthe parent screen"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"and expands out to\nfill the screen."},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll come back to the motion\npart of doing that a little bit"},"502":{"dur":0,"text":"later on."},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"But part of the thing\nI like about this"},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"is the idea-- this\npermanence idea"},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"that the previous\ncontent is still there,"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"and that the new\nscreen is lifted up"},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's sitting on top of it."},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"I use this idea in Plaid."},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"So for example, here is a grid\nof images we're looking at."},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"When you tap on one\nitem, it lifts up."},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"But crucially, what\nI've done here,"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"is that when you\noverscroll down,"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"I start to translate and\nscale the content downwards."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"But peek, and you can\nsee the screen behind."},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"Again this is\nreinforcing this idea"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"that this new screen of\ncontent is sitting on top."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"I feel like it gives it\nmore of a sense of place."},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"You understand where\nyou've come from."},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"It's hard to get\nlost, because it's"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"so continuous an experience."},"549":{"dur":6,"text":"So to build this-- notice also\nthat when you try and collapse"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"it, it's a single gesture."},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"So in the content here,\nI'm scrolling down,"},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"keep on scrolling\nfrom the same gesture,"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"leads to this\nbackwards behavior."},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not like you have\nto scroll and then"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"scroll again or\nanything like that."},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"It's one single experience."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's all built\non the awesomeness"},"567":{"dur":0,"text":"of nested scrolling."},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you haven't checked\nout nested scrolling,"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"it's really, really cool."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"So here's a-- it's a\ncustom view I wrote to do"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"this, which extends\nframe layout."},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"And what nested\nscrolling lets you do"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"is listen to scroll events that\nthe child of that is doing."},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"So inside the\nframe layout, there"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"is a ListView here which\nis sending scroll events."},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"And basically, you just\noverwrite a few APIs."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"So the first one is\nonStartMessageScroll."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"This is basically\nasking, are you"},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"interested in listening\nto more nested scrolls."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"Here I'm saying, anything\nthat's scrolling vertically I'm"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"interested in, please\nsend me more events."},"600":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you returned true from\nthat one, every time the user"},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"scrolls in the list, I'll get\nthis onNestedScroll event."},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can do stuff\nwith working out"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"how much the ListView\nscrolls by itself,"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"but the one I'm actually really,\nreally interested in here"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"is that last parameter,\nwhich is dyUnconsumed."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"So that basically tells me\nif the List has scrolled"},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"to the end of its scroll\nrange, but the user carried"},"622":{"dur":4,"text":"on trying to scroll, there were\nsome unconsumed scroll events."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"So I want to take those,\nand I'll then just"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"use set translation\ny and set scale"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"to actually translate and\nscale down all the content,"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"moving it away."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"And then finally, when the\nuser lets go, I can work out,"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"did they scroll past\na certain threshold?"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"If so, I'm going to\nfinish the activity"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"and run an animation\nto collapse it."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"Otherwise, I'll settle it back\ninto its natural position."},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"The final part of\nthe puzzle here"},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"is that the activity was sat on\ntop of the previous activity."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can see through\nto it the one behind."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"The way that you do that\nis you set this flag"},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"windowIsTranslucent."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"And what that means is that\nyou're telling the system,"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"don't finish the\nprevious activity."},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"So it'll go into onPause,\nbut it won't actually"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"go into unDestroyed,\nbecause you're"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"saying that when the content\non top is translucent,"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"it's going to be able\nto see through to you."},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"It's kind of like, if you showed\na dialog on top of your app,"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"rather than showing a new\nactivity, it won't finish you."},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you set a\nsemi-transparent window"},"683":{"dur":0,"text":"background."},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"For those of you who\ndon't read hex colors,"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"that's like a semi-opaque gray."},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"That's how you build it."},"690":{"dur":0,"text":"So that was surfaces."},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"Again, I think made it\nmore understandable."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"So another example of\nsurfaces in the application"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"is-- this is a Dribbble\nprofile screen."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"So here I use surfaces\nwith great prejudice"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"to basically show\ncontent hierarchy."},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"So here, when you\nscroll the content,"},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"I actually made the decision to\nleave the profile information"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"statically, and have the images\nscroll completely on top of it,"},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"completely in front\nof the content."},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"This is me being\nopinionated and saying,"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"I think images are the most\nimportant part of this,"},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"and I want to direct\nattention to those."},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's how you do it."},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"So how would you build this?"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"You can consider--\na frame layout"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"lets you overlap content."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"So you might put the\nprofile information"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"in one layer, then the\nRecyclerView of images on top."},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's all well and good."},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"But what about the clicks?"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"If the RecyclerView's\non top, how"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"do you let clicks pass through?"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"So I kind of cheat\na little bit here."},"743":{"dur":4,"text":"So I set an onTouchListener\nonto the RecyclerView itself."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I work out where\nthe top of the first item"},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"is, which I've set\ndown with some padding."},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"So then, if the\ntouch point where"},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"you're touching on\nthe RecyclerView"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"is above the first\nitem, I directly"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"call and dispatchTouchEvent\nonto the content behind."},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the description\nfield behind."},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"So that forwards\non the touch event."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"So again like letting the touch\npass through the RecyclerView"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"onto the content behind."},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"So it lets you do this\nkind of layering trick."},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"And my last example\nof surfaces is--"},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"I love the idea that\nsurfaces, while they're"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"inspired by paper and\nthings in the real world,"},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"they're not limited to them."},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"I love the idea that we can\ntransform from one shape"},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"or object to another."},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"So here for example,\nI've got a couple"},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"of actions which use the\nfloating action button pattern."},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"And when you touch\nit, sometimes you"},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"have more actions to be taken."},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you're trying\nto like a shot,"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"and you haven't logged\nin, I want you to log in."},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"Or if you're trying to upload\na new shot and a poster design"},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"and use, you have to\ngive details of it."},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"Rather than-- you could imagine\na different presentation, where"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"you just show a new\nscreen or just show"},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"a dialogue on top of it, I\nfeel that by transforming"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"the surface itself,\nit's clearer that you're"},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"trying to act on this thing."},"817":{"dur":1,"text":"And it requires a second step."},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"I think the transformation\naspect of it"},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"helps you to have a\ncontinuous experience."},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"I haven't got time\nto show you how"},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"I've built this\nparticular-- shared element"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"transition is what it is."},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"But if you come to\nmy talk tomorrow,"},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"I actually go through it."},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's a window\ninto transitions."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"That was surfaces."},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"Second

talks about using classical\nthings like color, typography,"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"space, and imagery\nto really provide"},"851":{"dur":4,"text":"a nice, clear, and\nbeautiful presentation."},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"So in earlier builds of\nPlaid, I tried to use color,"},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"like color primary and\ndistinct blocks of color,"},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"but I found that displaying\na lot of imagery,"},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"as well as lots of bold\ncolors somewhat clashed."},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"So in the end, I ended up\nbacking out a lot of color."},"870":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, if you look\nat the screen here,"},"871":{"dur":1,"text":"the only thing I'm\ncontributing is the kind"},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"of floating action

instead use some\ndynamic coloring in order"},"890":{"dur":3,"text":"to make the app still\nfeel alive and thoughtful."},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"So here for example, as\nyou're clicking on an item,"},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"you can see the touch response--\nthe touche ripple you get"},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"is determined by the\nitem you're clicking on."},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"So the gray

you do that is from\nthe awesome, awesome Palette"},"910":{"dur":1,"text":"library."},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"So Palette runs over an image\nand picks out the palette"},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"of colors inside the image."},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"And one thing I want to call out\nis it offers this Filters API."},"919":{"dur":2,"text":"So Palette by default\nit's built for

landscapes."},"934":{"dur":1,"text":"So you have this API to\nclear the filters, which"},"936":{"dur":1,"text":"will give you a\nwider range of colors"},"938":{"dur":1,"text":"that it will actually\npick out an image."},"940":{"dur":1,"text":"Worth knowing about."},"941":{"dur":2,"text":"Once you have a Palette, I\nthen have this little method"},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"to create a

item."},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"So what I do is I walk through\nthe swatches one at a time."},"961":{"dur":1,"text":"You have to go\nthrough them each,"},"963":{"dur":2,"text":"because you're not\nguaranteed that there's"},"966":{"dur":1,"text":"going to be a named swatch."},"967":{"dur":2,"text":"So for example, if I were to\ngive a black and white image,"},"970":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not

out what color\nto use, and then"},"978":{"dur":1,"text":"create a new ripple drawable."},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"And then set that as the\nforeground onto the image"},"981":{"dur":1,"text":"you

anything\non top of it."},"1016":{"dur":3,"text":"So instead, I used\nthis color picking."},"1019":{"dur":2,"text":"But what about a\nsituation like this?"},"1021":{"dur":4,"text":"So here's an image

to consider."},"1068":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's going to be\nmuch more efficient."},"1071":{"dur":1,"text":"And I also want to\ncall out the fact"},"1072":{"dur":2,"text":"that Palette lets you set\nthe maximum number of colors"},"1075":{"dur":2,"text":"that you look at-- that\nyou consider in an image."},"1077":{"dur":1,"text":"Basically what Palette's\ndoing is walking

colors"},"1083":{"dur":1,"text":"which are in the image."},"1085":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can control that."},"1086":{"dur":2,"text":"So here I found setting this\nallowed me to pick the

obvious."},"1723":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?"},"1724":{"dur":2,"text":"You say the image is here,\nand it's going to here,"},"1726":{"dur":4,"text":"and this changeBounds\ntransition will handle the

background."},"1838":{"dur":2,"text":"So it, by default,\nwon't cast a shadow."},"1841":{"dur":2,"text":"So by running a custom\ntransition, which will actually"},"1843":{"dur":1,"text":"set some elevation\non the background"},"1845":{"dur":3,"text":"while it's transitioning, we\ncan actually cast this shadow."},"1849":{"dur":2,"text":"This might seem-- maybe I was\nbeing a bit too

better."},"1857":{"dur":1,"text":"It feels right."},"1858":{"dur":1,"text":"Trust me."},"1859":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the easiest transition\nI've ever written in my life."},"1862":{"dur":2,"text":"You basically pass it\nin at a value elevation"},"1865":{"dur":2,"text":"to use during the change."},"1867":{"dur":3,"text":"And you just animate the\ntranslations z property"},"1871":{"dur":3,"text":"to start off from the elevated\nvalue and settle down back to 0"},"1874":{"dur":1,"text":"over the course\nof the transition."},"1876":{"dur":2,"text":"And I actually run this for\na slightly longer duration"},"1878":{"dur":4,"text":"than the-- let me see if I can\nget this to show-- I run it"},"1883":{"dur":2,"text":"for a slightly longer duration\nthan the ChangeBounds, as well."},"1886":{"dur":2,"text":"So you see it actually\nchanges into position"},"1888":{"dur":1,"text":"and then settles down."},"1889":{"dur":1,"text":"So it gives this\neffect of lifting up"},"1891":{"dur":3,"text":"and growing and collapsing\nand setting back in."},"1898":{"dur":3,"text":"Last piece is that the\nimage is moving upwards,"},"1901":{"dur":2,"text":"so I wanted the content\nto enter upwards with it,"},"1903":{"dur":2,"text":"to make it this kind\nof cohesive experience."},"1906":{"dur":2,"text":"So rather than the image coming\nin and the content just popping"},"1908":{"dur":1,"text":"in, I wanted it to like\nfeel like it was all"},"1910":{"dur":2,"text":"moving in the same path."},"1912":{"dur":2,"text":"So mostly it's handled with\nthis window

screen."},"1919":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's just using\nthis slide to slide"},"1921":{"dur":2,"text":"the content in from the bottom."},"1924":{"dur":1,"text":"But as we saw\nbefore, this screen"},"1926":{"dur":3,"text":"is some static content and\nthen a RecyclerView of items."},"1929":{"dur":1,"text":"So that led to\nthis weird feeling"},"1931":{"dur":1,"text":"where some of the\ncontent would slide in,"},"1932":{"dur":2,"text":"and then the RecyclerView\ndoes a network request,"},"1935":{"dur":2,"text":"gets the images, and\nthen they just load in,"},"1937":{"dur":1,"text":"which wasn't ideal."},"1939":{"dur":4,"text":"So instead, I wrote a\ncustom item animator"},"1943":{"dur":3,"text":"for the RecyclerView, which\nwill then animate the items"},"1946":{"dur":3,"text":"in upwards, as they load."},"1949":{"dur":2,"text":"So just extend the default\nitem animator that RecyclerView"},"1952":{"dur":1,"text":"gives you for free."},"1953":{"dur":2,"text":"And I overrode the animateAdd\nmethod, where you basically"},"1956":{"dur":2,"text":"You basically translate\nit downwards and set it"},"1959":{"dur":1,"text":"to invisible."},"1961":{"dur":2,"text":"And then when you run\nthe pending animations,"},"1963":{"dur":2,"text":"you animate those properties\nback to their natural place."},"1965":{"dur":5,"text":"You fade it in, and animate\nit upwards, and do some stuff."},"1970":{"dur":2,"text":"So that was one transition."},"1973":{"dur":3,"text":"Another transition I want to\ntalk about is the search view."},"1977":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is what searching\nlooks like in Plaid."},"1982":{"dur":2,"text":"And again, there's quite\na lot going on here."},"1985":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's slow it down and\nstep through it a little bit."},"1988":{"dur":3,"text":"Firstly, when you\ncome into the screen,"},"1991":{"dur":2,"text":"I expand out this\nscrim, and then"},"1993":{"dur":2,"text":"also do an animation\non the icon itself"},"1996":{"dur":3,"text":"to change it from the\nsearch icon to the back."},"1999":{"dur":3,"text":"And then fade in\nthe search field."},"2003":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, once you've done a\nquery, we load in the results."},"2006":{"dur":3,"text":"So the goal here is really\nabout directing attention."},"2010":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you touch\non the search thing,"},"2013":{"dur":2,"text":"I want it to feel like\nthis transient experience."},"2015":{"dur":1,"text":"So that it's just\ncoming in transiently"},"2016":{"dur":1,"text":"over the top of\nthe content, which"},"2018":{"dur":2,"text":"is why I do that scrim\ncoming in slowly and gently."},"2021":{"dur":1,"text":"But the next thing\nI want you to do"},"2022":{"dur":2,"text":"is to enter a search query\nin the search field, which"},"2024":{"dur":1,"text":"is over on the left."},"2025":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's why I feel the\nanimation over from one side"},"2028":{"dur":3,"text":"directs your attention to\nwhat you have to do next."},"2032":{"dur":2,"text":"Similarly, once you've\nentered your query,"},"2034":{"dur":2,"text":"you can see that the\ncontainer expands"},"2037":{"dur":2,"text":"downwards to make room for\nthe search results to come in."},"2039":{"dur":1,"text":"Again, that's priming\nyou for the attention."},"2041":{"dur":1,"text":"For you to say,\nOK, I've done that."},"2043":{"dur":1,"text":"Now I'm looking\ndown here to where"},"2044":{"dur":1,"text":"the content's going to be."},"2045":{"dur":2,"text":"It's all about directing\nyour attention."},"2048":{"dur":2,"text":"Like the previous screen, this\nis obviously doing network."},"2051":{"dur":2,"text":"It's going out, hitting an\nAPI with a search query,"},"2053":{"dur":2,"text":"and getting content back,\nand loading the images."},"2055":{"dur":2,"text":"I feel like this\nanimation also helps hide"},"2058":{"dur":1,"text":"some of that work going on."},"2059":{"dur":1,"text":"It's distracting."},"2061":{"dur":1,"text":"The animation\nstretching downwards"},"2062":{"dur":2,"text":"is buying time while I'm\ndoing this networking"},"2065":{"dur":2,"text":"and coming back to make it\nfeel more responsive than it,"},"2068":{"dur":2,"text":"perhaps, technically is."},"2070":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I'm not going to go\nthrough every single step"},"2072":{"dur":2,"text":"of this animation, because it's\nusing a lot of the principles"},"2074":{"dur":2,"text":"we've talked about before,\nusing animators and so on."},"2077":{"dur":2,"text":"One thing I do want to focus\non is on the icon animation."},"2079":{"dur":2,"text":"I feel like doing\nthe icon animation,"},"2081":{"dur":3,"text":"as well as directing attention,\nit also is a playful element."},"2085":{"dur":4,"text":"It embodies some character\nto the application, I feel."},"2089":{"dur":1,"text":"I also have to\ncall up some credit"},"2091":{"dur":3,"text":"to-- I was inspired to build\nthis animation from something"},"2094":{"dur":0,"text":"I saw on Dribbble."},"2095":{"dur":1,"text":"So it feels quite apt."},"2097":{"dur":1,"text":"A dribbled line\nreferencing Dribbble."},"2098":{"dur":1,"text":"Anway--"},"2100":{"dur":2,"text":"How would we build an\nanimation like this?"},"2103":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is a animated\nvector drawable."},"2105":{"dur":2,"text":"So hopefully if anyone here\nhas worked with vectors,"},"2108":{"dur":3,"text":"you know that you can basically\ndraw lines and fill paths"},"2112":{"dur":1,"text":"and so on and so forth."},"2113":{"dur":2,"text":"But not many people, I think,\nknow about the trim properties"},"2115":{"dur":1,"text":"you can set on a line."},"2116":{"dur":2,"text":"So here's a line,\nwhich is stroked--"},"2119":{"dur":1,"text":"which goes from left to right."},"2121":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can set these\ntrim properties,"},"2123":{"dur":2,"text":"which basically say how much--\nwhich portion of the line"},"2125":{"dur":0,"text":"you draw."},"2126":{"dur":4,"text":"So if I set a trim end of 0.75,\nit means from 75% of the way"},"2131":{"dur":2,"text":"to the end won't be drawn."},"2133":{"dur":3,"text":"And similarly, if you set\nfrom trimStart of 0.5, then"},"2136":{"dur":2,"text":"the first half won't get drawn."},"2139":{"dur":1,"text":"So knowing how\nthat works, we can"},"2141":{"dur":2,"text":"see this is actually\njust four lines."},"2143":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's one line which joins\nat that stem, as I call it."},"2146":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's two lines\nfor the arrowhead"},"2148":{"dur":2,"text":"and one line for the\ncircle at the top."},"2150":{"dur":2,"text":"And all we do is we\nanimate the trim start"},"2153":{"dur":3,"text":"and end values in order to get\nit to trace out this animation."},"2156":{"dur":3,"text":"So the arrowhead and the circles\nare going to go completely,"},"2160":{"dur":1,"text":"clipping it to make it hide."},"2161":{"dur":2,"text":"Whereas the stem thing-- part\nof it's always on screen."},"2164":{"dur":2,"text":"We never actually trim the\nwhole thing, as it were."},"2166":{"dur":2,"text":"It just animates\nbetween the two states."},"2169":{"dur":2,"text":"Notice also that the\nstretching out of the lines."},"2172":{"dur":2,"text":"As it stretches out,\nthis is really, really"},"2174":{"dur":2,"text":"easily achieved just by\nsetting different durations"},"2176":{"dur":2,"text":"for animating the start and end."},"2179":{"dur":1,"text":"So here's how you build it."},"2181":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is one vector drawable."},"2182":{"dur":1,"text":"Like I say, there's four lines."},"2184":{"dur":2,"text":"So each of these path\nobjects is a line."},"2186":{"dur":2,"text":"So it has a name, so you\ncan identify it later on."},"2188":{"dur":1,"text":"And a couple of\nprotips for building"},"2190":{"dur":2,"text":"these things I\nfound really helpful"},"2193":{"dur":2,"text":"is to create a resources file,\nlike a regular resources file"},"2195":{"dur":2,"text":"that you put your strings\nand ints and stuff in."},"2197":{"dur":2,"text":"And reference that and put\nthe paths and the fraction"},"2200":{"dur":1,"text":"of the trim values in\nthat, because if you're"},"2202":{"dur":1,"text":"going to refer to\nthese a few times,"},"2204":{"dur":3,"text":"it makes it easier to\nonly have it in one place."},"2207":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you define\nobject animators"},"2209":{"dur":2,"text":"for animating each\nof those properties."},"2211":{"dur":2,"text":"So here's one where we're\nanimating the trim start"},"2213":{"dur":0,"text":"and end."},"2214":{"dur":2,"text":"And then here, referencing\nout to those fractions"},"2216":{"dur":1,"text":"that I want to trim to."},"2217":{"dur":2,"text":"And again, this is where\nsetting a different duration"},"2219":{"dur":2,"text":"allows you to have that\nstretching out and coming back"},"2222":{"dur":2,"text":"together feel really,\nreally simply."},"2224":{"dur":1,"text":"Then the last\npiece of the puzzle"},"2225":{"dur":2,"text":"is the animated vector,\nwhich pulls together"},"2227":{"dur":2,"text":"the drawable and the animator."},"2229":{"dur":1,"text":"And says, what to run it on."},"2231":{"dur":1,"text":"So here you identify it by name."},"2233":{"dur":1,"text":"So on that stem,\nrun this animator."},"2237":{"dur":2,"text":"And then finally, to use it,\nyou just load it as a drawable,"},"2240":{"dur":2,"text":"set it on ImageView\nand call start."},"2243":{"dur":2,"text":"So hopefully you can see,\nmaybe a bit of effort,"},"2246":{"dur":3,"text":"but I think worth it for the\nquality of some character"},"2250":{"dur":1,"text":"to the application."},"2251":{"dur":1,"text":"So I want to call\nout-- this is the way"},"2253":{"dur":2,"text":"to run an AVD for a\none-shot type operation,"},"2255":{"dur":1,"text":"just to run the animation."},"2257":{"dur":4,"text":"But a nice way you can do it\nis often to do state changes."},"2261":{"dur":2,"text":"So for example, here\nis when you like"},"2264":{"dur":2,"text":"or unlike a shot on Dribbble."},"2267":{"dur":3,"text":"Basically you have animations\nbetween those two states."},"2271":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you like\nit, it's basically--"},"2273":{"dur":1,"text":"there's two versions\nof the heart."},"2275":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a stroked version\nwith a filled version on top,"},"2277":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you apply\na clip, which you"},"2279":{"dur":1,"text":"animate the clip\nup and down, which"},"2281":{"dur":1,"text":"gives you this filling up."},"2282":{"dur":2,"text":"And unliking is basically,\ntwo paths and you just"},"2285":{"dur":3,"text":"rotate and fade them, and then\ndo the the trim line thing."},"2288":{"dur":3,"text":"That's a fun little\nanimation that you can write."},"2291":{"dur":2,"text":"But Android offers you\nthis animated selector,"},"2293":{"dur":1,"text":"which makes it way easier."},"2294":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't have to manually\nrun all these animations"},"2297":{"dur":1,"text":"all the time."},"2298":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a bit like a\ndrawable selector."},"2300":{"dur":3,"text":"So you have states like,\nfor example, the FAB"},"2303":{"dur":0,"text":"is just checkable."},"2304":{"dur":5,"text":"So when you press it,\nit's state checked."},"2310":{"dur":3,"text":"But the animated selector,\nunlike its regular selector"},"2313":{"dur":2,"text":"cousin, lets you\ndefine a animation"},"2316":{"dur":2,"text":"to run when moving from one\nof these states to another."},"2318":{"dur":2,"text":"So when it goes from\nchecked to unchecked,"},"2321":{"dur":4,"text":"it will run that animated vector\ndrawable, the avd_heart_break."},"2325":{"dur":1,"text":"And you'll get that\nnice little animation."},"2330":{"dur":2,"text":"So here's just a few\nmore examples of where"},"2333":{"dur":2,"text":"we've used little animations."},"2335":{"dur":2,"text":"I really, really, really\nbelieve that these"},"2338":{"dur":3,"text":"are a real opportunity to\nbring character and whimsy"},"2341":{"dur":2,"text":"to your application, and\nmake it more fun to use,"},"2343":{"dur":2,"text":"have more personality."},"2346":{"dur":1,"text":"You might think,\nare these necessary?"},"2347":{"dur":2,"text":"Are these strictly necessary\nto make your
