introduce\nhim and welcome him tonight."},"69":{"dur":2,"text":"So just get on with\nour first program."},"71":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you very much."},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you very much, Nora."},"75":{"dur":4,"text":"Thank you for braving\nthe rain and cold."},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"We're pretty excited\nto have rain."},"82":{"dur":6,"text":"So what I want to do tonight\nis talk to you about hair."},"88":{"dur":2,"text":"It's something that's\non our mind a lot."},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"It's dispensable, but important."},"95":{"dur":4,"text":"What I hope you'll understand\ntonight is that it is an organ."},"100":{"dur":3,"text":"And each hair is an organ\nwhich is like all other organs"},"103":{"dur":1,"text":"in the body."},"105":{"dur":4,"text":"And it is a window into how\nwe can regenerate other organs"},"109":{"dur":4,"text":"like the lung and the liver."},"114":{"dur":2,"text":"It's really a model\nfor stem cell biology"},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"because the things you\ntalk about for hair growth"},"119":{"dur":1,"text":"are the same things\nwe talk about"},"120":{"dur":3,"text":"for trying to regenerate lung\nand liver, bone, cartilage,"},"123":{"dur":0,"text":"and that sort of thing."},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that's why I hope\nwe'll get to tonight."},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the title, Hair\nToday, Gone Tomorrow"},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"really will be an\nimportant thing."},"132":{"dur":3,"text":"What I want to point\nout is that our clinic,"},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"in case you don't know, is\nthe Stanford Health clinic."},"138":{"dur":4,"text":"It's over on Redwood City and\nin the Stanford Outpatient"},"142":{"dur":0,"text":"Medicine Facility."},"143":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's part of a brand

really it's a\nbrand new outpatient"},"158":{"dur":2,"text":"medical campus there."},"161":{"dur":0,"text":"They just broke ground."},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"So basically all it is is just\nflat except for our outpatient"},"164":{"dur":0,"text":"building."},"165":{"dur":4,"text":"And I hope you'll\nvisit sometime soon."},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"What I'd like to do today is,\nthis is sort of the schedule"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"that I'd like to\ntalk about today."},"174":{"dur":1,"text":"A little bit about hair biology."},"176":{"dur":3,"text":"What is normal hair aging?"},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"Soil and seed factors,\nhair color and then"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"preventing the immune system\nfrom ruining your hair"},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"and give you a bad hair day."},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"This is hopefully interactive."},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"And so if you have questions,\nplease raise your hand"},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"and discuss with me."},"194":{"dur":1,"text":"If not, then we can\nwait to the end,"},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"and we'll have a session,\na Q&A session at the end,"},"197":{"dur":1,"text":"to get you an answer\nto the questions."},"199":{"dur":1,"text":"All right?"},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I want to do tonight\nis to talk to you about,"},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"at first to start,\nis about hair growth."},"206":{"dur":6,"text":"And hair growth really is\na matter of seeds and soil."},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that's really what\nwe want you to think about."},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"Every hair on your head,\nall thousands of them,"},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"come out of a group of stem\ncells that make a hair."},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's basically\ngroups of 10,000 of hairs,"},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"of little stem cell\npockets on your scalp, that"},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"grow a hair out."},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's the hair stem cell."},"235":{"dur":4,"text":"But around those stem cells,\nthese guys right here,"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"these little stem cells\nhere, this is a stem cell."},"242":{"dur":6,"text":"But around the stem cell are\na whole micro environment"},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"called the soil."},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"Its micro-environment,\nor stem cell niche,"},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"however you what to call it, but\nreally it informs the stem cell"},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"when and where to grow."},"258":{"dur":5,"text":"And there's blood vessels and\nnerves and big fat adipocytes,"},"263":{"dur":3,"text":"fat cells, that\nsecrete factors that"},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"cause the hair to\ngrow in response"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"to metabolic conditions\nin your body."},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"And so really these\nlittle buggers,"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"the groups of stem cells\nthat make the hair grow,"},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"are bio-sensors\nfor the body that"},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"sense what's going\non minute to minute"},"285":{"dur":4,"text":"and then read that out in\nterms of how the hair grows."},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"Because the hairs are\njust a bunch of protein"},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"that's being excreted."},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's a big energy\ndrain on the body"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"to put out 10,000 of\nthese guys at a time."},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"And so if the machine\nis not working,"},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"it doesn't want to put it out."},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that's really the issue."},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"These little bio-sensors, these\nstem cells, read out the body"},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"and then make the hair grow."},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"So it really is like\nlittle seeds and soil."},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is actually\na picture of the soil"},"322":{"dur":4,"text":"here, for example,\nhere are blood vessels."},"326":{"dur":3,"text":"And the nerve fibers wrap\nright around the stem cells."},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"So, for example, we'll\ntalk about stress,"},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"our emotional state."},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"There's little peptides\nthat are coming"},"336":{"dur":4,"text":"from the nerves that actually\nwill affect the stem cells."},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"These are big adipocytes."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"If you have a crash\ndiet the factors here"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"that make the hair grow\nwill go away and then"},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"the hair won't grow."},"348":{"dur":4,"text":"And so these are bio\nsensors that make it grow."},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"Hair growth is a matter\nof seed and soil."},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"The seeds are the things that\nmake different types of hair."},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"They code the instructions."},"364":{"dur":4,"text":"On the left there you can see\ndifferent kinds of hair color."},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"The seeds are very similar\nto, for example, a peacock,"},"370":{"dur":0,"text":"feathers."},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"Each one of the\nfeather stem cells"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"rather than making a\nhair makes feather."},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"Those are also\ngenetically encoded"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"and actually we can\nspend a whole evening"},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"talking about feather biology."},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"Which is very similar to hair\nbiology and how birds fly."},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"And they have to fly\nin a very perfect way."},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"And different animals have\ndifferent length hair."},"391":{"dur":5,"text":"So, for example, a mouse grows\nvery similar to a human hair"},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"but only grows about\nan inch and a half"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"because the growth cycle,\nthe season I'll talk about,"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"is very short."},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"And the bunny does\nthe same thing."},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"But there are mutants,\nthere are rabbit mutants,"},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"called Angora where they're\njust a big ball of fur"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"because the hair\ndoesn't stop growing."},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's really what\nwe're seeing today"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"is we're going to talk about\nthe seeds and the soil."},"417":{"dur":0,"text":"OK?"},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, welcome."},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"So the basic bottom line\nfor tonight is this."},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"There are different\nkinds of soil."},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"Here you go."},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"And in different\nparts of the body"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"there are different\nkinds of soil."},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"And the seeds are\ndifferent as well."},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"So these are little green\nbean seeds and these"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"are yellow ones."},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"So they're very similar."},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"They make different\nkinds of hair."},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"These would make different\nqualities of hair."},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"And so if you put these\nseeds, and this is basically"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"how hair development works,\nthis is developmental biology"},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"right here, OK?"},"458":{"dur":3,"text":"Basically what they do\nis, during development,"},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"the stem cells are set apart."},"464":{"dur":5,"text":"And the skin is\nactually pulled apart"},"470":{"dur":4,"text":"and the stem cells are put into\nthe cell underneath the skin"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"and they start to grow."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"But they're encoded and\nmake a different kind."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"So one kind makes\nthis kind of hair"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're encoded, the\nother kind are encoded,"},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"to make this kind of hair."},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"And so if you look\non your scalp there's"},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"terminal hairs, big\nthick Redwood trees."},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"On your arm they're different,\nthey're vellus hairs."},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"They're very tiny ones."},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"So different parts,\ndifferent soils."},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"Different parts of the body\nhave different kinds of hair."},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"It's genetically encoded."},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"But how they grow and the\nquality where they grow"},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"and when they grow is\ndetermined by the soil"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"that they're growing in."},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"And I would suggest\nto you tonight"},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"that all of the hair biology\nthat you need to know"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"is right here because most of\nthe hair diseases that we're"},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"talking about are\neither problems"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"with the seeds or problems\nwith the quality of the soil."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'll talk about\nmore of that tonight, OK?"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"Questions about that?"},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"So now you know\nabout hair biology."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can go home because\nthat's all you need to know."},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"So we know seeds and soil\nbut what about the seasons?"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's a, again, genetically\nencoded season length"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"of how far the hair grows."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"So the seeds are encoded\nand they grow out the hair."},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"But why, for example, does\na human hair grow down"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"to your waist whereas a\nmouse hair is this long?"},"560":{"dur":0,"text":"Does it grow faster?"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"No, it grows about the same\nrate, but the season of growth"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"is much longer."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, for example,\na human hair"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"grows about that much\na month, as you know,"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"but the season is\nabout four years."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's why it keeps growing\nand growing and growing."},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you go\ndown to your waist."},"581":{"dur":5,"text":"And then at that point,\nthere's a cycle, shown here,"},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"where the hair pops out\nthis hair growth here"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"and then it basically stops."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"And the real question\nthat biologists"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"are trying to figure\nout is why does it stop?"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"But it actually knows\nhow to tell time."},"600":{"dur":3,"text":"It stops and then basically\nrest and sits there."},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"And the hair stops\ngrowing, it's this long."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"And then basically\nit ejects the hair"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"and then another one starts\ngrowing for four years."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the hair cycle."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"That happens and\nthere's a counter."},"615":{"dur":6,"text":"The seeds have about 40\ngrowth seasons in their DNA."},"622":{"dur":4,"text":"And so if it's two to four\nyears and there's like 40 cycles"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"it's around 80."},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's your lifetime."},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's hair biology."},"631":{"dur":4,"text":"It's 40 cycles of about\ntwo years, on average."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's why your\nhair is this long."},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, is that clear?"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"Super important."},"642":{"dur":5,"text":"And this is a picture of the old\nhair that's in a resting phase."},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"And then the new hair production\nfacility has grown out."},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"And the hair has grown\nout here and it's"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"going to basically\nkick that old one out."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"And this new one is going\nto come out this way"},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"and then make a new hair\nout of the same hole."},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"40 times in your lifetime\nout of the same hole."},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"Now what you have to understand\nin terms of understanding hair"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"biology and hair\ndisease is this,"},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"that each hair on your head\nis in a different stage"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"of that two year cycle."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's kind of\nlike the freeway."},"679":{"dur":5,"text":"So 100 cars get on the\nfreeway and 100 cars get off."},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"And so it looks like\nthere's the same number"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"of cars on the freeway\nat the same time."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"The flux is the same."},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"So on average if I stood\nhere and watched you today"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"and counted all the hairs\nthat came off in the drain,"},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"in your comb, as you\nroll the window down,"},"703":{"dur":0,"text":"you lose about 100."},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"That's normal."},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"So 100 hairs is normal."},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"They eject them\nout and then there"},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"are new ones are growing\nout there at the same time."},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"The reason why that happens\nis because the hair,"},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"they can adapt to different\nenvironmental changes,"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"different metabolic changes,\ndifferent stress changes."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"And that allows the body to\nadapt to different environments"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"because these little bio sensors\nare down there figuring out"},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"what's going on in the\nbody, metabolically,"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"and stress, and\nhormonally, and then"},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"that's how they're growing."},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"So one of the coolest\norgans in the world."},"737":{"dur":4,"text":"I hope you appreciate how this\nworks because it's really cool."},"741":{"dur":0,"text":"Yep?"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"Fast question, so if\nsometimes your hair gets"},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"caught and it pulls out."},"745":{"dur":5,"text":"So would it have to wait for\nwhenever that new cell was"},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"coming to get out?"},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"Or would it push it\nto go out faster?"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, so that's a good question."},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's say this is your\nhair and it gets yanked out."},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"It turns out that if\nthis guy is about ready"},"760":{"dur":4,"text":"to go out, start going, it'll\nactually start the process."},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"If it's not ready its--"},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll take a little longer\nbut it'll regenerate."},"769":{"dur":9,"text":"Yeah, so it's as long as you\ndon't pull out the seeds,"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"it'll regrow."},"780":{"dur":0,"text":"They're a little deep."},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, so depends how you yank."},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's an important question."},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you just pull the\nhair out, so this is the hair"},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"but the seeds are actually down\nhere, and if you pull this out"},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"then it will regrow."},"794":{"dur":3,"text":"OK, is that quick?"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"All right, so we\ntalked about seasons."},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's around 40 seasons."},"803":{"dur":5,"text":"And each season is about two\nyears and the flux is variance."},"808":{"dur":7,"text":"And so as a quiz, what\nhappens if there's a traffic"},"816":{"dur":5,"text":"break on the freeway,\nand then you suddenly"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"release the traffic break."},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"What would you see?"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"How many cars come by?"},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"Usually you get 10 a minute."},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"Traffic break they all pile\nup and then you release it."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"How many would come at a time?"},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"[INAUDIBLE]"},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"Exactly, you'd get a lot more."},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, so you'd see a lot\nmore coming by, right?"},"846":{"dur":4,"text":"So because of that, if you start\nto see a lot of hair coming out"},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"Either because it's coming out\nabnormally or because it got"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"clogged up for a while\nand then released"},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's all coming out at once."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a transient."},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you have a traffic\nbreak and then for a while"},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"it piles up but then\nit kind of evens out"},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"and goes back to where it was."},"868":{"dur":0,"text":"OK, is that clear?"},"869":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a huge\nthing because a lot"},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"of disease I'll\ntalk about later on"},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"is an apparent hair loss called\ntelogen effluvium, that's"},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"the name."},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's really because\nthey all piled up at once"},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"and they all came out."},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's one thing you have\nto think about, all right?"},"887":{"dur":0,"text":"Good answer."},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"If you understand the\nseasons, then this"},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"is a great cartoon where there's\na guy with horns on his head."},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"And horns are actually\nare like hair,"},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"they actually fall off\nduring the seasons."},"899":{"dur":1,"text":"And the doctor says, well\nbefore trying surgery,"},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"I'd like to wait and see if you\njust shed them in the spring."},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"So a lot of the things\nthat actually are abnormal,"},"908":{"dur":2,"text":"that thing is\nconstantly turning over,"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"it will fix itself if\nyou just wait long enough"},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"for the next season."},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's part of what\nwe have to think about"},"917":{"dur":3,"text":"with hair disorders because\nthat's an important thing."},"921":{"dur":1,"text":"Texture."},"923":{"dur":2,"text":"The composition of the\nhair, the little protein"},"925":{"dur":2,"text":"tube that comes out, which is\nthe hair, the hair keratins,"},"928":{"dur":1,"text":"is genetically encoded."},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"And you know that because\nof animals like sheep."},"933":{"dur":2,"text":"These are inbred\nlines of sheep that"},"935":{"dur":5,"text":"have very specific kinds\nof proteins in their wool"},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"that give them the quality of\nthe hair, keratin, the wool"},"945":{"dur":3,"text":"keratin, which is just like the\nhair keratin, that gives them"},"948":{"dur":3,"text":"the properties for the sweaters\nand coats that you make."},"951":{"dur":5,"text":"For example, very famous\nMerino wool is curly."},"957":{"dur":4,"text":"So what it does is\nit really curls up."},"961":{"dur":1,"text":"So when you pack\nit together it's"},"963":{"dur":2,"text":"curly so it actually\nprovides a lot of air."},"965":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's a lot of breathing."},"968":{"dur":3,"text":"Whereas Dorper hybrid wool\nis actually flat and so"},"972":{"dur":4,"text":"when you make a sweater of\nthis, it's very dense and warm."},"976":{"dur":4,"text":"That was specifically encoded\nby these sheep farmers."},"980":{"dur":2,"text":"The types of hair protein\nkeratins that are made"},"983":{"dur":4,"text":"determine the quality of\nthe hair and the kinkiness."},"988":{"dur":2,"text":"Also the length and the\nduration is also encoded."},"991":{"dur":3,"text":"So they actually can\nbreed these animals"},"994":{"dur":3,"text":"for exactly the length of the\nseason, length of the hair,"},"998":{"dur":5,"text":"the quality of the hair,\nthe color to make products."},"1003":{"dur":4,"text":"Now what happens\nwhen we get older?"},"1007":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is an\nimportant question."},"1009":{"dur":5,"text":"And so there's a\nwarranty for these seeds."},"1014":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's different seasons."},"1018":{"dur":4,"text":"And some of these seeds\ncan grow for 40 seasons."},"1022":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of them can\ngrow for 20
