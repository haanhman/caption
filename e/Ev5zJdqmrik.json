recognized in\nthe American Psychiatric"},"633":{"dur":5,"text":"Association's DSM\nI think in 1983."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"But it is now something that\nwe all just take axiomatically,"},"643":{"dur":5,"text":"that if something traumatic\nhappens, you need to deal with."},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"And what's been fascinating\nin those years since 1983,"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think in interesting\nways rather uninterrogated,"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"is the ways in which\nwhat began as a diagnosis"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"for an individual\npsyche has increasingly"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"become, through the\nuse of metaphor,"},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"a way in which we talk\nabout collectives,"},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"and we talk about\nentire human society."},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"So we now routinely\ntalk about societies"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"having traumatic histories,\nand about the

litigation."},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"Some lawsuits were filed."},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"In the end, those lawsuits\nwere consolidated and heard"},"797":{"dur":4,"text":"in federal court in\n2004 and thrown out."},"801":{"dur":4,"text":"But, the fact is, that again,\nwhen the events at Brown"},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"happened, there were just a\nhost of broad
