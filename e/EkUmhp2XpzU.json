2002 we've been developing these gardens"},"12":{"dur":4,"text":"as an extension of the interpretation of the Tudor hall."},"16":{"dur":3,"text":"We have a kitchen garden where I am now."},"20":{"dur":2,"text":"Here they would have grown a range"},"22":{"dur":2,"text":"of useful plants for use in the hall."},"24":{"dur":1,"text":"Such as mint"},"26":{"dur":3,"text":"which was a good cure for stomach complaints"},"30":{"dur":4,"text":"Marigold which was used for lightening the hair"},"34":{"dur":4,"text":"and sage which is said to be a cure for baldness."},"39":{"dur":4,"text":"We also have a beautiful flower border."},"43":{"dur":4,"text":"We have an extensive range of fruit trees and fruiting plants."},"48":{"dur":2,"text":"And we also have wide lawns"},"50":{"dur":3,"text":"where we do a huge number of events every year."},"54":{"dur":4,"text":"Please listen further to find out more about lavender,"},"58":{"dur":3,"text":"which is really at its best this time of year."},"61":{"dur":1,"text":"And listen on later in the year"},"63":{"dur":3,"text":"to find out more about apples and Christmas."},"68":{"dur":1,"text":"[Music]"},"83":{"dur":3,"text":"Welcome to Blakesley Hall, please follow me inside."},"88":{"dur":1,"text":"It is often thought that the Tudors"},"90":{"dur":1,"text":"were a very smelly bunch of people."},"92":{"dur":1,"text":"They certainly did not care for washing"},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"and they certainly weren't bothered by bad smells."},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"However this is far from the truth."},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"They were very concerned with how they smelt personally"},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"and also how their homes smelt."},"103":{"dur":4,"text":"And a lot of time and effort was spent in masking these smells."},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"Now for most people during the Tudor period"},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"a daily bath would not have been possible."},"112":{"dur":1,"text":"It would have been very inconvenient"},"114":{"dur":2,"text":"and also very time consuming."},"116":{"dur":1,"text":"However, what we do know"},"117":{"dur":2,"text":"is that they would have actually had a daily wash"},"119":{"dur":2,"text":"using water in a bowel just like this."},"122":{"dur":1,"text":"In household manuals of the day"},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"they are giving an abundance of recipes"},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"for something called 'washing waters'."},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"Now washing waters were simply water"},"130":{"dur":3,"text":"put into a bowl with herbs such as lavender added to it."},"133":{"dur":1,"text":"And the idea was"},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"that the herbs would make the water very fragrant"},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"and make the person smell very nice."},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"Now this was incredibly important"},"141":{"dur":1,"text":"for the less well off in society"},"143":{"dur":1,"text":"because they use soap."},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"Soap that was made of animal fat or tallow."},"147":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you imagine..."},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"really not very pleasant smelling."},"151":{"dur":1,"text":"So the water with the herbs in"},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"would have counteracted this."},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"It also became very popular for people to wear perfume."},"159":{"dur":1,"text":"Originally this was thought to again"},"160":{"dur":2,"text":"mask the odour coming from a person."},"163":{"dur":1,"text":"However what they now think"},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"is that it was used a status symbol."},"166":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is because the spices and herbs used to make"},"170":{"dur":3,"text":"perfume had to be imported from foreign countries."},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"Now to import something cost a lot money"},"176":{"dur":3,"text":"so in order to do that you have to be very wealthy indeed."},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you could afford to import theses spices"},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"and wear perfume"},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"people knew you were very rich."},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"However what did become very popular"},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"and a lot cheaper"},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"during the 15th and 16th century"},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"was the idea of wearing a tussy mussy."},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"Now a tussy mussy is a small sweet smelling bouquet"},"197":{"dur":1,"text":"that the ladies and gentleman"},"198":{"dur":3,"text":"would have worn upon there clothing."},"201":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was very easy to make"},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"and also a lot cheaper than perfume."},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"You at home can also make one"},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"all you need is one sweet smelling flower"},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"here I have a rose"},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"surround it with springs of lavender"},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"or other beautiful smelling herbs."},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"And they would have tied a ribbon"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"around the bottom of it, like so."},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"And then attach this to there clothing"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"and this would have ensured that they constantly had"},"223":{"dur":4,"text":"a nice fragrant smell coming from this tussy mussy."},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"Now we know that the Tudors spent a lot of time"},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"trying to make their person smell as lovely as possible."},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"But they also spent a lot of time"},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to make their home equally as fragrant."},"238":{"dur":3,"text":"Here in the great hall the floor is not original."},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"The floor would have been about a foot lower"},"243":{"dur":1,"text":"when the house was first built."},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"And it would have been made of ox blood,"},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"dung and soil."},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"So as you can imagine, really quite wiffy."},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"Now the servants would have tried to cover this smell up"},"254":{"dur":1,"text":"as much as possible"},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"particularly if the family had guests."},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"And what they would have done"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"is they would have laid some rushes along the floor"},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"on top of this they would have laid herbs like lavender."},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"Now the idea was when these herbs were walked on"},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"and crushed underfoot"},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"they would have released a very sweet smelling"},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"fragrance thus masking the smell of the floor."},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"Another useful thing they did was create lavender bags."},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"Now they would have made these"},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"using a small piece of fabric, like so"},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"they would have put the lavender inside"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"tied them up, attached a ribbon"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"then hung them in the rooms of the house."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"Now we know this worked because there is"},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"text that says so"},"292":{"dur":1,"text":"one such verse says"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"'Hung up in houses doth very well a temper"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"to cool and make fresh the place"},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"to the comforts and pleasure of those there in.'"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"So obviously lavender bags did work."},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"Lavender was also cited"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"as an excellent deterrent for pests."},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"For some reason they thought that pests"},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"were put off by lavender."},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"So because of this lavender sprigs"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"were put in the mattress to deter vermin."},"317":{"dur":4,"text":"And also lavender sprigs were put into clothes chests."},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"This had two benefits"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"firstly it meant that moths"},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"were deterred from eating the clothes"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"which would be very important"},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"particularly if the family were wealthy"},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"and therefore had fine silks and velvets."},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"And secondly it also meant"},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"that when they did want to use them"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"they already smelt very sweetly of lavender"},"338":{"dur":4,"text":"rather than a musty clothes storage smell."},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"I really hope this video has shown you"},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"some of the ways in which lavender"},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"was used inside the Tudor home."},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"[Music]"}}
