insight is"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species,"},"473":{"dur":4,"text":"the unconscious mind does most of the work."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"And so one way to formulate that is"},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute,"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"of which it can be consciously aware of about 40."},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"And this leads to oddities."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"One of my favorite is that people named Dennis"},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"are disproportionately likely to become dentists,"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"people named Lawrence become lawyers,"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"because unconsciously we gravitate toward things"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"that sound familiar,"},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"which is why I named my daughter President of the United States Brooks."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"(Laughter)"},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"Another finding is that the unconscious,"},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"far from being dumb and sexualized,"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"is actually quite smart."},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"So one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture."},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"It's really hard to imagine a sofa, how it's going to look in your house."},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"And the way you should do that"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"is study the furniture,"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"let it marinate in your mind, distract yourself,"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"and then a few days later, go with your gut,"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"because unconsciously you've figured it out."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"The second insight"},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"is that emotions are at the center of our thinking."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"People with strokes and lesions"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"in the emotion-processing parts of the brain"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"are not super smart,"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"they're actually sometimes quite helpless."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"And the \"giant\" in the field is in the room tonight"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"and is speaking tomorrow morning -- Antonio Damasio."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the things he's really shown us"},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"is that emotions are not separate from reason,"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"but they are the foundation of reason"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"because they tell us what to value."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"And so reading and educating your emotions"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"is one of the central activities of wisdom."},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I'm a middle-aged guy."},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not exactly comfortable with emotions."},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"One of my favorite brain stories described these middle-aged guys."},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"They put them into a brain scan machine --"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"this is apocryphal by the way, but I don't care --"},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"and they had them watch a horror movie,"},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives."},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"And the brain scans were identical in both activities."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"It was just sheer terror."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"So me talking about emotion"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"is like Gandhi talking about gluttony,"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"but it is the central organizing process"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"of the way we think."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"It tells us what to imprint."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"The brain is the record of the feelings of a life."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"And the third insight"},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"is that we're not primarily self-contained individuals."},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"We're social animals, not rational animals."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"We emerge out of relationships,"},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"and we are deeply interpenetrated, one with another."},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"And so when we see another person,"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"we reenact in our own minds"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"what we see in their minds."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"When we watch a car chase in a movie,"},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"it's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase."},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"When we watch pornography,"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"it's a little like having sex,"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"though probably not as good."},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"And we see this when lovers walk down the street,"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"when a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"gets caught up in an emotional contagion,"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"the deep interpenetration."},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"And this revolution in who we are"},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"gives us a different way of seeing, I think, politics,"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"a different way, most importantly,"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"of seeing human capital."},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"We are now children of the French Enlightenment."},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"We believe that reason is the highest of the faculties."},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think this research shows"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"that the British Enlightenment, or the Scottish Enlightenment,"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"with David Hume, Adam Smith,"},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"actually had a better handle on who we are --"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"that reason is often weak, our sentiments are strong,"},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"and our sentiments are often trustworthy."},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"And this work corrects that bias in our culture,"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"that dehumanizing bias."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"It gives us a deeper sense"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"of what it actually takes"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"for us to thrive in this life."},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"When we think about human capital"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"we think about the things we can measure easily --"},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"things like grades, SAT's, degrees,"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"the number of years in schooling."},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"What it really takes to do well, to lead a meaningful life,"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"are things that are deeper,"},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"things we don't really even have words for."},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"And so let me list just a couple of the things"},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"I think this research points us toward trying to understand."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"The first gift, or talent, is mindsight --"},"706":{"dur":4,"text":"the ability to enter into other people's minds"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"and learn what they have to offer."},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"Babies come with this ability."},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"Meltzoff, who's at the University of

back."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"Babies are born to interpenetrate into Mom's mind"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"and to download what they find --"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"their models of how to understand

relationships."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"They are what we call avoidantly attached."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"They have trouble relating to other people."},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"They go through life"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"like sailboats tacking into the wind --"},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"wanting to get close to people,"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"but not really having the models of how to do that."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"And so this is one skill"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"of how to hoover up knowledge, one from another."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"A second skill is equipoise,"},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"the ability to have the serenity"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"to read the biases and failures in your own mind."},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"So for example, we are overconfidence machines."},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"Ninety-five percent of our professors report"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"that they are above-average teachers."},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"Ninety-six percent of college students"},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"say they have above-average social skills."},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"Time magazine asked Americans, \"Are you in the top one percent of

the way."},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"Men drown at twice the rate of women,"},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"because men think they can swim across that lake."},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"But some people have the ability and awareness"},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"of their own biases, their own overconfidence."},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"They have epistemological modesty."},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"They are open-minded

it,"},"853":{"dur":3,"text":"but they could feel cold, they felt a coldness,"},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"and they were more often right than wrong."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"The third is what you might call sympathy,"},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"the ability to work within groups."},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"And that comes in tremendously handy,"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"because groups are smarter than individuals."},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"And face-to-face groups are much smarter"},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"than groups that communicate electronically,"},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"because 90 percent of our
