{"4":{"dur":2,"text":"Thomas Ried:\nThank you very much."},"7":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm glad it worked out finally."},"9":{"dur":8,"text":"So, the title of my talk is Genome and Transcriptome\nDynamics in

kind of an\nintroduction to the second topics when we"},"61":{"dur":6,"text":"-- I discuss briefly what the consequences\nof this cytogenetic abnormalities are under"},"68":{"dur":5,"text":"transcriptome, under gene expression in cancer\ncells, and then I will exploit what we can"},"74":{"dur":9,"text":"do in order to translate what we have learned\nfrom these more basic research topics to translational"},"83":{"dur":9,"text":"medicine, both in terms of genomic aberrations\nand alterations of the transcriptome."},"92":{"dur":6,"text":"What you see here are chromosomes from a patient\nwith chronic myelogenous leukemia."},"99":{"dur":7,"text":"And you can see there is a single chromosomal\ntranslocation between chromosome 9 and 22,"},"106":{"dur":6,"text":"and at this point, I have to pause and acknowledge\nJanet Rowley who actually discovered the balanced"},"113":{"dur":2,"text":"nature of this chromosomal translocation."},"115":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, this slide was performed in collaboration\nwith her."},"120":{"dur":3,"text":"She unfortunately passed away just two

she\nserved as scientific advisor since its inception."},"136":{"dur":7,"text":"And, as you know, this translocation has profound\neffects not only in terms of diagnosis but"},"144":{"dur":6,"text":"in for treatment because if you target the\ngenetic event which is the fusion of bcr and"},"150":{"dur":6,"text":"abl, which results in [unintelligible] tyrosine\nkinase signal with a drug, you can get these"},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"patients into remission."},"159":{"dur":8,"text":"And the paradigm of chromosomal translocation\nnot only applies to CML but to many other"},"167":{"dur":5,"text":"hematological malignancies as well, which\nsome of them are listed here."},"173":{"dur":6,"text":"But I chose to show you this slide for another\nreason as well which is, clearly, there is"},"180":{"dur":7,"text":"one genetic event which we now -- causes transformation,\nbut you can also appreciate that the rest"},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"of the genome remains normal."},"189":{"dur":7,"text":"So, what it is that there is a single genetic\nevent which is sufficient to transform these"},"196":{"dur":3,"text":"hematological cells."},"199":{"dur":5,"text":"If you look at solid tumors, carcinomas in\nparticular, tumors of epithelial origins,"},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"the picture changes dramatically."},"208":{"dur":8,"text":"Here is a normal karyotype and here is the\nmetaphases from breast cancer cell, SkBr3."},"216":{"dur":7,"text":"And you can see a profound degree of chromosomal\ninstability, not only numerically but also"},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"structurally."},"225":{"dur":5,"text":"Then you can see giant mark of chromosomes\nwhich are a reflection of oncogene amplification,"},"230":{"dur":5,"text":"in this case dysemic [spelled phonetically]\nand the HER2\/neu oncogene."},"236":{"dur":4,"text":"Then you have other features -- this is probably\na little dark -- in cancer cells which we"},"240":{"dur":6,"text":"call aneuploidy which is affected in an enormous\ndegree of variability in the DNA content from"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"one cell to another."},"249":{"dur":6,"text":"You can also appreciate a polar mitosis which\nwill clearly lead to chromosome -- to a different"},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"chromosome count in the cells."},"258":{"dur":6,"text":"You can see phenomenon of anaphase, which\nresults in lost chromosome and is caused by"},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"telomere attrition."},"266":{"dur":8,"text":"So, pictures like this and this lead to the\nperception that if you look at most solid"},"275":{"dur":5,"text":"tumors in adults, it looks like someone set\noff a bomb in the nucleus."},"281":{"dur":6,"text":"And this perception lead to the interpretation\nthat in solid tumors, different from the hematological"},"288":{"dur":6,"text":"malignancies, we have a cytogenetic of chaos\nwhich is induced by catastrophic mitosis -- you"},"295":{"dur":7,"text":"have seen one -- karyotypic complexity, heterogeneity\nof the tumor-cell population, and ongoing"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"chromosomal instability."},"304":{"dur":6,"text":"The perception of a cytogenetic chaos also\nled to the perception that chromosomal aberrations"},"311":{"dur":5,"text":"in solid tumors, different from the hematological\nmalignancies, would rather be a consequence"},"316":{"dur":7,"text":"--would be a consequence rather than the course\nof the disease."},"324":{"dur":8,"text":"And what I will show you now is -- I will\ndiscuss whether this is indeed the case."},"332":{"dur":7,"text":"Arguably, we had to develop methodologies\nto dissect the complex aberrations in solid"},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"tumors."},"341":{"dur":5,"text":"Most important was comparative genomic hybridization;\nI will show more details later."},"347":{"dur":6,"text":"But, in short, it allows you to map genomic\nimbalance in the entire tumor-cell population."},"353":{"dur":5,"text":"We have spectral karyotyping, which we developed\nyears ago, which allows you to paint all chromosomes"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"in different colors."},"361":{"dur":8,"text":"And then we can used specific probes to enumerate\nchromosomal copy numbers directly in non-dividing"},"369":{"dur":6,"text":"cells, psychological preparations or tissue\nsections, and it can also be used to identify"},"376":{"dur":4,"text":"translocation because you see a fusion of\ndifferent colors."},"380":{"dur":5,"text":"And now with the advent of global gene expression\nprofiling or sequencing, we can interpret"},"386":{"dur":7,"text":"and query how these aberrations affect the\ngene expression levels on a global -- in a"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"global sense."},"396":{"dur":11,"text":"So, having had these tools, we then tried\nto understand the dynamics of changes in the"},"407":{"dur":4,"text":"transition from normal epithelium to invasive\ndisease."},"412":{"dur":4,"text":"And initially, we turned two model systems,\nwhich is cervical carcinogenesis, colorectal"},"416":{"dur":6,"text":"carcinogenesis, mainly for the reason because\nthe morphological changes are very well described"},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"and they are accessible."},"425":{"dur":6,"text":"So, we -- you know the sequence, it goes from\nlow grade dysplasia to high grade dysplasia"},"431":{"dur":4,"text":"and eventually to invasive disease, and while\nit looks a little different in the colon,"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"it's the same."},"436":{"dur":5,"text":"You have premalignant lesions that, if they\nwould be removed, you would treat -- you would"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"cure the patients."},"445":{"dur":6,"text":"So, we asked -- we used a combination of molecular\ncytogenetic tissue microdissection techniques,"},"451":{"dur":7,"text":"gene expression profiling, and asked the question,\n\"Is there a non-random distribution of non-chromosomal"},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"changes in any one of those different tumor\nentities?"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"Is there a stage-specific sequence of events?"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"In other words, are some changes early, others\nlate?"},"470":{"dur":5,"text":"And which additional genetic or epigenetic\nchanges do occur?\""},"475":{"dur":7,"text":"And it is now completely clear that the distribution\nof chromosomal gains and losses is non-random."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"In red you see the aberration of the cervix."},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's just look at chromosome 3."},"488":{"dur":5,"text":"On the right side are the gains; on the left\nside are the losses."},"493":{"dur":4,"text":"Chromosome 5 has gained, but the rest of the\ngenome is relatively unaffected."},"497":{"dur":5,"text":"In the colon, which is displayed in green,\nyou can see, invariably, the gains of chromosome"},"503":{"dur":6,"text":"7, extra copies of the long arm of chromosome\n8, chromosome 20, and very specific and unique"},"509":{"dur":5,"text":"for colorectal carcinogenesis, gains of chromosome\n13."},"515":{"dur":7,"text":"And I just wanted to point out, we and others\nhave studied more than 500 cases of cervical"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"carcinomas."},"523":{"dur":6,"text":"Here the blood is normalized for 10, and you\ncan appreciate that all cervical carcinomas"},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"have extra copies of the long arm of chromosome\n3."},"533":{"dur":6,"text":"In other words, this aberration is as common\nas is the [unintelligible] chromosome in CML."},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"We do know that we have risk factors."},"543":{"dur":7,"text":"Of course, high-risk HPV, most commonly 16\nand 18, which is required for cervical cancer"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"to occur but it's not sufficient."},"554":{"dur":8,"text":"And in colorectal tumors, you know that inflammation,\nulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease greatly"},"563":{"dur":6,"text":"increases the risk for colorectal tumors to\noccur, but the distribution in these conditions"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"is the same as in sporadic tumors."},"573":{"dur":9,"text":"Conclusion: We do not have a cytogenetic chaos\nbut we have a stability on a different plateau"},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"of copy number changes."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like a speciation."},"586":{"dur":7,"text":"So, but, we do have the problem that we have\nan enormous degree of variability."},"594":{"dur":9,"text":"So, the question comes up, how can we reconcile\naneuploidy, an ongoing chromosomal instability,"},"604":{"dur":7,"text":"which is a fact, with a strictly conserved\npattern of genomic imbalances that we observe?"},"611":{"dur":5,"text":"And in order to answer this question, we engaged\nin a collaboration with Navy, at that time,"},"616":{"dur":9,"text":"across the street, it was two streets from\nhere, and collected patient samples where"},"626":{"dur":6,"text":"have ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive\nductal carcinoma on the same slide."},"632":{"dur":5,"text":"And from that we used tissue microdissection\nand we prepared from both of these lesions"},"638":{"dur":5,"text":"independent slides where we had the single\ncell suspension here, you see, and for one"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"case, the histology."},"647":{"dur":6,"text":"And then we chose -- we looked at the distribution\nof genomic imbalance that is specific for"},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"breast cancer; you can, again, appreciate\nthat it's specific, but it's different from"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"both colon and cervix."},"660":{"dur":5,"text":"And we chose probes, fish probes, fluorescent\nin situ hybridization to enumerate the copy"},"666":{"dur":6,"text":"number of these regions together with control\nprobes directly on these cells that were prepared"},"672":{"dur":7,"text":"with DCIS and IDC, and that was done -- this\nis a technical detail -- in repeat hybridization,"},"679":{"dur":7,"text":"but at the end of the day, we could enumerate\n10 independent loci on many of these cells"},"687":{"dur":5,"text":"that were on the slide and were prepared from\nDCIS and synchronous IDC."},"693":{"dur":7,"text":"And we don't have to go through in detail\nbut that allowed us to enumerate in the entire"},"700":{"dur":6,"text":"population of the cancer copy number gains\nfor a certain chromosome and copy number losses"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"for a certain chromosome."},"708":{"dur":5,"text":"And here you can see there are many cells\nthat have the same pattern, and this is the"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"DCIS and this is the synchronous IDC."},"717":{"dur":6,"text":"You can appreciate that here was have a major\npattern that is recapitulated in the invasive"},"723":{"dur":7,"text":"component, but you can also appreciate that\nwe have an enormous degree of heterogeneity."},"731":{"dur":9,"text":"In some instances, the clone that was predominant\nin the DCIS actually disappeared in the IDC."},"740":{"dur":5,"text":"And together with our colleagues from NCBI\nand in collaboration -- a very fruitful and"},"745":{"dur":6,"text":"pleasant collaboration with Russell Schwartz,\nCarnegie Mellon -- we could then reconstruct"},"752":{"dur":6,"text":"the dynamics that occurred from the transition\nfrom DCIS to invasive disease."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"And two pathways occurred."},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"One was clone stability."},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"Here you can see the DCIS on the left and\nthe IDC on the right."},"768":{"dur":6,"text":"You can see the major clone, which is defined\nby this copy number oration, prevailed; it"},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"was also found in this component."},"777":{"dur":4,"text":"And here as well, and in this case, it was\nthe same."},"781":{"dur":7,"text":"But much to our surprise, we also noted that\nin some cases the entire population of clones"},"788":{"dur":6,"text":"that were present in pre-invasive disease\ndisappeared."},"794":{"dur":6,"text":"Only those that acquired extra copy of the\nMYC oncogene made it to invasive disease,"},"801":{"dur":8,"text":"and that, again, told us that the transition\nfrom pre-invasive disease in many cases is"},"810":{"dur":5,"text":"determined by the acquisition of extra copies\nof the cMYC oncogene."},"815":{"dur":7,"text":"But, you can also appreciate that in many\ncases that ductal carcinoma in situ already"},"822":{"dur":9,"text":"governed by an enormous degree of chromosomal\ninstability, therefore, in a -- I'm not a"},"832":{"dur":7,"text":"clinician, but I just can't see that any other\nintervention then surgery would remove these"},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"clones."},"840":{"dur":7,"text":"But, anyway, despite this chromosomal instability,\nif we then look at all these clones that we"},"848":{"dur":8,"text":"have analyzed in copy number changes, we can\nconclude that chromosome 1Q, which is frequently"},"857":{"dur":6,"text":"gained, is very rarely lost, and chromosome\n8Q, MYC oncogene, which is frequently gained,"},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"is very rarely lost."},"865":{"dur":6,"text":"And those chromosomes, here P53 for instance,\nwhich is frequently lost, is rarely gained,"},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"despite this enormous degree of chromosomal\ninstability."},"875":{"dur":7,"text":"And this makes it then consistent with the\ngenomic imbalances that are specific for copy"},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"number changes."},"883":{"dur":7,"text":"So, despite chromosomal instability, what\nis the pressure for the [unintelligible] selection"},"891":{"dur":5,"text":"is the maintenance of the genomic copy number\nchanges that are the defining features for"},"897":{"dur":3,"text":"any one of those carcinomas."},"900":{"dur":7,"text":"This now, of course, [unintelligible] regressions,\nwe have changes, mostly whole chromosome arms,"},"907":{"dur":6,"text":"or, in other instances, whole chromosomes\nin the colon, gain of entire chromosome 7."},"913":{"dur":7,"text":"This now brings us, I think, a fundamental\nquestion: how does it affect the transcriptome?"},"920":{"dur":4,"text":"You could ask the question, you could test\nthe hypothesis."},"925":{"dur":4,"text":"The expression of all or most genes located\non a chromosome is affected by chromosomal"},"929":{"dur":2,"text":"gain or loss."},"931":{"dur":5,"text":"Or, the expression of only a few genes whose\nreduced or increased expression is critical"},"936":{"dur":5,"text":"for tumor genesis is the target of chromosomal\naneuploidy during tumor genesis, and this"},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"was not clear."},"944":{"dur":7,"text":"And in order to identify -- so, the conclusion\nso far: chromosomal aneuploidies are a defining"},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"feature of carcinomas."},"954":{"dur":6,"text":"The distribution of genomic imbalances is\ncancer-specific to an extent that you don't"},"960":{"dur":4,"text":"have to have any other information, but the\ndistribution of genomic imbalances to say"},"965":{"dur":4,"text":"it's a cervical carcinoma or a colorectal\ncarcinoma."},"969":{"dur":6,"text":"Specific genomic imbalances occur before the\ntransition to invasive disease, which is very"},"975":{"dur":4,"text":"important if you want to convert that to a\ndiagnostic test, which I will show you later."},"980":{"dur":7,"text":"And, as I said before, there is no cytogenetic\nchaos but a stability on a different plateau"},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"of genomic copy number changes."},"989":{"dur":8,"text":"So, as I said, we then asked, what are the\nconsequences of chromosomal aneuploidy of"},"998":{"dur":4,"text":"the transcriptome?\" which I will discuss briefly\nin the next few slides, and then I will turn"},"1003":{"dur":6,"text":"to how we can use this knowledge to improve\nthe diagnosis of cancer and pre-malignant"},"1010":{"dur":1,"text":"lesions."},"1011":{"dur":4,"text":"So, in order to address the question, what\nare the consequences on the transcriptome,"},"1015":{"dur":8,"text":"we use an old technique which is called microcell-mediated\nchromosome transfer to generate artificial"},"1023":{"dur":2,"text":"chromosomal trisomies, and this is how it\nlooks."},"1026":{"dur":5,"text":"Here we have a normal karyotype, and when\nwe do this manipulation, we can put on -- put"},"1031":{"dur":3,"text":"in an extra chromosome, in that case, chromosome\n3."},"1035":{"dur":3,"text":"But you can see -- which is present in three\ncopies."},"1039":{"dur":3,"text":"But you can see that the rest of the karyotype\nis unaffected."},"1043":{"dur":6,"text":"Then we collected RNA from the control and\nRNA from the plus-3 cell and performed global"},"1049":{"dur":1,"text":"gene expression profiling."},"1050":{"dur":5,"text":"Here, again, the control, some genes up, some\ngenes are down, which is what you would expect."},"1056":{"dur":9,"text":"But, if you look at the plus-3, you can appreciate\nthat most, if not all, genes go up in expression"},"1066":{"dur":1,"text":"levels."},"1067":{"dur":5,"text":"And this, by the way, is a sign if you look\nat the constitutional chromosomal trisomies"},"1072":{"dur":10,"text":"-- 13, 18, 21 -- where this increase is also\nnot restricted to a few genes but affects"},"1082":{"dur":1,"text":"most of the genes."},"1084":{"dur":5,"text":"And interestingly, on a site, it's tolerated\nfor chromosome 13, 18, 21 because these are"},"1090":{"dur":4,"text":"the gene-poorest chromosomes, despite they\nhave larger size."},"1094":{"dur":4,"text":"Thirteen, of course, it's larger than chromosome\n20."},"1099":{"dur":5,"text":"So, aneuploidy results in a significant increase\nof average message levels of genes on the"},"1105":{"dur":2,"text":"affected chromosomes."},"1107":{"dur":5,"text":"The degree of increase closely follows genomic\ncopy number, therefore, chromosomal aneuploidies"},"1112":{"dur":6,"text":"not only target a few specific genes but results\nin a massive and complex deregulation of the"},"1119":{"dur":1,"text":"cancer transcriptome."},"1120":{"dur":6,"text":"And just contrast that to what we see as a\nconsequence of the [unintelligible] chromosome"},"1126":{"dur":6,"text":"where you have one aberration, now you have\na thousand genes that go up, and you also"},"1133":{"dur":5,"text":"have to appreciate, of course, there are numerous\ntranscription factors, with then, in turn,"},"1138":{"dur":5,"text":"affect genes and other chromosome, so it's\nreally a massive deregulation which we have"},"1144":{"dur":4,"text":"not understood in its complexity."},"1148":{"dur":4,"text":"This is not only the case in our model system\nbut also in real tumors."},"1153":{"dur":5,"text":"Here, a control, a normal DNA copy number,\nand this is the gene expression level, which"},"1158":{"dur":6,"text":"is normal as well, but if you have copy number\ndecreases or copy number increases, the gene"},"1164":{"dur":3,"text":"expression goes down in this region, goes\nup in these regions."},"1168":{"dur":4,"text":"It's completely clear: function follows form."},"1173":{"dur":5,"text":"And this is established not only from our\nlaboratory but now accepted in the scientific"},"1179":{"dur":3,"text":"community."},"1182":{"dur":4,"text":"To summarize, we have a normal cell, karyotypically\nstable."},"1187":{"dur":4,"text":"Then, we have chronic inflammation, for instance,\nin the colon, HPV infection."},"1192":{"dur":5,"text":"We have, for whatever reason, a depressed\nhyperproliferation, or have just a cell cycle"},"1197":{"dur":1,"text":"accident."},"1199":{"dur":7,"text":"What happens then that we have extra copies\nof a given chromosome, and this chromosome"},"1207":{"dur":4,"text":"is tissue-specific; that can occur with or\nwithout additional mutation."},"1212":{"dur":5,"text":"They're what call nuclear aneuploidies, very\nlow so there is not much difference in the"},"1217":{"dur":2,"text":"DNA content from one cell to another."},"1220":{"dur":5,"text":"The trisomies affect global gene expression\nlevels, and as you will see later, these events"},"1226":{"dur":4,"text":"are the basis for global expansion of these\nearly lesions."},"1230":{"dur":4,"text":"If this is not being treated, then we arrive\nat a cancer cell where we have additional"},"1235":{"dur":5,"text":"mutations -- as we know, P53 occurs relatively\nlate in colorectal tumor genesis."},"1240":{"dur":5,"text":"We have an enormous degree of the variability\nin the

you"},"1253":{"dur":1,"text":"before."},"1254":{"dur":5,"text":"What is the selective pressure is the maintenance\nof the specific genomic imbalances."},"1260":{"dur":8,"text":"So, now I -- after this

all."},"1274":{"dur":6,"text":"First, I will discuss with you the role of\ngenomic instability in the prognosis of breast"},"1280":{"dur":5,"text":"cancer, then we look at cervical carcinoma,\nand, if
