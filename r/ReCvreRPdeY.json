way through:"},"64":{"dur":6,"text":"I want you to ask, when will we decide\nto eliminate chronic disease?"},"71":{"dur":4,"text":"The reason we can ask that question now\nis because we know what

make\na big difference to do something about it."},"86":{"dur":1,"text":"So first the good feelings."},"88":{"dur":3,"text":"Here's the good feelings:\nif you look at the last century,"},"91":{"dur":4,"text":"you'll notice that in 1900,\nwe had a life expectancy of 50."},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"And now, at the end of the century,"},"98":{"dur":3,"text":"actually in 2010,\nwhen we calculated it again,"},"102":{"dur":2,"text":"our life expectancy was now 80."},"104":{"dur":1,"text":"Can you believe it?"},"106":{"dur":4,"text":"Our life expectancy increased\nby 30 years over one century of time."},"111":{"dur":1,"text":"There's another interesting fact,"},"113":{"dur":5,"text":"and that's chronic diseases\nlike heart disease, stroke, and cancer,"},"119":{"dur":4,"text":"those diseases have been killing\nfewer people every year."},"124":{"dur":4,"text":"So we should start feeling good\nthat we're going to be healthier."},"129":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you look at these two facts,\nwhat you're going to think is,"},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"\"I can sit back and relax\nbecause isn't it nice"},"135":{"dur":4,"text":"we as a human race, and we as Americans,\nare getting healthier?\""},"140":{"dur":3,"text":"Now if you think that,\nyou would be dead wrong."},"144":{"dur":6,"text":"And the reason is that our health\nhas been declining over the last 25 years."},"151":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, why is that true?"},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"We have some evidence for that\nand some of it you've read in the paper."},"157":{"dur":4,"text":"For example, more people\nare becoming obese,"},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"more people are acquiring diabetes,"},"166":{"dur":3,"text":"more people have\nuncontrolled blood pressure,"},"169":{"dur":4,"text":"and all of these three things\nare the foundation for heart disease."},"174":{"dur":4,"text":"Now the interesting part of it is,\nwe don't see it in our statistics yet"},"179":{"dur":3,"text":"because it is predominantly\naffecting younger people"},"182":{"dur":4,"text":"and they haven't died yet to show us\nthat there has been a change."},"187":{"dur":4,"text":"So what you have to realize\nis that we are in a new predicament"},"192":{"dur":4,"text":"of being able to predict\nwhat's going to happen in our future."},"196":{"dur":4,"text":"And here's one other thing I need to say\nthat you might not have thought of before:"},"200":{"dur":4,"text":"That is that our children\nare the first generation"},"206":{"dur":5,"text":"that represents three generations\nof eating processed food."},"213":{"dur":4,"text":"And because of that, we now have\na really big job on our hands"},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"to understand what that has done\nto the human race"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"over the last three generations."},"224":{"dur":4,"text":"In this slide, you can see the first line\nis the one I already showed you,"},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"that's 100 years of increase"},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"that's perfectly linear\nover that period of time."},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"And if we did everything right,"},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"we should be able to gain another 30 years\nin the next century, right?"},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what we'd like to do."},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"But, in fact,"},"245":{"dur":5,"text":"medical scientists now tell us that\nbecause of diabetes and because of obesity"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"that are happening in our young people,"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"that they are going to be\nthe first generation"},"255":{"dur":3,"text":"ever in the United States to live\nshorter lives than their parents."},"260":{"dur":4,"text":"So what that means is that we are now \non the trajectory that's going down."},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"And we don't even know it."},"267":{"dur":4,"text":"We know it because we who study disease\ncan predict what's going to happen"},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"to the people who have these diseases."},"274":{"dur":1,"text":"Are you feeling better?"},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"Just checking your pulse."},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so what we need to do is find a way"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"to take that downward arrow,\nand put it on the up."},"285":{"dur":5,"text":"And if we can do that, we should be able\nto face a century of increased health,"},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"and increased longevity."},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"Now I have to talk\nabout my friend, David Barker."},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"David Barker is a brilliant Englishman,"},"300":{"dur":3,"text":"who came to Portland\nto work with us over a decade ago."},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"He died a year ago, last August."},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"And 25 years ago, he started\nthe whole movement"},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"for us to understand\nhow chronic disease works."},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"So what he showed was this curve,"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"and if you forget\neverything else I say today,"},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"take this curve home in your mind\nbecause it tells the whole story."},"322":{"dur":5,"text":"What he showed was that if you're born\nat the low end of the birth-weight scale -"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"this has been done\nin seven countries now -"},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"if you're at the five-pound end\nof the birth-weight scale on the average,"},"334":{"dur":4,"text":"you have a three to five times higher risk\nof dying of heart disease"},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"than if you were born\nat the eight to nine-pound range."},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"And furthermore,\nif you are on the upscale,"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"at the very high end of that scale,"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"say, above nine or ten pounds,"},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"your risk goes up like the babies\nthat were born small."},"359":{"dur":4,"text":"So, all of the sudden, we have\na really new profound thing to say"},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"about chronic disease\nthat we never knew before."},"368":{"dur":5,"text":"And what that is, is that how you grow\nbefore you're born matters."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's not just how [you grow]\nbefore you're born,"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"it's also in the first\ntwo years of your life."},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"So the nutrition,\nand the conditions you lived in,"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"in your very earliest moments of life"},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"determine whether or not"},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to have\na high risk for disease later on."},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"And how does this work?"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"I need to tell you a little about it"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"so that you can believe something\nabout how this works"},"399":{"dur":4,"text":"What it means is that the babies born\nat the low end of the scale"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"are small for two reasons."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"One: they didn't get enough nutrition\nfrom their mothers."},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"That can be for lots of reasons."},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"Her diet, for example,"},"411":{"dur":5,"text":"or her placenta that she tried to make\nto give nutrients to the baby didn't work."},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"Those babies are very different,"},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"and they are vulnerable\nfor the rest of their life."},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"Why are they vulnerable?"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"Because they have fewer heart cells,"},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"they have fewer\nfiltering units in their kidney,"},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"and they also have one other problem\nand that is that their pancreas,"},"432":{"dur":4,"text":"that makes insulin,\nhas fewer insulin-making cells."},"436":{"dur":4,"text":"And because of that, they're vulnerable\nfor disease as they get older."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"Now what about the babies at the high end?"},"443":{"dur":4,"text":"The babies at the high end are vulnerable\nbecause they got too much nutrition"},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"and that's almost always because\ntheir mothers had poor glucose control,"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"their blood sugars were high,\nthat sugar went across the placenta,"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"and the baby saw it as energy,\nand deposited it as fat."},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"So those babies have a lot of fat,"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"and I just want to tell you the most\ninteresting thing we've discovered:"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"The babies at the small end\nand the babies at the large end"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"have almost the same risks."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"And the interesting part about those risks"},"473":{"dur":4,"text":"is they cause an inflammatory reaction\nthat's very low-grade,"},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"and they make those people vulnerable\nfor the rest of their lives."},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"Now if you're feeling bad about that,"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm just going to try\nto make you feel worse."},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reason I am going to\nmake you feel worse"},"490":{"dur":4,"text":"is because it turns out that those cases,"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"the small babies and the large babies,"},"497":{"dur":4,"text":"can pass that effect on to their babies\nin the next generation."},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"First of all, I have to tell you\na story about me."},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm trying to get you convinced\nof this, so here it is."},"513":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm in my late 60s,\nnot many months left, actually."},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"It turns out that the egg that made me"},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"was made in my mother -\nshe is 90-some years old,"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"still alive -"},"530":{"dur":4,"text":"it was made in her ovary\nwhen she was in my grandmother's womb."},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you get that?"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"The egg that made me\nwas made in my mother's ovary,"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"when she was a fetus in my grandmother."},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"That means that the egg that made me\nwas nourished by my grandmother."},"547":{"dur":6,"text":"That nourishment changed the way\nmy risks for life will be."},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"I was also nourished by my mother,"},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"so there's a two-generation effect\non the nourishment."},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to tell you about this picture:"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"This picture was taken in 1931,\nand if you look at the woman on the right,"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"she's a handsome woman,\nshe's 86 years old,"},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"and when she was a baby,\nshe was being held by her mother in 1931."},"574":{"dur":6,"text":"It turns out that the egg that made her\nwas made in her mother's womb"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"when her mother was in\nher grandmother's womb,"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"who was born in 1897."},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"There's one other\ninteresting fact about this:"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"If you look at the lady on the left,"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"she was born to the woman\nsitting down in front."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"Now that lady doesn't look too happy."},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't actually know what her issue is,"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"606":{"dur":5,"text":"but I think part of it is she was born\nbefore the civil war, right?"},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"Times were tough."},"614":{"dur":5,"text":"So it turns out that I,"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"who am now in my late 60s,"},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"the egg made me was made\nin my mother almost 100 years ago."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"So that means in egg years, I'm 100."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"637":{"dur":6,"text":"And this lady, that I am showing you here\non the right, in egg years, she's 110."},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"We call this \"The 100-Year Effect.\""},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"The 100-year effect means\nthat nutrition flows across generations"},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"from one person to the next,\nthrough mothers,"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"each successive generation."},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"And this nutritional flow means\nthat you have to have good nutrition"},"661":{"dur":5,"text":"every single generation in order to keep\nfrom having a risk for chronic disease."},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"So it turns out that it's a more\ncomplicated story than you might think."},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"That's because the nutrition that a woman\ngives her baby when she's pregnant,"},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"not only comes from the food\nshe eats, her diet,"},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"but it also comes from the body\nwhich she was made as a child,"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"and as she was growing up."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's a man's story here too."},"691":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's because men also influence\nthe health of their babies,"},"695":{"dur":5,"text":"and both men and women do this\nthrough an effect we call \"epigenetics.\""},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"Now if you don't know\nthis word, learn it right now:"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"Epigenetics."},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"Learn it, say it,\nand use it on your friends."},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"It'll wear out in a few generations,\nbut right now it's hot."},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"So here's the word."},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"Epigenetics means this:"},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"The genetic code you got\nfrom your mother and your father"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"determines many things about you."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"Those genes you got\nare expressed all the time,"},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"and they're made of a DNA code,\nthat you learned in biology."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"The truth is, you can't change that code."},"737":{"dur":5,"text":"That code is found in every chromosome\nin your body, in every cell."},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"And that doesn't change."},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"However, what you might not know,\nis epigenetics, and what that means"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"is that before you're born, those genes,\nsome of them, not all of them,"},"752":{"dur":5,"text":"some of them are very sensitive to stress\nfrom the mother and diet from the mother,"},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"and you can alter those genes\nthat will change the way"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to grow\nfor the rest of your life."},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can't blame women"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"for the bad health of everybody."},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"And you shouldn't try."},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"Why?"},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"Because both men and women,\nin this country now,"},"780":{"dur":4,"text":"eat the worst diets\nof any Western country in the world."},"785":{"dur":5,"text":"We eat fast foods and we've been trained\nby industry to love the food they feed us."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"And many of us\nhave trouble getting off of it."},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"So don't blame women for this;\nblame our food culture,"},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"because our food culture is doing us in."},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"So what will happen if we don't change?"},"803":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, in 1960, one person\nout of every 100 was diabetic."},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"In 1995, one person\nout of 50 was diabetic."},"813":{"dur":4,"text":"Today, in 2015, one person\nout of eight is diabetic."},"817":{"dur":5,"text":"And it's predicted that by 2050,\none person out of three will be diabetic."},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"Why do we care about this epidemic?"},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"There's one reason:"},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"We not only care for those people\nwho are going to suffer the illness,"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"but we are also going to\nhave to pay for it"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"because 70 percent of people\nwho get diabetes"},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"will also acquire heart disease."},"839":{"dur":5,"text":"And heart disease is terrible\nand expensive, and by 2026,"},"844":{"dur":5,"text":"we estimate the financial burden\nto be $650 billion a year,"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"and by the way,\nit's $1 billion a day right now,"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"and then it'll be $2 billion a day."},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"We can't afford this."},"858":{"dur":1,"text":"And because we're becoming diabetic,"},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's the younger people\nwho are doing it,"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"we're going to pay this bill\nin our future."},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"So, what is a good diet?"},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"A good diet, you don't have to read\na fad-ish book to get it."},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"All you have to know is to eat\nfruits and vegetables, beans,"},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"nuts, and whole grains."},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you eat those most meals,\nevery day, you'll be eating a good diet."},"879":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're a pregnant woman,"},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"I recommend you throw fish in\ntwo or three times a week,"},"883":{"dur":4,"text":"because the development of a baby's brain\nneeds the oils that you get from fish."},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"Otherwise, it's a simple prospect."},"891":{"dur":4,"text":"So how are we going to get better?\nAnd what are we going to do about this?"},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"Because we are in an epidemic."},"898":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course, the answer is you,\nand the answer is me."},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"We have to work together,\nand how can we do that?"},"906":{"dur":5,"text":"We can do that because we can influence\nour family, our schools,"},"912":{"dur":2,"text":"and the policies that we make."},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me just suggest one thing for you:"},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"If you care about yourself\nand your family,"},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"go home and find out how many\nprocessed foods you are eating."},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, those ones\nwith the labels all on them."},"929":{"dur":2,"text":"And gradually find foods\nthat are actually healthy,"},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"and replace all those, and stop buying\nthose foods with all those labels."},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause) (Cheers)"},"945":{"dur":2,"text":"The next thing is make sure\nthat the kids that we love"},"948":{"dur":2,"text":"go to school and have healthy meals."},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause)"},"956":{"dur":2,"text":"Influence the workplace where you work,"},"958":{"dur":2,"text":"and make sure that healthy foods\nare always available,"},"961":{"dur":3,"text":"and lastly, don't forget\nto talk to your legislators:"},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"We need policies to stop what's happening,\nand poisoning our bodies."},"969":{"dur":3,"text":"(Applause) (Cheers)"},"977":{"dur":3,"text":"When will we decide\nto eliminate chronic disease?"},"981":{"dur":1,"text":"Today."},"982":{"dur":3,"text":"When we realize that our society\ntoday is providing"},"985":{"dur":4,"text":"the nourishment for children,\nand our grandchildren of tomorrow,"},"990":{"dur":3,"text":"and if all of us work together,\nwe can better the future."},"994":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"995":{"dur":1,"text":"(Applause)"}}
