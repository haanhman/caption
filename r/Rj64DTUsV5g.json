just publish\nit then."},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't wanna write something else.\u201d"},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I figured I was sitting with Craig\none night, we were talking about all of it,"},"874":{"dur":4,"text":"like the possibility of publishing it, and\nit was like why wouldn\u2019t I?"},"879":{"dur":3,"text":"Ok, what would be the main reason not to tell\nthis

ones."},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"But the bottom line was that I was ashamed."},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"Like I was in this marriage and whatever the\nstories we tell ourselves."},"895":{"dur":5,"text":"Like I wasn\u2019t enough and he\u2026 and I\u2019m\na fraud and my family\u2019s a fraud."},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, all the stories I was telling and it\nall comes down to shame."},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"And, Marie, for me, the only thing that I\nknow as a recovering addict is that shame"},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"is the kiss of

deal?"},"936":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, it\u2019s nothing."},"937":{"dur":1,"text":"And then everybody goes, \u201cMe too, me too,\u201d\nand it goes away."},"938":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"939":{"dur":4,"text":"So really the question for me and for Craig\nwas like is shame true or is it not?"},"943":{"dur":2,"text":"Because there\u2019s no\u2026 that\u2019s a yes or\nno question."},"945":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"It\u2019s not like no there\u2019s no shame, but\nfor you because you\u2019re an alcoholic,

about your philosophy\nof sistering?"},"1617":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"1618":{"dur":6,"text":"So it\u2019s this idea that life gets hard sometimes,\ngets really heavy, and what do we do

a corner."},"1642":{"dur":6,"text":"And so what sometimes what happens is that\nthere\u2019s too heavy of a load on top of the"},"1648":{"dur":1,"text":"joist and so it starts to weaken."},"1650":{"dur":4,"text":"And so when the joist starts to weaken the\ncarpenters bring another board to the left"},"1655":{"dur":1,"text":"of the joist to shore it

it\u2019s so solid with a board to the\nleft and the board to the right that it can"},"1665":{"dur":1,"text":"handle any kind of load."},"1667":{"dur":8,"text":"And so that process is called

even."},"1678":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, we think... like sometimes life just\ngets too heavy."},"1681":{"dur":5,"text":"Like the load on us gets too\u2026 and the mistake\nwe make is to think it\u2019s a mistake."},"1686":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"1687":{"dur":2,"text":"We think, \u201cOh my God, I did something wrong.\u201d"},"1690":{"dur":4,"text":"But I think life gets too heavy and too

it\u2019s needing people and being needed."},"1708":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"1709":{"dur":4,"text":"Right, so I just want my whole life to just\nbe a dance between being sistered and

what if I rushed towards the pain of\nthe world instead of turning away from it?"},"1782":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"1783":{"dur":5,"text":"Like, what if heartbreak, what breaks my heart,\nis actually not something to be numbed or"},"1789":{"dur":2,"text":"avoided or be silent about either?"},"1791":{"dur":3,"text":"What if what breaks my heart is a message\nto me?"},"1795":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, is a wake up?"},"1797":{"dur":4,"text":"Is like a shining arrow that is pointing me\ndirectly towards my purpose?"},"1801":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"1802":{"dur":1,"text":"Because that\u2019s what we\u2019re freaking here\nto do."},"1803":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes."},"1804":{"dur":1,"text":"That\u2019s it is to, like, heal ourselves and\nheal the world."},"1806":{"dur":3,"text":"And you don't heal
