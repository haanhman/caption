that"},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"name."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"That's right."},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"But what's interesting about\nthat is not only the story"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"itself but also the\nfact that there were,"},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, hundreds of\nGerman prisoners of war who were"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"interned in Memphis and\nin the surrounding

came."},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the trick in writing\nsomething like this is not only"},"414":{"dur":5,"text":"to tell that individual story\nbut also to try to put it in"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"some kind of context."},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"And so within a very short.."},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean the\nentries are, you know,"},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"maximum of
