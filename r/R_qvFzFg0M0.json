(Lynette) I just"},"504.00":{"start":"504","dur":"4","text":"find that it happens with the flow, (Graeme) Okay. (Lynette) cause what happens is"},"508.00":{"start":"508","dur":"4","text":"acrylics have a tendency to tip dry, and I just find with"},"512.00":{"start":"512","dur":"4","text":"that little bit of airbrush Extender it&#39;s not going to tip dry as much.

So as you can see I can come in and do some"},"540.00":{"start":"540","dur":"4","text":"really nice sharp lines, and then the rest of it I can sort of just"},"544.00":{"start":"544","dur":"4","text":"bring the airbrush back off the canvas and I just"},"548.00":{"start":"548","dur":"4","text":"hazes in. (Graeme) The viewers mightn&#39;t understand that the reason you"},"552.00":{"start":"552","dur":"4","text":"keep spraying it on your hand is to check for moisture.

(Graeme) And you can see the effects"},"596.00":{"start":"596","dur":"4","text":"that you can get, and it&#39;s pretty well drying as soon as it hits the"},"600.00":{"start":"600","dur":"4","text":"canvas.
