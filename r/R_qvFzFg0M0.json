Well we're down in Victoria, at a beautiful town called"},"68":{"dur":4,"text":"Healesville, and I'm with a very talented lady, Lynette Orzlowski."},"72":{"dur":4,"text":"(Lynette) Thanks Graeme. (Graeme) How are you Darling? (Lynette)  Good. How are you?  (Graeme) Great to be here. Now Lynette is"},"76":{"dur":4,"text":"an award winning, multi award winning artist, she's won over one hundred awards"},"80":{"dur":4,"text":"which is amazing, and also a multi disciplined artist as"},"84":{"dur":4,"text":"well. Lynette is disciplined with pastels, with oils"},"88":{"dur":4,"text":"with acrylics. And today - which is really cool because we haven't had this on before"},"92":{"dur":4,"text":"she's also an airbrush artist, and she's going to take us through a bunch of things with airbrush"},"96":{"dur":4,"text":"today which is fascinating. And when you see the quality of her work you'll perfectly"},"100":{"dur":4,"text":"understand what I'm talking about. I mean she uses a number of different ideas to put"},"104":{"dur":4,"text":"into her work. Loves animals and you've really been working on horses"},"108":{"dur":4,"text":"for a long time. So tell me how the airbrushing and the horses actually came about? How does that fit together"},"112":{"dur":4,"text":"for you? (Lynette) Well I've been airbrushing for about sixteen, seventeen years"},"116":{"dur":4,"text":"now. (Graeme) Okay. (Lynette) And the horses were something that I had in"},"120":{"dur":4,"text":"my younger life. I use to ride horses, use to"},"124":{"dur":4,"text":"have horses, and now it's sort of transferred into my daughter riding"},"128":{"dur":4,"text":"horses  - and she Events. So I get to go out there with camera and"},"132":{"dur":4,"text":"take a lot of shots. And literally the airbrush is a tool that I've"},"136":{"dur":4,"text":"used for quiet a few years, and now I'm just putting it into practice on"},"140":{"dur":4,"text":"the canvas. (Graeme) That's fantastic. And obviously there's a lot of studs"},"144":{"dur":4,"text":"in the area. (Lynette) There are, yeah there are. They're all"},"148":{"dur":4,"text":"diversified as well so you know, you've got racehorses, you've got Friesian's,"},"152":{"dur":4,"text":"you've got Quarter Horses, you've got Thoroughbreds, you've got pony"},"156":{"dur":4,"text":"clubbers all that sort of stuff, so lots of different horses. (Graeme) The difference with the airbrush"},"160":{"dur":4,"text":"is you can get a lot done but still, as easy as"},"164":{"dur":4,"text":"it looks, there's a lot that's involved in actually building it. And it's layers"},"168":{"dur":4,"text":"of airbrushing that you ave to build up, (Lynette) Yeah, absolutely. (Graeme) a little similar to normal painting"},"172":{"dur":4,"text":"but the fact is it's pretty well dry as soon as it hits the canvas isn't it?(Lynette) Yep, that's right."},"176":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) Yeah, so alright we're going to go through this, this is really interesting stuff. I mean I used to"},"180":{"dur":4,"text":"do this as a young man myself and I find it quite fascinating but come on the journey."},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"We are going to do some backgrounds initially which is similar to this one here."},"188":{"dur":4,"text":"(Lynette) Yep. (Graeme) And then Lynette is actually going to start to work on this particular piece right here as well, and it's"},"192":{"dur":4,"text":"going to be fantastic so come along for the ride."},"200":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) Okay"},"204":{"dur":4,"text":"Lynette, now you've got the blank canvas up there. Now one thing you did say to me just"},"208":{"dur":4,"text":"before we started was you use the best canvas. (Lynette) Yes I do. (Graeme) And what is"},"212":{"dur":4,"text":"that? (Lynette) It is from Art Spectrum, and it is the"},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"Claessens Belgian linen stretched canvas. (Graeme) You can't get any better can you? (Lynette) It's beautiful."},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) It's fantastic stuff so what you're going to do is, using the Golden acrylics"},"224":{"dur":4,"text":"(Lynette) Yes. (Graeme) and you're going to do - I don't know how you do what you're doing of course, but"},"228":{"dur":4,"text":"you're going to do that effect, the background effect for us. (Lynette) Yep, absolutely, so (Graeme) How do we start?"},"232":{"dur":4,"text":"(Lynette) what I do with my paintings is, I have a like a real"},"236":{"dur":4,"text":"wash effect. So this one I'm doing a little bit different to what"},"240":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm going to demonstrate later, but this is the same sort of style so it"},"244":{"dur":4,"text":"sort of going to be a bit old worldly sort of,"},"248":{"dur":4,"text":"sort of have a little bit of stencilling in it and stuff like that, so we'll go through that. (Graeme) Excellent."},"252":{"dur":4,"text":"(Lynette) So I'm just going to start with some Raw Umber, from Golden. Now there is a medium that you"},"256":{"dur":4,"text":"can put into it, and I do use a liquid glazing medium,"},"260":{"dur":4,"text":"but only a little bit cause it doesn't really need it actually."},"264":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) I love the fact that your table is your palette. (Lynette) Yes."},"268":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) It's great. (Lynette) Oh look, I've had palettes before that have just been a board."},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"With acrylic, because of the way they dry you can't just scrape them off. (Graeme) Yep."},"276":{"dur":4,"text":"(Lynette) So just using a little bit of water, (Graeme) Yep. (Lynette) now I did have the"},"280":{"dur":4,"text":"background painted, but I needed that dry so I can show you what I do in the"},"284":{"dur":4,"text":"second layer. (Graeme) Okay. Was it gesso you painted the background with? (Lynette) No, no, it's actually"},"288":{"dur":4,"text":"Golden Raw Umber with Titanium White. (Graeme) Okay. (Lynette) So"},"292":{"dur":4,"text":"it's the same sort of tonal that I've got"},"296":{"dur":4,"text":"the Raw Umber (Graeme) Yep. (Lynette) but just really lightened off. These Belgian linens are"},"300":{"dur":4,"text":"actually primed in acrylic. You can get them in oil as well, if you want to do oils,"},"304":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme)  Yep. (Lynette) but this is acrylic primed. (Graeme) Yes if you're"},"308":{"dur":4,"text":"going to do great work you may as well have the best. (Lynette) Yeah, exactly."},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) You've very much involved in the arts in the area. I mean to"},"316":{"dur":4,"text":"the extent that some of the memberships that you actually have are with:"},"320":{"dur":4,"text":"Illustrators Australia, the Wildlife Artist Society of Australasia, the Australia"},"324":{"dur":4,"text":"Gild of Realist Artist, Illustrators Australia, the Yarra Rangers Photographic"},"328":{"dur":4,"text":"Society, Institute of Equine Art Association."},"332":{"dur":4,"text":"Do you find that being a member of all those institutes"},"336":{"dur":4,"text":"helps you with your connections? (Lynette) It does, absolutely and I really, really"},"340":{"dur":4,"text":"enjoy when I actually get time to go to the meetings"},"344":{"dur":4,"text":"and you know, join their exhibitions and stuff like that. I"},"348":{"dur":4,"text":"do find with a busy life of painting and everything like that, it's very hard to get around"},"352":{"dur":4,"text":"around to them all. But yeah, I enjoy"},"356":{"dur":4,"text":"being with them all. They give you a little bit of information all the time"},"360":{"dur":4,"text":"so it's great. (Graeme) So this is a really loose"},"364":{"dur":4,"text":"mixture that you've got here. It's mostly water and then just sort of"},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"obviously got a big brush there as well - letting, letting the paint sort of"},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"do its own thing. (Lynette) Yeah, sometimes it needs extra layers, extra"},"376":{"dur":4,"text":"colours, there could be drying time in between, until you get"},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"the desired effect. (Graeme) Yep, so you've got a spray bottle there. (Lynette) I have a"},"384":{"dur":4,"text":"spray bottle just with water. (Graeme) Yep. (Lynette) I can actually use a spray"},"388":{"dur":4,"text":"bottle with metho in it if I wanted to, to breakup that paint. (Graeme) Aha."},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"(Lynette) It doesn't damage the paint it just separates it from the canvas. (Graeme) Yep. (Lynette) So"},"396":{"dur":4,"text":"this one I want it to be a little bit more Baroque style, sort of old world"},"400":{"dur":4,"text":"sort of something you would see on an old building. (Graeme) Yep, and that's just"},"404":{"dur":4,"text":"Golden acrylic white. (Lynette) Golden Acrylic Titanium White."},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) Okay. (Lynette) Absolutely, so I'm not actually watering this one down as much, so I'm getting"},"412":{"dur":4,"text":"a little bit more of a stronger effect. But then if I don't like it, then I can"},"416":{"dur":4,"text":"come back over with my squirt bottle and water it up again. (Graeme) Okay."},"420":{"dur":4,"text":"(Lynette) So I'm just going to squirt a bit more water just to make it run, just to break it up a little"},"424":{"dur":4,"text":"bit more. So that's it, (Graeme) A great looking background. (Lynette) we need to let that dry."},"428":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) Absolutely."},"444":{"dur":4,"text":"(Lynette) Once I've done the background and I've marked out my image, I"},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"then block in with white. So I'm just using the Golden High Flow"},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"acrylics, and it's especially formulated"},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"for you know, pen and ink, airbrush, anything like that so it's nice and thin."},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"So yeah, I use a mixture of that"},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"which I'm going to strain. (Graeme) And that's actually a strainer."},"468":{"dur":4,"text":"(Lynette) That's actually a automotive stainer yeah, so it's a real fine"},"472":{"dur":4,"text":"strainer. So any impurities or any"},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, extra sort of you know, lumps of pigment"},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"that are in the paint will actually be strainer out. The reason why"},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"I do this is cause the airbrush that I'm using which is a HPC"},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"Iwata airbrush. That's a point three eight needle. I don't change needles"},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"I use the same needle so I need it to be"},"496":{"dur":4,"text":"actually quite fine to go through. (Graeme) And what are you putting in there now? (Lynette) Okay, so what"},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm adding is a little bit of airbrush Transparent Extender. (Graeme) Yeah. (Lynette) I just"},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"find that it happens with the flow, (Graeme) Okay. (Lynette) cause what happens is"},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"acrylics have a tendency to tip dry, and I just find with"},"512":{"dur":4,"text":"that little bit of airbrush Extender it's not going to tip dry as much. (Graeme) Okay."},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"And you sort of get beading at the end of that little needle. (Lynette) More than beading it's actually just dry"},"520":{"dur":4,"text":"paint. (Graeme) Okay (Lynette) Yeah, so I'm going to start."},"524":{"dur":4,"text":"So just working off my reference here. (Graeme) Do you normally wear a mask at all?"},"528":{"dur":4,"text":"(Lynette) With automative - absolutely, (Graeme) Yep. (Lynette) and I normally do"},"532":{"dur":4,"text":"in the studio but because we're filming it would look really silly me to talk"},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"to you with a mask on. So as you can see I can come in and do some"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"really nice sharp lines, and then the rest of it I can sort of just"},"544":{"dur":4,"text":"bring the airbrush back off the canvas and I just"},"548":{"dur":4,"text":"hazes in. (Graeme) The viewers mightn't understand that the reason you"},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"keep spraying it on your hand is to check for moisture. (Lynette) It's not just that"},"556":{"dur":4,"text":"Graeme, it is  (Graeme) Yeah. (Lynette) and with moisture it will actually effect"},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"your painting and you won't be able to paint, (Graeme) Yeah. (Lynette) cause it will spirt out water"},"564":{"dur":4,"text":"onto your painting, especially using acrylics and water based"},"568":{"dur":4,"text":"it doesn't work.  But no, it's actually to"},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"clean the tip, because what happens is when you shut down"},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"your airbrush a little bit of paint sits on your needle, and a lot"},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"lot of people that have started airbrushing will find when they start their airbrush up on their"},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"page, they'll get splats of paint (Graeme) Okay. (Lynette) and at least this"},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"eliminates it. So what I'm doing is I'm cleaning that needle first, making"},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"sure there's no paint and it's ready to go. (Graeme) And you can see the effects"},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"that you can get, and it's pretty well drying as soon as it hits the"},"600":{"dur":4,"text":"canvas. (Lynette) Yeah, there's a little bit that you can rub"},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"off, but because yeah, it's been blown by the air"},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"it dries fairly quickly. (Graeme) Now"},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"these types of products I mean if anyone wanted to get these, particularly in this area, they'd"},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"be best of going down to Bayswater, to the Art Shop."},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"(Lynette) Absolutely, go and see NIck, Justin. (Graeme) Yep, see the guys down"},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"there because they've got a full range of all of these products."},"628":{"dur":4,"text":"Sort of a one stop shop for people in the Bayswater area. (Lynette) Yeah."},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"And look, you know, there's lots people that come from many different"},"636":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, areas, they do an online ordering system so"},"640":{"dur":4,"text":"even if you're in the other states they'll"},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"post out to you. (Graeme) I mean your horses are just amazing, there's one"},"648":{"dur":4,"text":"piece called Violet Rhapsody, and you're using these backgrounds. I mean the thing that I love"},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"about a lot of your work is that there's these wonderful negative spaces, and you've just"},"656":{"dur":4,"text":"got the animal sort of looming out of these various spots"},"660":{"dur":4,"text":"on the canvas. The majority of your work I mean you sell out"},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"before the damn things even get to the gallery which is fantastic for you and I"},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"can see why just by watching you work. But if people want commissioned work from you,"},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"they can just get in touch with you at your website, which is orzlowski dot"},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"com dot au. And if you want paintings of your horses done,"},"680":{"dur":4,"text":"I suggest you come in and say hello to her. (Lynette) So what I'm trying to create here is muscle"},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"tone. So yeah, you're seeing the white highlights."},"688":{"dur":4,"text":"Now sometimes things'll knock itself out with contrast,"},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"but with the other colors I'll bring contrast back in."},"696":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) Okay. (Lynette) So it can look a little bit flat sometimes"},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"but that's simply just a layer"},"704":{"dur":4,"text":"that I just haven't done yet. (Graeme) But the amazing part about this"},"708":{"dur":4,"text":"is you're creating all this with one color at the moment."},"712":{"dur":4,"text":"(Lynette) Yeah, yeah, actually a lot of people have said to me that I"},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"should leave it like a ghost figure, but I say the animals not dead so"},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"I won't do that yet. (Graeme) Yeah, so how long does one of those little pots"},"724":{"dur":4,"text":"normally last for. I mean it seems to be extended pretty well. (Lynette) Yeah,"},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"well this one here I'm only half way done, (Graeme) Wow. (Lynette) so I would be able to do the whole"},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"horse. (Graeme) Wow that's amazing (Lynette) Yeah, so you don't use a lot of paint and that's why"},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"there's not a lot of overspray, as you can tell it's not really"},"740":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, billowing clouds of smoke or anything like that you know,"},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"galvanised paint. So what I'm going to do, cause it's going to take"},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"about you know, another hour or so to do the white background,"},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"and because I want to show you guys how I actually create this, I'm"},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"going to change colors. (Graeme) Okay. (Lynette) Okay. (Graeme) Cool. (Lynette) I'm going to pop"},"760":{"dur":4,"text":"this up there."},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"(Lynette) Um"},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"cause he's a chestnut, I'm picking these lighter sort of"},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"colors. So just testing the airbrush (Graeme) Yep."},"780":{"dur":4,"text":"and just"},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"coloring in like a coloring book - in a way. (Graeme) Oh and the other"},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"tonal values are still popping through from the back. (Lynette) Because they're, they're almost"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"transparent. (Graeme) Yeah. (Lynette) Sill got a little bit of a"},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"opaque to it (Graeme) Yeah. (Lynette) but yeah, it's really picking up that um,"},"800":{"dur":4,"text":"those background colors so the places that I haven't"},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"airbrushed, and left the background color is going to come right through."},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"And always do reflective"},"812":{"dur":4,"text":"light into white."},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) And the beauty about the Golden paint all the colors are there, you actually don't have to mix the colors,"},"820":{"dur":4,"text":"they've got such a huge range. (Lynette) Yeah, absolutely. Not"},"824":{"dur":4,"text":"overly extensive in the High Flow, but definitely in the Heavy Body"},"828":{"dur":4,"text":"that I did the background with. (Graeme) Yep. (Lynette) Yeah, there is an extensive"},"832":{"dur":4,"text":"range of colors in that."},"836":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) The Anest Iwata - the cost of these guys is it expensive"},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"to have an airbrush? (Lynette) Something around this sort of caliber is"},"844":{"dur":4,"text":"around the three hundred and seventy, (Graeme) Okay. (Lynette) but you can actually have an entry level"},"848":{"dur":4,"text":"one that's just going to be just as nice, about a hundred and ten. (Graeme) And then obviously"},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"just your compressor and your lines. (Lynette) And look, you can get a compressor anywhere. You can"},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"actually buy the little smart compressors (Graeme) Yep. (Lynette)  that are silent"},"860":{"dur":4,"text":"and they can go into anybody's flat and unit. Now I'm going to choose"},"864":{"dur":4,"text":"Burnt Sienna this time. (Graeme) Right. (Lynette) So once again I actually haven't had"},"868":{"dur":4,"text":"the transparent - the airbrush Extender in these, cause I haven't"},"872":{"dur":4,"text":"felt the need to I'm not having to detail a lot - I'm just coloring. (Graeme) Okay."},"876":{"dur":4,"text":"(Lynette) So this is not - it's not critical."},"880":{"dur":4,"text":"So as you can see this is really going to really orange him up. (Graeme) Yeah, sure does"},"884":{"dur":4,"text":"isn't it? (Lynette) I love this beautiful, you know"},"888":{"dur":4,"text":"sienna color against this, you know the Colbert turquoise"},"892":{"dur":4,"text":"here. (Graeme) And I must admit you have a fantastic studio"},"896":{"dur":4,"text":"and a gallery, but we're in Melbourne and we've got a tin roof,"},"900":{"dur":4,"text":"and we've got four seasons in one day in Melbourne. (Lynette) Yeah, you can hear the rain. (Graeme) Yeah."},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"(Lynette) So I'm just leaving that muzzle area cause it's"},"908":{"dur":4,"text":"not orange really. So"},"912":{"dur":4,"text":"um, it has more softer greys, (Graeme) Yeah. (Lynette) has little reflections"},"916":{"dur":4,"text":"like just under the nostril here will have a reflection of this color."},"920":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) Yep. (Lynette) But yeah, I try, try not just cover the whole lot."},"924":{"dur":4,"text":"So now I'm just going to come in with some darker browns,"},"928":{"dur":4,"text":"and all those shadow that I had before, I'm actually"},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"just enhancing with a bit more depth of color. (Graeme) Okay. (Lynette) And this is where I'll start"},"936":{"dur":4,"text":"to bring in some detail of the eye as well, and you get these beautiful"},"940":{"dur":4,"text":"soft shading in the eye. (Graeme) It's a matter of perfecting that"},"944":{"dur":4,"text":"finger movement back and forth, it's very slight isn't it?"},"948":{"dur":4,"text":"(Lynette) It is, and you know when it comes to real sharp detail"},"952":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) Yep. (Lynette) you've got to be really precise (Graeme) Yep. (Lynette) and it's just"},"956":{"dur":4,"text":"a matter of practice. So basically what I'm doing"},"960":{"dur":4,"text":"here is I'm just going over my darks again, just reinforcing"},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"that color. (Graeme) Aha. You just get to the stage were you're refining, refining,"},"968":{"dur":4,"text":"refining, and (Lynette) Yeah, absolutely. (Graeme) more and more and more. (Lynette) Yep, so"},"972":{"dur":4,"text":"on this one I can't see a lot of his veins - I've got a few in"},"976":{"dur":4,"text":"there, but yeah, just trying to refine the veins in the"},"980":{"dur":4,"text":"painting as well. (Graeme) So you say airbrush is your favourite"},"984":{"dur":4,"text":"medium? (Lynette) Yeah, it is actually. I really,"},"988":{"dur":4,"text":"really enjoy the fact that you can get this"},"992":{"dur":4,"text":"realism from it, and it's so easy to do. (Graeme) Yeah."},"996":{"dur":4,"text":"(Lynette) It's a lot harder to get the blending effects via brush than"},"1000":{"dur":4,"text":"what it is to do with airbrush (Graeme) Oh god yeah. (Lynette) and I just find that yeah, the"},"1004":{"dur":4,"text":"technique that is used to get these, these finished pieces"},"1008":{"dur":4,"text":"I really enjoy. (Graeme) Yeah, if you were painting that"},"1012":{"dur":4,"text":"with oils or acrylics you'd wouldn't"},"1016":{"dur":4,"text":"be anywhere near you are now. (Lynette) Oh no, (Graeme) Yeah. (Lynette) no. So just coming in"},"1020":{"dur":4,"text":"with a little bit more detail here. Now I've really colored up the"},"1024":{"dur":4,"text":"where the pupils going to go, so just need to dry"},"1028":{"dur":4,"text":"that off so I'm just blowing cold air onto it, or the compressed air."},"1032":{"dur":4,"text":"So I've just picked up the white airbrush, not to say that it is a"},"1036":{"dur":4,"text":"white airbrush: it's silver. But I've actually picked up my second airbrush that I had"},"1040":{"dur":4,"text":"the white in previously, and I'm just going to start on the muzzle. (Graeme) There's a lot"},"1044":{"dur":4,"text":"of artists do use stencils but you're that proficient at doing this"},"1048":{"dur":4,"text":"that you do it mostly freehand which is, it's not - it"},"1052":{"dur":4,"text":"looks easy, but it's really not easy to do. (Lynette) No, you're right."},"1056":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a lot of practice. So I'm over highlighting, just"},"1060":{"dur":4,"text":"so I can get that white back in, and then obviously we'll knock that back with"},"1064":{"dur":4,"text":"another set of colors. (Graeme) I was going to say with your"},"1068":{"dur":4,"text":"commissioned pieces you go right out; I mean you prefer to take your own photos."},"1072":{"dur":4,"text":"You'll go to the property where the horses actually are and then"},"1076":{"dur":4,"text":"look at the animal and learn to understand it, and take your photos"},"1080":{"dur":4,"text":"to get the best result.
