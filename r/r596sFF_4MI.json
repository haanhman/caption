happen."},"1802":{"dur":4,"text":"What you see is, I pulled on quark out\nand this piece of bubble split into two,"},"1806":{"dur":2,"text":"but a second quark was actually created\nto the-- accompanying the first."},"1808":{"dur":1,"text":"And the reason is because\nas you pull the bubble,"},"1810":{"dur":2,"text":"the bubble is like pulling on a rubber

have a free quark"},"1827":{"dur":3,"text":"but you have a quark bound inside\nof another piece of nuclear matter."},"1830":{"dur":0,"text":"Quarks are numerous."},"1831":{"dur":4,"text":"So the

color."},"1841":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, this is one reason you could tell that\ntheoretical physicists are-- so we say tilted."},"1847":{"dur":3,"text":"[Laughter] Because if theoretical\nphysicist were as rational as chemists,"},"1851":{"dur":2,"text":"instead of calling this color, we\nwould something like electronegativity"},"1854":{"dur":3,"text":"because that's what chemist call a,\nroughly

behavior with the exception"},"1897":{"dur":2,"text":"that you cannot speed them\nup nor slow them down."},"1900":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's like having a basketball on your\nfinger that just spins at
