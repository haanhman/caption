First of all, when\ndoes the coin drop?"},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"MACHON: Well, the coin dropped pretty quickly,\nbecause, of course, they lied to me during"},"221":{"dur":1,"text":"recruitment, saying that they didn't do political\nwork."},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"JAY: What do you mean by political work?"},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"MACHON: Looking at subversives, people who\nare radical, either very left-wing [incompr.]"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"JAY: So investigating people simply 'cause\nof their political activities."},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"MACHON: Exactly. And when I say investigating,\nI mean incredibly invasive. So they could"},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"put bugs in their properties, they could bug\ntheir phones, they could follow them around,"},"238":{"dur":1,"text":"they could send undercover people in to report\non them."},"239":{"dur":1,"text":"JAY: And what kind of people were they targeting?"},"241":{"dur":4,"text":"MACHON: Oh, tiny little Trotskyist groups,\nthings like--they were called \"militant tendency\""},"245":{"dur":1,"text":"or Socialist Workers Party."},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"JAY: Why would they bother?"},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"MACHON: Well, indeed.

So this was a problem.\nThey were shutting down the section. So at"},"262":{"dur":4,"text":"least that sort of stopped in the mid 1990s.\nUnfortunately, then the role of spying on"},"267":{"dur":4,"text":"left-wing groups was taken over by the secret\npolice, who then ran undercover cops into"},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"these groups.

That's"},"304":{"dur":4,"text":"when they focused on the IRA, the provisional\nIRA in Northern Ireland. They took that work"},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"off the police.

And, in fact, my second posting was\nto that section."},"316":{"dur":4,"text":"And David also moved into T Branch, as it\nwas called, and then moved into G Branch,"},"320":{"dur":5,"text":"which was international. And we saw a sort\nof escalation of issues that troubled us in"},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"both those sections. I mean, certainly in\nthe Irish section, bombs that could and should"},"330":{"dur":5,"text":"have been prevented by MI5 were detonated\non the U.K. mainland, killing people, and"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"MI5 would then lie to government to cover\nup their mistakes."},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"JAY: And these were mistakes?"},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"MACHON: They were mistakes, yes."},"341":{"dur":6,"text":"JAY: I mean, sometimes there's been some suggestion\nthey're errors of deliberate omission, that"},"348":{"dur":4,"text":"sometimes it's not so bad if a bomb goes off\nhere or there, 'cause it again justifies even"},"352":{"dur":4,"text":"more effort to stop such things. Any whiff\nof that?"},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"MACHON: There's certainly a whiff, yes. And,\nof course, when they were working against"},"359":{"dur":4,"text":"the IRA, it was very different from working\nagainst al-Qaeda, because the IRA had a system"},"364":{"dur":6,"text":"of issuing passwords, codewords before an\nexplosion. So they were quite sophisticated"},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"in their PR offensive. They would put a bomb\ndown and then warn the police so that nobody"},"374":{"dur":6,"text":"would get hurt, so they'd just have sort of\nthe PR hit of the bomb detonating. So, yes,"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"I think some of that might have happened as\nwell."},"383":{"dur":4,"text":"But it was really in the third posting that\nwe saw the major issues. There was, first"},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"of all, an illegal telephone tap on a very\nfamous left-wing journalist in the U.K. on"},"392":{"dur":5,"text":"The Guardian newspaper. There was also the\nimprisoning and the conviction of two innocent"},"397":{"dur":5,"text":"people for conspiracy to bomb the Israeli\nembassy in 1994 in London, and MI5 had evidence"},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"that they were innocent, and still let them\ngo ahead and be convicted."},"405":{"dur":0,"text":"JAY: Why?"},"406":{"dur":4,"text":"MACHON: Why? That's a very good question,\nbecause MI5's assessment, after they'd looked"},"410":{"dur":4,"text":"at all the evidence around this case, was\nthat Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency,"},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"had carried out a controlled explosion outside\ntheir own embassy in order to, one, increase"},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"the security around all their interests in\nLondon--which they'd been pushing for for"},"423":{"dur":5,"text":"years, and MI5 kept telling them to, you know,\ntake a hike--and also to frame these two innocent"},"429":{"dur":5,"text":"people who were involved in Palestinian support\nnetworks in London. And that network was gaining"},"434":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of traction politically and financially.\nAnd, of course, once you finger two innocent"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"people, the whole network just disappeared."},"441":{"dur":6,"text":"JAY: So you're saying this as if you know\nthis to be true. Has this evidence risen to"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"the public level? Has anything happened?"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"MACHON: Oh, absolutely. I mean, during the\nwhistleblowing years, this was one of the"},"451":{"dur":5,"text":"things that came out. And there was indeed\nan appeal for the two people in prison. And"},"457":{"dur":4,"text":"they admitted that there were documents within\nMI5, but they weren't going to disclose them,"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"because they didn't have to under the secrecy\nlaws. So the two people who had to finish"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"their sentences, they got 20 years in prison\neach."},"467":{"dur":0,"text":"JAY: They did?"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"MACHON: Yeah. So the judge went against all--."},"470":{"dur":0,"text":"JAY: They did most of 20 years?"},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"MACHON: They did most of 20 years."},"472":{"dur":0,"text":"JAY: That's insane."},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"MACHON: It was a young woman called Samar\nAlami and a young man called Jawad Botmeh."},"475":{"dur":6,"text":"And there was a huge campaign to release them\nand everything. It was a big, big scandal."},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"But the judge just ignored all case law and\nlet them rot in prison."},"486":{"dur":5,"text":"JAY: Alright. So was that one of the things\nthat starts to inspire you that this is--I"},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"can't live with myself doing this?"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"MACHON: Pretty much, yes. I mean, it was a\nsort of process of boiling the frog when we"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"were in MI5. Things got worse and worse."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"JAY: So when's the moment you look around\nand say, okay, I'm turning into frog's legs?"},"502":{"dur":6,"text":"MACHON: Well, that sort of came to a head,\ncame to the boil in 1995, because David Shayler,"},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"my partner at the time, was the head of the\nliving section in MI5. And he had an unusually"},"513":{"dur":4,"text":"close working relationship with his counterpart\nin MI6, the foreign intelligence agency. And"},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"he was briefed officially about a plot that\nMI6 was involved in--and some of his colleagues"},"522":{"dur":5,"text":"were, too; it wasn't just David. And this\nwas basically MI6 funding a bunch of Islamic"},"527":{"dur":4,"text":"extremist terrorists in Libya. And this group\nhad links with al-Qaeda, which was a known"},"532":{"dur":6,"text":"terrorist group even then, which MI5 was investigating.\nAnd MI6 was funding this group. And what they"},"538":{"dur":4,"text":"were doing was helping to foment a coup against\nGaddafi. So the group--."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"JAY: But to investigate, they just, I assume,\ncould have phoned the CIA and asked, because"},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"the CIA had, certainly at the beginnings of\nal-Qaeda, at least, something to do with it."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"MACHON: Absolutely, yes. I mean, you know,\nall the support they gave them during the"},"553":{"dur":5,"text":"Mujahideen in Afghanistan, no doubt about\nit. But no, MI6 always liked to talk the talk."},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"They liked to think they were big James Bond\nfigures. And this was an opportunity to do"},"562":{"dur":5,"text":"something, I think. And also, the quid pro\nquo was that if Gaddafi was toppled, this"},"567":{"dur":4,"text":"group would seize power and then would start\nbuilding nice, lucrative oil contracts with"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"British Petroleum and all the other companies.\nSo that seemed to be what they were after."},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"JAY: Yeah, it worked out really well in Afghanistan."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"MACHON: Yeah, I know. They never seem to learn\nfrom history. They're doomed to make the same"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"mistakes again and again."},"581":{"dur":5,"text":"So this group was funded by MI6. And David\nwas concerned about this and reported it all"},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"the way up the management chain, but sort\nof thought they wouldn't do it. MI6 always"},"590":{"dur":5,"text":"talked big and did little. But then, in early\n1996, a lot of intelligence reports--."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"JAY: [incompr.] he's in MI5 or MI6?"},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"MACHON: He's in MI5 along with me. He's the--."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"JAY: And you get wind of this MI6 plan."},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"MACHON: He is officially briefed by his counterpart\nin MI6 over a period of months. So this was"},"606":{"dur":0,"text":"building up for a while."},"607":{"dur":4,"text":"JAY: And he, up the food chain of MI5, says,\nare you guys aware of what MI6 is planning"},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"MACHON: Yeah, and nobody seemed bothered,\npartly because MI6 would [crosstalk]"},"614":{"dur":5,"text":"JAY: So just to get clear, this is a plan\nto use al-Qaeda type groups in Libya to assassinate"},"620":{"dur":0,"text":"the leader of Libya."},"621":{"dur":6,"text":"MACHON: Yes, at a time when al-Qaeda was known\nto be an enemy of the West. So MI5 was investigating"},"628":{"dur":5,"text":"them; MI6 was funding them. And that was how\ncrazy it was. Crucially, as well, this operation"},"634":{"dur":5,"text":"was illegal under U.K. law, because under\nthe Intelligence Services Act 1994, MI6 can"},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"commit crimes abroad with legal impunity,\nbut only if they get the prior written permission"},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"of their political master, the foreign secretary.\nIn this case, they didn't get it, so it was"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"illegal as well as immoral and unethical."},"651":{"dur":6,"text":"And in early 1996, Gaddafi was returning from\nSirte, in Libya, to Tripoli in a cavalcade"},"658":{"dur":4,"text":"of cars, and an explosion occurred under one\nof the cars--obviously, the wrong one, because"},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"Gaddafi survived. But there was a security\nshoot-out afterwards, and innocent bystanders"},"667":{"dur":5,"text":"were gunned down. So we're looking at an illegal\noperation funding our terrorist enemies, which"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"goes wrong and also kills innocent people."},"674":{"dur":6,"text":"JAY: Now, just to back up, MI6 doesn't have\nthe official sanction. But is there a suggestion"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"here this is being done without the political\nmasters knowing?"},"684":{"dur":0,"text":"MACHON: Yes."},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"JAY: So it's--I mean, this is a kind of rogue\nMI6 operation."},"688":{"dur":6,"text":"MACHON: Yes, completely rogue and completely\nillegal. And yet roll forward a few years,"},"694":{"dur":4,"text":"and David has blown the whistle on this and\ngone to prison for it. The MI6 officers involved"},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"were never even arrested, certainly not charged\nor convicted. They were just protected by"},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"MI6."},"705":{"dur":5,"text":"JAY: Why would MI6 do something like this\nwithout the political masters knowing? I mean,"},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"how much of this goes on, do you think, where\nthey have their kind of own agenda about how"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"the world should look?"},"715":{"dur":4,"text":"MACHON: Well, it's very much a sort of network\nof old public schoolboys, so, you know, as"},"719":{"dur":4,"text":"chaps might talk casually to each other. But\nI think the major problem is cultural, because"},"723":{"dur":6,"text":"until 1994, MI6 had operated outside the law.\nIt was only in 1994 the new law came in which"},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"said they should get permission to do this\nsort of thing. And I think by 1995 the old"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"boys hadn't really got to grips with the fact\nthey had to follow the law. I think it was"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"just that simple."},"740":{"dur":5,"text":"I mean, it's noticeable now, of course. You\nroll forward to 2011 and the war in Libya,"},"745":{"dur":4,"text":"the NATO invasion, and MI6 people were on\nthe ground in Libya helping the Benghazi rebels,"},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"and most of those rebels were the very same\ngroups that they'd been funding in 1996 secretly."},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"This time they were funding and training and\nhelping them overtly."},"757":{"dur":4,"text":"JAY: I think it is important, I think, from\nwhat I know of the Benghazi situation, that"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"is, one segment of the rebels, 'cause there\nwere a lot of people involved in that rebellion"},"765":{"dur":5,"text":"that were not al-Qaeda and not linked to MI6\nor, we should add, French intelligence, 'cause"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"the French were up to their eyeballs in all\nof this."},"773":{"dur":5,"text":"JAY: And also, just for the sake of the record,\nwe shouldn't jump over the fact that after"},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"this '96-'97 period you're talking about,\nGaddafi made his grand bargain with Cheney"},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"and Bush and had kind of had his rapprochement,\nincluding with the British, and Gaddafi's"},"789":{"dur":4,"text":"son was running around with British lords\nand Rothschilds and other people."},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"MACHON: Well, again, there's some interesting\nhistory there, because we know (it's on the"},"797":{"dur":6,"text":"public record) that the Shayler case was one\nof the negotiating factors between the Gaddafi"},"803":{"dur":5,"text":"regime and the Tony Blair government, that\nand the Lockerbie trial, you know, the two"},"808":{"dur":7,"text":"suspects that were wanted for the trial of\nbombing Pan Am 103 in 1988.
