actually in this study,"},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"you'd probably be a little stressed out."},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"Your heart might be pounding,"},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"you might be breathing faster,\nmaybe breaking out into a sweat."},"305":{"dur":4,"text":"And normally, we interpret\nthese physical changes as anxiety"},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"or signs that we aren't coping\nvery well with the pressure."},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"But what if you viewed them instead"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"as signs that your body was energized,"},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"was preparing you to meet this challenge?"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"Now that is exactly\nwhat participants were told"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"in a study conducted\nat Harvard University."},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"Before they went\nthrough the social stress test,"},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"they were taught to rethink\ntheir stress response as helpful."},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"That pounding heart\nis preparing you for action."},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're breathing faster,\nit's no problem."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"It's getting more oxygen to your brain."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"And participants who learned to view\nthe stress response"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"as helpful for their performance,"},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"well, they were less stressed out,\nless anxious, more confident,"},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"but the most fascinating finding to me"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"was how their physical\nstress response changed."},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, in a typical stress response,"},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"your heart rate goes up,"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"and your blood vessels\nconstrict like this."},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is one of the reasons\nthat chronic stress"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"is sometimes associated\nwith cardiovascular disease."},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not really healthy to be\nin this state all the time."},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"But in the study,"},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"when participants viewed\ntheir stress response as helpful,"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"their blood vessels\nstayed relaxed like this."},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"Their heart was still pounding,"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"but this is a much healthier\ncardiovascular profile."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"It actually looks a lot like what

change"},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"could be the difference"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"between a stress-induced\nheart attack at age 50"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"and living well into your 90s."},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is really what the new\nscience of stress reveals,"},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"that how you think about stress matters."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"So my goal as a health\npsychologist has changed."},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"I no longer want\nto get rid of your stress."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to make you better at stress."},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"And we just did a little intervention."},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"If you raised your hand and said"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"you'd had a lot of stress\nin the last year,"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"we could have saved your life,"},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"because hopefully the next time\nyour heart is pounding from stress,"},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"you're going to remember this talk"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're going to think to yourself,"},"436":{"dur":4,"text":"this is my body helping me\nrise to this challenge."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"And when you view stress in that way,"},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"your body believes you,"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"and your stress response\nbecomes healthier."},"450":{"dur":4,"text":"Now I said I have over a decade\nof demonizing stress"},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"to redeem myself from,"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"so we are going to do\none more intervention."},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to tell you"},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"about one of the most under-appreciated\naspects of the stress response,"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"and the idea is this:"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"Stress makes you social."},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"To understand this side of stress,"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin,"},"473":{"dur":4,"text":"and I know oxytocin has already gotten\nas much hype as a hormone can get."},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"It even has its own cute nickname,\nthe cuddle hormone,"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's released\nwhen you hug someone."},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"But this is a very small part\nof what oxytocin is involved in."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"Oxytocin is a neuro-hormone."},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"It fine-tunes\nyour brain's social instincts."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"It primes you to do things"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"that strengthen close relationships."},"501":{"dur":4,"text":"Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact\nwith your friends and family."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"It enhances your empathy."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"It even makes you more willing\nto help and support"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"the people you care about."},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"Some people have even suggested\nwe should snort oxytocin..."},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"to become more compassionate and caring."},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"But here's what most people\ndon't understand about oxytocin."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a stress hormone."},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out"},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"as part of the stress response."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"It's as much a part\nof your stress response"},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"as the adrenaline that makes\nyour heart pound."},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"And when oxytocin is released\nin the stress response,"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"it is motivating you to seek support."},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"Your biological stress response"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"is nudging you to tell\nsomeone how you feel,"},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"instead of bottling it up."},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"Your stress response wants\nto make sure you notice"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"when someone else\nin your life is struggling"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"so that you can support each other."},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"When life is difficult,"},"565":{"dur":4,"text":"your stress response wants you\nto be surrounded"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"by people who care about you."},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, so how is knowing this side\nof stress going to make you healthier?"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, oxytocin doesn't only act\non your brain."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"It also acts on your body,"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"and one of its main roles in your body"},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"is to protect your cardiovascular system\nfrom the effects of stress."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a natural anti-inflammatory."},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"It also helps your blood vessels\nstay relaxed during stress."},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"But my favorite effect on the body\nis actually on the heart."},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"Your heart has receptors for this hormone,"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"and heal from any stress-induced damage."},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"This stress hormone\nstrengthens your heart."},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"And the cool thing\nis that all of these physical benefits"},"618":{"dur":5,"text":"of oxytocin are enhanced\nby social contact and social support."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you reach out\nto others under stress,"},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"either to seek support\nor to help someone else,"},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"you release more of this hormone,"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"your stress response becomes healthier,"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"and you actually recover\nfaster from stress."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"I find this amazing,"},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"that your stress response\nhas a built-in mechanism"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"for stress resilience,"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"and that mechanism is human connection."},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to finish by telling you\nabout one more study."},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"And listen up, because this study\ncould also save a life."},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"This study tracked about 1,000 adults\nin the United States,"},"661":{"dur":4,"text":"and they ranged in age from 34 to 93,"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"and they started the study by asking,"},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"\"How much stress have you\nexperienced in the last year?\""},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"They also asked,"},"674":{"dur":4,"text":"\"How much time have you spent\nhelping out friends, neighbors,"},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"people in your community?\""},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"And then they used public records\nfor the next five years"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"to find out who died."},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, so the bad news first:"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"For every major stressful life experience,"},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"like financial difficulties\nor family crisis,"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"that increased the risk\nof dying by 30 percent."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"But -- and I hope you\nare expecting a \"but\" by now --"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"but that wasn't true for everyone."},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"People who spent time caring for others"},"710":{"dur":4,"text":"showed absolutely no stress-related\nincrease in dying."},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"Zero."},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"Caring created resilience."},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we see once again"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"that the harmful effects\nof stress on your health"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"are not inevitable."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"How you think and how you act"},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"can transform your experience of stress."},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"When you choose to view\nyour stress response as helpful,"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"you create the biology of courage."},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"And when you choose to connect\nwith others under stress,"},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"you can create resilience."},"749":{"dur":5,"text":"Now I wouldn't necessarily ask\nfor more stressful experiences in my life,"},"755":{"dur":5,"text":"but this science has given me\na whole new appreciation for stress."},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"Stress gives us access to our hearts."},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"The compassionate heart\nthat finds joy and meaning"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"in connecting with others,"},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"and yes, your pounding physical heart,"},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"working so hard to give you\nstrength and energy."},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"And when you choose to view\nstress in this way,"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"you're not just getting better at stress,"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"you're actually making\na pretty profound statement."},"789":{"dur":5,"text":"You're saying that you can trust yourself\nto handle life's challenges."},"795":{"dur":4,"text":"And you're remembering\nthat you don't have to face them alone."},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause)"},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"Chris Anderson: This is kind\nof amazing, what you're telling us."},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"It seems amazing to me\nthat a belief about

making\na lifestyle choice"},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"between, say, a stressful job\nand a non-stressful job,"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"does it matter which way they go?"},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"It's
