the first things\nthat you can do if you"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"haven't already\ndone this is mulch."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"Simply putting some mulch\non the ground will help"},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"retain moisture in the\nsoil and it will also keep"},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"the temperature more stable\nfor the roots of your plants."},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"It can also help\nwhen it degrades,"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"it will add nutrients\nto the soil."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course, it prevents\nthat crust, because sometimes"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"when the water hits the\nsoil surface, it puts"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"a little crust layer on\nthe soil, and then when"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"it rains again, that\nlayer is so tight"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"that it lets water run off\nrather than soak in the ground,"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"and mulch helps\nprevent all of that,"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"so mulching is a great idea."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"Another thing that you\ncan do to help yourself"},"605":{"dur":4,"text":"and your plants is to\nwater either in the morning"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"or in the evening\nbefore the sun sets."},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"You've got to let the flowers\nand the leaves dry off"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"before the sun sets,\nbecause that's gonna set"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"a perfect scenario for\ndiseases to set in,"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"so you wanna prevent that,\nbut watering in the morning"},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"and watering in the evening\nis a nicer time of day,"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"it's cooler, morning is the\nbest if you can do that,"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"but you know with people's\nhectic schedules and trying"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"to get to work, as long as\nyou water in the evening"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"before the sun sets so that\nthe leaves can dry off,"},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"that's a good time to water."},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"Another thing you can do is\nplant groups of plants together"},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"that require the same types\nof water requirements."},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"And how will you know you've\ndone that, well, if you have"},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"a container or an area\nthat you planted a whole"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"different kinds of plants\nin there, you water 'em,"},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"and then some of them\ndie, well they don't like"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"that much water or you\ndon't water 'em enough"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"and some of 'em live, and\nsome of 'em didn't live"},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"because you didn't water enough."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"Well you'll know that\nthe water requirements"},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"for that particular plant that\ndidn't live is not conducive"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"to the other plants that\nyou've planted it with."},"680":{"dur":4,"text":"Good examples for some dry\nkind of flowers and plants"},"686":{"dur":4,"text":"that can take drought would\nbe like your Dusty Millers"},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"and your Lantanas,\nalso there's some grass"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"called Mexican feather grass,"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"it does really well\nwith dry areas."},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"Then of course for larger\ntrees, you've got your hollies,"},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"anything with, you gotta\nthink thick leaved,"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"anything that has got\na thick leaf on it"},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"like your Indian Hawthornes\nand your Magnolias"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"and your Hollies, those\nall can take some drought"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"because they have\nthicker leaves on them."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of herbs can do that\ntoo, you think of your sages"},"723":{"dur":4,"text":"and your oreganos and your\nrosemaries and the bay leaf,"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"all of those can take\nmore drought situation"},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"because they have\nlarger, thicker leaves."},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's see, also, Memphis\narea is very humid."},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Chris] Yes it is."},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"and I don't like putting water\nin the air to water things."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"If you can use soaker hoses,\nthat would be the best thing"},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"that you can do, because\nit puts water right on"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"the root zone where\nthe plants need it."},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"And you will save yourself\nmoney and time by having"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"soaker hoses, and just all\nyou have to do is go out"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"and hook up a soaker hose,\nand come back in and then"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"30 minutes later go out and\ncheck, and maybe give it"},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"another 30 minutes or\nnot, and you're done,"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"and you don't have to stand\nthere and water anything."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you can use some\nkind of system that puts"},"780":{"dur":4,"text":"as large of particles of\nwater as possible out,"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"you're not gonna be evaporating\na lot of it in the heat,"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"so you're not gonna make\nMemphis any more humid"},"789":{"dur":4,"text":"than it already is, but yes,\nand you'll save yourself money"},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"in the long run because you\nwon't have to use so much water."},"797":{"dur":4,"text":"And now if you have some\ntime, when you are planting,"},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"I highly recommend adding\norganic matter to the soil"},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"because soils here in this\narea are very small in size,"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"and they are very tightly\nheld together, there's not"},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot of air and water movement\nand space for the roots"},"820":{"dur":4,"text":"to even grow, so if you amend\nthe soil, organic matter"},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"will break that up and give\nyou larger areas to hold water,"},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"roots, and air movement."},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"So you're gonna do a\nbetter job for yourself,"},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"save yourself some time in\nthe long run and not use"},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"as much water if you have\nwater that stays in the ground"},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot longer, and organic\nmatter will help you do that."},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yes, I can hear Mr. Jim\nVogus in my head right now,"},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Pour space, that's what\nwe need, pour space.\""},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"- And organic matter will help\nyou do that, it sure will."},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"- Now let's go back to the\nmulchings for a second,"},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"so do you prefer\none over another."},"865":{"dur":3,"text":"- It depends on what it\nis, and where it's at."},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"I tend to like mulches that\nare gonna stay on the ground"},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"for a lot longer, and\nthat's like your cypress"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"and your cedar mulches,\nbecause you don't have to spend"},"878":{"dur":4,"text":"more money to add more mulch\nto the soil, and that's,"},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"I usually put those in areas\nthat I've already finished"},"884":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'm not gonna be digging\nin those areas anymore."},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"Another thing, if you've got\nslopes, you've gotta watch,"},"891":{"dur":4,"text":"you don't want something that's\ngonna run, so pine needles"},"895":{"dur":4,"text":"tend to really do well on\nslopes, and hold the soil"},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"and all the plants and\neverything so that's,"},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"I would prefer that, it\ndepends on the situation"},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"is what mulch I would\nprefer to put on there."},"908":{"dur":2,"text":"- I think about the pine\nneedles and the slopes, okay,"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"alright, makes sense, okay."},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"And you did mention about\nusing the soaker hoses"},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"because you don't want that\nfoliage to be wet, you know"},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"with the overhead watering which\nI see a lot in the evening,"},"922":{"dur":3,"text":"in my own neighborhood, yeah\nthat's just prime set up"},"925":{"dur":2,"text":"for fungal diseases\nand things like that,"},"928":{"dur":1,"text":"so we don't want\npeople to do that."},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"- And if you're really\ngood, then you'll have put"},"932":{"dur":3,"text":"the soaker hoses down and\nthen mulched on top of them,"},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"so you've got even, and in the\nsunlight, it'll look better,"},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"the sunlight won't degrade\nthe soaker hose, and they can"},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"stay in there for years and\nyears and years and years."},"945":{"dur":4,"text":"- And I do like the whole idea\nof grouping plants together"},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"of water requirements, I\nthink that's pretty smart."},"952":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah.
