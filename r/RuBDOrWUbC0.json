many of you have read the book"},"562":{"dur":0,"text":"and some of you have not."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'd like him to give us a sense"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"of what he's trying to do

were."},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"Actually, here's a really\nheartfelt thank you."},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you for noticing that the book"},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"is about something more\nthan either just parenting,"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"which is what parents tend to notice,"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"or an assault on the Ivy League,"},"597":{"dur":4,"text":"which is what, the quite\nfrankly very defensive,"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"reactively hostile reaction I've gotten"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"from people who are\nidentified or over-identified"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"with their own Ivy League credentials..."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughter)"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"Have been giving me and noticing"},"615":{"dur":4,"text":"that the book is about a\nlot of other things as well."},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"You started by saying that the book"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"is a book that's\nmuch-discussed and much-read."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm actually worried that\nit's one of these books"},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"that's so much-discussed\nthat it's not much-read."},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, I'd never felt the need"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"to read Sheryl Sandberg's book"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"because I already knew\nwhat she was saying."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe that's true, maybe it's not."},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"They're books like this."},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"So, if people actually read it"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"that would be even better,"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"especially if, as I\nthink is often the case"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"and may be the case with many of you here,"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"what you mainly know about the book,"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"you know because of the excerpt"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"that was published in the New Republic"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"about a month before the book came out."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"I do want to say about that excerpt,"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"which was actually presented\nas a stand-alone essay"},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"and was in fact an excerpt,"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"it was actually a collage\nof very short excerpts,"},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"assembled by the magazine\nwithout much input from me."},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"Every word is mine."},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"I think I would have presented\na little differently."},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"Also, then they put this title on,"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"Don't Send Your Kids To The Ivy League,"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"which people have really seized on"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"as if that's what I'm saying in the book,"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"as if I was only talking\nabout the Ivy League,"},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"if that's all I was saying,"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"if that's even really what I\nwas saying, even a little bit"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's terribly oversimplified."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"And then they also had that graphic"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"of the Harvard flag burning."},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not sure if that was photoshopped"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"or if they actually took the Harvard flag"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"out to the parking lot of\nthe New Republic building"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"and set it on fire."},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know."},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"So, look."},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"It got people's attention\nin a very big way."},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"And that was great, but at the\ncost of somewhat distorting"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"my message, if only by cutting out"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of what I had to say."},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I think the best way to explain"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"the rest of what I had to say"},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"is by going back and talking\nabout how the book came about."},"734":{"dur":4,"text":"I think you mentioned that\nsix years ago I published..."},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"The person who introduced us mentioned"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"that six years ago I published an essay"},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"in the American Scholar"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"called The Disadvantages\nof an Elite Education."},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"If I had known that people would read it,"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"I would have given it a better title."},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a very clumsy title."},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"It was actually rejected"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"by a much more prominent publication."},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"The editor said, you know, I like this"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"except that it's poorly\nwritten and poorly structured"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"and I want you to change the ending."},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"And then the American Scholar\nwas nice enough to publish it."},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"But it was the American Scholar,"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"which is a great little literary quarterly"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"whose readership soars\ninto the four figures."},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"(audience laughter)"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"And I figured nobody..."},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"- At times."},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"I figured nobody would read it."},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"What I didn't realize,\nalthough I should have by 2008,"},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"is that things don't get published"},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"in the American Scholar anymore."},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"They don't get published\nin the New Republic."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"Everything gets published in one place."},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"It gets published on the internet."},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"And by day three, it\nwas literally day three,"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"the piece, as they say, went viral."},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"It very quickly got about 100,000 readers"},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"on its way, six years\nlater, to over a million."},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think it's an interesting,"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"it was interesting the\nway it got to a million"},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"because, like I said,\nthere was an initial surge,"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"but mainly it just kept getting read"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"at the rate of a few thousand a month"},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"for year after year after year."},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"And I have a good reason to think"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"that most of the people\nwho were reading it"},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"were students at selective colleges"},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"or recent graduates of selective colleges."},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"Or eventually I think because\nof high school teachers,"},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"juniors and seniors at\nthe kinds of high schools"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"that send a lot of kids\nto the selective colleges."},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it basically circulated\nfor all these years"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"as a kind of samizdat,\nunderground literature,"},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"among that demographic."},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reason that I think that's true"},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"is that I also immediately started"},"860":{"dur":4,"text":"to get emails, ultimately\nhundreds of emails, from readers,"},"864":{"dur":4,"text":"and almost all of

this."},"934":{"dur":4,"text":"Maybe I needed to think about\nwriting a book eventually."},"938":{"dur":1,"text":"Another thing that\nhappened in the same vein"},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"was that students started to invite me,"},"942":{"dur":2,"text":"sometimes students and\nsometimes faculty members,"},"945":{"dur":1,"text":"but often students started to invite me"},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"to speak on their campuses."},"949":{"dur":1,"text":"The first one actually was at Harvard."},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a few months after\nthe article came out"},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"in the fall
