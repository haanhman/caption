Railroads."},"219":{"dur":7,"text":"The first commercial railroad, the Baltimore & Ohio,\nwas begun in 1828 and by 1860, there were more than\n30,000 miles of rails in the United States."},"227":{"dur":6,"text":"And on the communication side, we got the\ntelegraph, so no longer would Andrew Jackson\nfight battles two weeks after the end of a

information meant more\nrobust markets."},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"But perhaps the most important innovation\nof the time was the factory."},"245":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, when you think of factories, you might think of,\nlike, Chinese political prisoners making smartphones,\nbut early factories looked like this."},"251":{"dur":4,"text":"More than just a technological development,\nthe factory was an organizational innovation."},"256":{"dur":7,"text":"Like, factories gathered workers together in one\nplace and split up tasks among them, making\nproduction much faster and also more efficient."},"263":{"dur":8,"text":"The first factories relied on water power, which is the reason they were all east of the fall line \u2013 the geographic reason why there are so many waterfalls and rapids on the east coast."},"271":{"dur":4,"text":"But after 1840, steam power was introduced,\nso factories could be located in other places,"},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"especially near the large cities that were\nsprouting up in what we now know as the Midwest."},"279":{"dur":4,"text":"So the American system of manufacturing, which\ncentered on mass-production of interchangeable parts,"},"284":{"dur":7,"text":"grew up primarily in New England, but then it moved to the Midwest, where it spent its adolescence and its adulthood, and now its tottering decline into senility."},"291":{"dur":7,"text":"So, all these new economic features \u2013 roads, canals, railroads, telegraphs, factories \u2013 they all required massive up-front capital investment."},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"Like, you just can't build a canal in stages\nas it pays for itself."},"303":{"dur":4,"text":"So, without more modern banking systems\nand people willing to take risks, none of this\nwould have happened."},"307":{"dur":5,"text":"Some of these investments were facilitated\nby new business organizations, especially\nthe Limited Liability Corporation,"},"312":{"dur":5,"text":"which enabled investors to finance business\nventures without being personally  responsible\nfor losses other than their own."},"318":{"dur":4,"text":"In other words, corporations can fail without,\nlike, ruining their stockholders and directors."},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"People don't always like that, by the way,\nbut it's been very good for economic growth\nin the last 180 years or so."},"328":{"dur":5,"text":"So having angered a bunch of people by talking about the important role that big businesses played in growing the American Economy in the 19th century,"},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"I will now anger the rest of you by talking\nabout the important role that the state played."},"337":{"dur":4,"text":"In the 1830s, states began passing general incorporation laws, which made it easier to create corporations,"},"342":{"dur":9,"text":"and the Supreme Court upheld them and protected them from further interference in cases like Gibbons vs. Ogden, which struck down a monopoly that New York had granted to one steamboat company."},"351":{"dur":7,"text":"And the Charles River Bridge case, which said that building a second bridge over the Charles River did not infringe upon the charter of the first bridge."},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"In both those cases, the court was using its\npower to encourage competition."},"362":{"dur":5,"text":"And this brings up something really important about\nthe growth of American capitalism: government helped."},"367":{"dur":4,"text":"The federal government built roads and canals\nand its highest court protected businesses."},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"And states issued bonds to build canals and\noffered sweetheart deals to companies that\nbuilt railroads."},"377":{"dur":6,"text":"And despite what we may believe about the\nheroic risk-taking entrepreneurs building the\nAmerican economy through solitary efforts,"},"383":{"dur":4,"text":"without the government protecting their interests,\nthey wouldn't have been able to do much."},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"All right, let's go to the Thought Bubble."},"389":{"dur":5,"text":"The Market Revolution changed the landscape\nof work, which, for most of the prior 200 years,\nhappened at home."},"395":{"dur":8,"text":"Small-scale production of clothes and other goods had been done in the home, largely by women, and initially, this is how industrial production worked as well."},"404":{"dur":7,"text":"Factory owners would produce some of the products,\nlike patterns for shoes, and then farm the finishing \nout to people working in their houses."},"411":{"dur":9,"text":"Eventually, they realized that it would be more efficient to gather the workers together in one place, although the older, \"putting-out system\" continued in some industries, especially in big cities."},"420":{"dur":5,"text":"After the Market Revolution, more and more Americans\nwent to work instead of working from home."},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"The Market Revolution also changed the way\nwe imagined work and leisure time."},"429":{"dur":7,"text":"Like, on farms, the seasons and hours of daylight\nregulated the time for work, but in factories,\nwork is regulated by the clock."},"437":{"dur":5,"text":"Which, by the way, was one of the first products\nto be manufactured using the American system\nof manufacturing."},"442":{"dur":4,"text":"Railroads and shipping timetables further\nrequired the standardization of time."},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"Factories also made it possible for more people\nto do industrial work."},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"At first, this meant women."},"451":{"dur":9,"text":"The workers in the early textile mills at Lowell, Massachusetts, for instance, were primarily young, New England farm girls who worked for a few years in the mills before returning home to get married."},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"Women were cheaper to employ, because it was\nassumed that they would not be a family's sole\nbreadwinner."},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"At least, this was the excuse for not paying\nthem more at the time."},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"I can't remember what excuse we have now,\nbut I'm sure it's a great one."},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"Anyway, all of this meant that the nature\nof work had changed."},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"In colonial America, artisans worked for what they\ncalled their \"price,\" which was linked to what they\nproduced."},"479":{"dur":6,"text":"In a factory, however, workers were paid a\nwage according to the number of hours they worked,\nregardless of how much they produced."},"486":{"dur":7,"text":"This may not sound like a big deal, but working for wages with one's livelihood defined by a clock and the whims of an employer was a huge change,"},"494":{"dur":4,"text":"and it undermined the idea of freedom that\nwas supposedly the basis of America."},"498":{"dur":9,"text":"Thomas Jefferson had worried that men working in factories, dependent upon their employers, were inherently un-free, and that this would make them unfit to be proper American citizens."},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"And as it happens, many factory workers agreed\nwith him."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"Thanks, Thought Bubble."},"512":{"dur":6,"text":"So, one reaction to the restrictions of the\nwage worker was to engage in the great American\npastime of lighting out for the territories."},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"With less and less farmland available in New England,\nyoung men had been migrating west for decades."},"522":{"dur":4,"text":"And, after the War of 1812, this flood of\nmigration continued and even grew."},"526":{"dur":9,"text":"Between 1790 and 1840, 4.5 million people crossed\nover the Appalachian Mountains, and six new states\nwere created between 1815 and 1821."},"536":{"dur":5,"text":"Ohio's population grew from 231,000 in 1810\nto over 2 million by 1850."},"542":{"dur":7,"text":"People even took up the motto 'Malaria isn't\ngoing to catch itself!' and moved to Florida\nafter we purchased it from Spain in 1819."},"549":{"dur":6,"text":"Moving out West was a key aspect of American\nfreedom, and the first half of the
