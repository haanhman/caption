that\nI'm the first presenter"},"17":{"dur":3,"text":"at the Finance Summit, so\nI thought that I would try"},"20":{"dur":1,"text":"to set the stage by going back"},"22":{"dur":2,"text":"to first principles\non municipal finance."},"26":{"dur":2,"text":"So I've called my talk\n\"Financing Local Governments"},"28":{"dur":4,"text":"in the 21st Century, Going\nBack to First Principles.\""},"34":{"dur":2,"text":"Local governments as\nyou know are responsible"},"37":{"dur":4,"text":"for providing a wide range of\nservices to maintain the quality"},"42":{"dur":1,"text":"of life in your communities."},"44":{"dur":3,"text":"You provide hard services such\nas water, sewers and roads,"},"48":{"dur":2,"text":"as well as soft services\nsuch as culture facilities,"},"51":{"dur":1,"text":"parks, and libraries."},"54":{"dur":1,"text":"and we know that local\ngovernments that fail"},"56":{"dur":3,"text":"to provide these services will\nlose their economic advantage."},"60":{"dur":3,"text":"But local governments need\nadequate revenues to pay"},"64":{"dur":2,"text":"for these services and\nfor infrastructure."},"67":{"dur":2,"text":"But the question\nis, which revenues."},"69":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's what we're going\nto talk about this morning."},"73":{"dur":3,"text":"In my presentation I would\nlike to do six things."},"77":{"dur":3,"text":"The first thing is to provide\nsome principles and talk"},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"about the importance\nof linking revenues"},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"to the expenditures\nthat are being made."},"86":{"dur":2,"text":"Then I would like to talk about\nmunicipal finance in Canada"},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"and a little bit about\nsome other countries."},"92":{"dur":5,"text":"And try to explain how well we\nlink revenues and expenditures."},"97":{"dur":3,"text":"and then I will talk about\nthree different revenue sources"},"101":{"dur":1,"text":"that local governments use."},"103":{"dur":4,"text":"Property rates, user fees, and\nfederal and state transfers."},"108":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I will finish with\nsome final observations."},"111":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's begin looking"},"114":{"dur":2,"text":"at linking revenues\nand expenditures."},"117":{"dur":1,"text":"We can see the person"},"118":{"dur":4,"text":"in the slide here bearing\nthis burden of the tax."},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"And what is that person\ngetting for those tax revenues?"},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"Well in this particular\nslide they're getting a"},"127":{"dur":1,"text":"beautiful park."},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"They're also getting\nfire protection."},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"The point is that people want"},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"to see what they're\ngetting for their taxes."},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"And when we link\ntaxes and services,"},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"people are more supportive\nof paying those taxes."},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"We have some examples of\nthis in the United States,"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"where a number of\nstates held referenda,"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"or they call them\nballot initiatives to see"},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"if people will pay\nmore for transit."},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"So they might ask the question,\nwill you pay another one percent"},"159":{"dur":1,"text":"of the sales tax to pay"},"161":{"dur":1,"text":"for improved transit\nin your community?"},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"They're very clearly linking\nthe service you're going to get"},"166":{"dur":4,"text":"with the tax you're\nbeing asked to pay."},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"So when we're talking\nabout linking expenditures"},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"and revenues, we actually\nstart with the services"},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"that we're providing and then\nfigure out how to pay for them."},"181":{"dur":4,"text":"And what local governments\nprovide is a range of services."},"186":{"dur":4,"text":"And the four categories put here\nare private goods, public goods,"},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"goods that are redistributive,\nand goods that have spillovers."},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"So private goods are\nthings where we can identify"},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"who benefits from\nthat good or service."},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"And we can charge them for it."},"204":{"dur":3,"text":"Things like water,\nsewers, garbage, transit,"},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"these are things where\nwe know who's using,"},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"we can measure how much they're\nusing, and we can charge for it."},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"So the best way to\npay for these types"},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"of services is through\nuser fees."},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"The next group of goods that we\ncall public goods, they're goods"},"222":{"dur":1,"text":"that have public\ncharacteristics."},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"These are things where we\nknow the community benefits,"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"we have collective\nbenefits in the community."},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"But we can't identify the\nindividual beneficiaries."},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"So in this category\nwe have police, fire,"},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"local parks, streetlights."},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"So for example we all\nbenefit from street lighting,"},"242":{"dur":3,"text":"but we really can't identify\nhow much each of us benefits"},"246":{"dur":1,"text":"from standing under\na streetlight."},"249":{"dur":4,"text":"So these are goods that are\npublic goods that are best paid"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"for out of taxation."},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"The property tax is one\nway to pay for these goods,"},"258":{"dur":1,"text":"another is the sales tax."},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"And let me say these are\nnot all of the services"},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"that are provided by\nlocal governments,"},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm just putting\nthese up as examples."},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"And you'll see some are\nin more than one column"},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"because they can have more\nthan one characteristic."},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"The third group are\nredistributive goods."},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"These are goods where we're\nreally redistributing income"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"from high income taxpayers\nto low income taxpayers"},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"through social assistance,\nthrough social housing"},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"or other redistributive\nservices."},"290":{"dur":3,"text":"And we know that of all of\nthe taxes that are levied,"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"the income tax is the\nmost progressive tax,"},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"so it's the best way to pay\nfor redistributive services."},"300":{"dur":3,"text":"The last group are services\nthat exhibit spillovers,"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"or we in economics\nsay \"externalities.\""},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"These are services that spill\nover municipal boundaries."},"311":{"dur":4,"text":"If I'm a local government\nand I put a museum,"},"315":{"dur":4,"text":"for example in my community,\nI might expect that people"},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"from other communities\naround us will be coming in"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"and using that service."},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"But I'm only worried\nabout my tax payers."},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"So how do I pay for a\nmuseum that really spills"},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"over the municipal boundaries\nAnd the way to do that is"},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"through intragovernmental\ntransfers,"},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"where for example the\nstate government might say,"},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"well 30% of the benefits\nspill over your boundary,"},"342":{"dur":4,"text":"we'll pick up 30% of the cost,\nyou pick up the remaining 70%."},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"So again there are\ndifferent services"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"that local governments\nprovide and the way we pay"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"for them really depends"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"on the characteristics\nof those services."},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"We can do the same\nwith infrastructure."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"Just to give you a heads\nup I have two slides"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"on infrastructure, so these\nare not the only tools"},"367":{"dur":0,"text":"on this slide."},"370":{"dur":4,"text":"So there are some types of\ninfrastructure that are not"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"that expensive they\nhave a short life."},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"Like police cars, computers,\nthose are things that we can pay"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"for out of local taxes."},"383":{"dur":4,"text":"Some of the larger expenditure\nitems would mean a lot of taxes"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"in any one year for\nthat community."},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"If you were building\na bridge for example,"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"you couldn't put all of\nthat on the tax in one year."},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"But for those types\nof infrastructure"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"that have a short asset life,"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"taxes are an appropriate\nway to pay for them."},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"A gain where we can identify\nthe beneficiaries for things"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"like transit and\nwater, we can pay some"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"of those capital costs\nthrough user fees."},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"But for large-scale assets\nthat have a long life"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"where we have trouble\nidentifying the beneficiaries,"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"borrowing is a good way\nto pay for those assets."},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"Now that's not a source of\nrevenue, that's a financing tool"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"because we have to pay back\nthe borrowed funds either"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"through taxes or user\nfees or some other way."},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"But borrowing's a\nvery important tool"},"433":{"dur":4,"text":"because it's a very fair\ntool, an equitable tool,"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"because we may be building a\nbridge that will have benefits"},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"for the next 30 or 40 years."},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"So it makes sense to borrow\nthe money today and pay back"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"that borrowing over the\nnext 30 or 40 years."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we're doing is we're\nsaying the benefits extend"},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"over 40 years, we're going\nto pay for it over 40 years."},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"So that is what we call\n\"inter-generational equity.\""},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"We're matching up the\nbenefits and the costs"},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"over the life of the asset."},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"Three other ways to pay"},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"for infrastructure are\ndevelopment charges,"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"public-private partnerships,\nand land value capture taxes."},"476":{"dur":6,"text":"Development charges are charges\non developers on each lot"},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"that is related"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"to the growth-related\ncapital costs associated"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"with that development."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"Could be new development,\nit could be re-development."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"And it will pay for things\nlike water, roads, sewers,"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"so we're seeing that this\ndevelopment initiated the need"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"for infrastructure,\nincurred costs,"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"and we're asking the developers\nto pay for those costs."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"Of course, in many cases,\nthose developers will pass"},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"on the burden of the charges\nto the new home buyers."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"But they are the ones who\nare using the services."},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"Public-private partnerships,\na bit like borrowing,"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"is also not a source of\nrevenue to the municipality."},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"Public-private partnerships\nare a financing scheme."},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"Because the private sector\neither, borrows the money"},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"and needs to be paid back,\nor they need a revenue stream"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"to pay for the costs\nthat they've incurred."},"535":{"dur":4,"text":"So P3's are generally used\nfor large infrastructure--"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"roads, bridges, transit systems."},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"They need to have\na revenue stream"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"if the government isn't\ngoing to pay them back."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"And they need to have\nmeasurable results."},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"We need to know that\nthey're getting something"},"551":{"dur":0,"text":"for their money."},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"One good example"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"of public-private\npartnerships is on toll roads."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"The last one I want\nto talk about is land"},"560":{"dur":0,"text":"to value capture taxes."},"561":{"dur":5,"text":"So when a local government\nputs in a major infrastructure,"},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"for example, a transit line,\nthat increases the land values"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"around that transit line."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"So through no efforts\nof their own,"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"the landowners see their\nland values increase."},"578":{"dur":4,"text":"So is there a way to capture\nthat increase in land value"},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"through a tax to pay\nback the investment"},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"in the original transit\nline And the answer is yes."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is done in\na number of countries"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"to pay for infrastructure."},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"So those are some\nof the principles"},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"of financing local government."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"And now I'd like to\ntell you a little bit"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"about how we finance\nlocal government in Canada"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"and a little bit about\nsome other countries."},"610":{"dur":5,"text":"so let me start with a little\nbit of background first,"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"starting with the\nCanadian Constitution."},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"So like Australia,\nCanada's a federal country."},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"We have three levels\nof government."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"We have the federal government."},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"We have 10 provincial\ngovernments."},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"And 3 territorial governments."},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"And about 3,750 municipal\ngovernments."},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"That number is one that I use\nbecause there isn't one source"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"for the number of local\ngovernments in Canada."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I've actually\nadded them up myself"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"so I would say that's\nan approximate number"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"of municipal governments\nin Canada."},"651":{"dur":4,"text":"So the constitution divides\npowers and responsibilities"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"between the federal and\nprovincial governments."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"Local governments are\nnot really mentioned"},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"in the constitution except"},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"as there's being the\nresponsibility of the provinces."},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"We often refer to\nlocal governments"},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"as creatures of the province."},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"well why are they\ncreatures of the province?"},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"Well the role of the province"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"in local government\nmatters is pervasive."},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not unlike Australia."},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"So provincial legislation\ndetermines what municipalities"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"are responsible for doing what\nservices they have to provide"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"in what taxes and user\nfees they can levy."},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"The provincial governments also\nset the standards for service."},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"It may be water quality\nstandards."},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"It may be highway standards."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"The legislation in\neach province says"},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"that municipalities cannot\nrun an operating deficit."},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"They have to balance\ntheir operating budgets."},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"They can, however, borrow\nfor capital purposes,"},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"but borrowing is\nrestricted in most provinces."},"715":{"dur":4,"text":"So for example, in Ontario in\nthe province that I live in,"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"the borrowing rules say"},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"that debt charges\ncannot exceed 25 percent"},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"of own source revenue."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"In other words, the\nprincipal and interest costs,"},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"the debt charges\ncannot exceed 25 percent"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"of the revenues municipalities\ncollect themselves."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"In other words it\ndoesn't include transfers,"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"only their own source revenue."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the province has a role"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"because they give transfers\nto local governments."},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"They give unconditional\ntransfers,"},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"they may be per capita\ntransfers,"},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"they may be equalization\ntransfers,"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"and they will also give\nconditional transfers."},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"Those are transfers\nthat have to be spent"},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"on the specific function\nthat the province says."},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"So it may be social\nservices, roads, transit,"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"water, sewers, solid waste."},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"well what about the role\nof the federal government?"},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"Well the federal government\nhas a very limited role"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"in the constitution, in fact it\nhas no role in the constitution,"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of local governments."},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"But the federal government\ndoes have spending power."},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"And it can spend its\nmoney anywhere it likes."},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"And so it does from time\nto time, give transfers"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"to local governments in Canada."},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"There's something called the\ngas tax transfer which is used"},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"to be based on its gas tax\nrevenues, a portion was given"},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"to local governments\nacross Canada."},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"Now it's just a lump sum\ntransfer that's increased every"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"year by the rate of inflation."},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"But the federal government also\nprovides infrastructure grants,"},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"it provides grants for\nhomelessness, and depending"},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"on the economy, may provide\nsome ecpnomic stimulus grants"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"as it did after 2008."},"819":{"dur":5,"text":"So I'd like to turn to what\nmunicipalities actually do."},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's a bit difficult\nto do this Canada-wide"},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"because there are\ndifferences across provinces."},"831":{"dur":4,"text":"But we also have a problem with\nthe data that is not aggregated"},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"in a way that is\nparticularly useful."},"839":{"dur":4,"text":"So I've picked Ontario, which is\nthe largest province and looked"},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"at the division of municipal\nexpenditures for the year 2013."},"847":{"dur":4,"text":"And from this slide you can\nsee that the largest bunch"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"of expenditures is\nfor transportation--"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"at 23% of municipal\nexpenditures."},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"So that would include roads,\ntransit, streetlighting,"},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"sidewalks, anything to\ndo with transportation."},"866":{"dur":4,"text":"Another large group of\nexpenditures is protection"},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"to persons and property at 18%."},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"And that includes mainly\nfire and police protection."},"877":{"dur":5,"text":"Social and family services\nis also 18% but I have"},"883":{"dur":1,"text":"to say this is unique in Canada."},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"Ontario's the only\nprovince where the cost"},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"of social services are\nshared between the provincial"},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"and municipal governments."},"892":{"dur":1,"text":"This is not true across Canada."},"894":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is a special\nsituation here in Ontario"},"897":{"dur":1,"text":"and one we talk about\nquite a lot."},"899":{"dur":3,"text":"Environment accounts\nfor 14% of expenditures"},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"that includes water, sewers,"},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"garbage collection,\nand garbage disposal."},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there are\nother services as well--"},"912":{"dur":1,"text":"health and emergency services,"},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"and by health we\nmean public health."},"915":{"dur":1,"text":"Here we're talking\nabout immunizations,"},"917":{"dur":4,"text":"we're talking about making sure \nrestaurants are meeting current standards."},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"We're not talking about\nprimary care and hospitals."},"925":{"dur":4,"text":"Social housing is\nanother local function."},"931":{"dur":2,"text":"Recreation and cultural\nservices, planning"},"933":{"dur":2,"text":"and development, and\ngeneral government"},"935":{"dur":1,"text":"which just includes\nadministration."},"937":{"dur":4,"text":"So municipalities in Canada\nand in this case in Ontario,"},"943":{"dur":2,"text":"provide a very wide\nrange of services."},"947":{"dur":1,"text":"So how do they pay for them?"},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"Well the range is a bit smaller\nwhen we look at this chart."},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"The biggest chunk\nis property tax."},"955":{"dur":2,"text":"Property tax accounts\nfor almost 42%"},"958":{"dur":1,"text":"of local government revenues."},"960":{"dur":2,"text":"And I would say that this\nis true across Canada."},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"That number is pretty\nsimilar across Canada."},"966":{"dur":4,"text":"User fees account for almost 20%\nof local government revenues."},"970":{"dur":3,"text":"So that would include\nfees for transit, water,"},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"recreation centres, and\nthose kinds of services."},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"Transfers account for 21%."},"982":{"dur":2,"text":"That would be a lot higher in\nOntario than the rest of Canada"},"984":{"dur":2,"text":"because of the social\nservice costs."},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"So some of those social\nservice costs are covered"},"989":{"dur":1,"text":"through provincial transfers."},"992":{"dur":3,"text":"Then we have licenses and\npermits and some other revenues"},"995":{"dur":2,"text":"that include fines\nand license fees"},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"and other miscellaneous\nrevenues."},"1000":{"dur":5,"text":"Now in some of the provinces\nthere are other taxes as well."},"1006":{"dur":2,"text":"But these tend to\nbe fairly small"},"1009":{"dur":1,"text":"as a percentage of\ntotal revenues."},"1011":{"dur":5,"text":"So for example, some cities in\nCanada have a land transfer tax."},"1016":{"dur":1,"text":"I think you call\nthat a \"Stamp Duty.\""},"1018":{"dur":3,"text":"These are taxes that\nusually piggyback"},"1022":{"dur":1,"text":"onto the existing\nprovincial system"},"1023":{"dur":3,"text":"but the cities are allowed\nto put a little bit more"},"1027":{"dur":1,"text":"on that tax for municipal\npurposes."},"1030":{"dur":2,"text":"The city of Toronto where\nI live, for example,"},"1032":{"dur":1,"text":"has a land transfer tax."},"1035":{"dur":4,"text":"Sometimes they're amusement\ntaxes, there are some cities"},"1040":{"dur":1,"text":"in Canada that have a hotel taxes,"},"1042":{"dur":4,"text":"in one province there's\na pool tax."},"1046":{"dur":2,"text":"Some provinces allow\nmunicipalities"},"1049":{"dur":1,"text":"to levy a vehicle\nregistration tax."},"1051":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a particular\nfavourite of mine"},"1053":{"dur":2,"text":"as a way to reduce congestion."},"1056":{"dur":1,"text":"We actually had a\nvehicle registration tax"},"1059":{"dur":3,"text":"for a very short time in Toronto\nbut our mayor did not like it."},"1063":{"dur":1,"text":"He thought it was\nputting the war"},"1064":{"dur":1,"text":"on the car and he got rid of it."},"1066":{"dur":2,"text":"So we don't have one now."},"1069":{"dur":1,"text":"There's also billboard taxes."},"1071":{"dur":2,"text":"And in some provinces\nthere's revenue sharing."},"1073":{"dur":3,"text":"So a number of the provinces\nshare their fuel tax revenues"},"1077":{"dur":1,"text":"with their local governments."},"1078":{"dur":1,"text":"With the exception\nof revenue sharing,"},"1081":{"dur":2,"text":"these revenues are\nnot that significant."},"1084":{"dur":1,"text":"Certainly not when we're\nlooking at the property tax."},"1087":{"dur":3,"text":"So if we
