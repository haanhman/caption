out,"},"103":{"dur":2,"text":"and he started breathing\nreally quickly,"},"106":{"dur":4,"text":"then he breathed really slowly,\nupturned his body, and dove."},"110":{"dur":3,"text":"And he kept

have to do"},"270":{"dur":0,"text":"is get in the water."},"271":{"dur":0,"text":"They start triggering."},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"Obviously, he's honed his\nto go to great

minutes."},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can start now."},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"So the second he\nenters the water,"},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"something amazing happens."},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"His heart rates going to\nlower about 25% percent"},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"of his normal resting rate."},"300":{"dur":3,"text":"And blood is going to start\ncoursing from his

buoyancy"},"327":{"dur":0,"text":"zone."},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"So the ocean, instead of\npulling him to the surface,"},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"it's going to start pulling\nhim down to the sea floor."},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"And he will keep\ndropping down until he"},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"reaches the very bottom."},"337":{"dur":4,"text":"So you're going to see he's\nabout to kick off right now."},"342":{"dur":4,"text":"He's about to kick\nhis legs a little bit."},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"He's not going to move\nhis arms too much."},"347":{"dur":4,"text":"He's just going to effortlessly\nfall down into the ocean."},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"So every 33 feet, he goes down."},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"The air within his lungs\nis going to shrink in half."},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"So by around 100 feet,\nthe air in his lungs"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"is going to be about\nthe size of two fists."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"You can imagine how little air\nis going to be at 300 feet."},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"So his body really kicks\ninto overdrive now."},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"His lungs will\nengorge with blood"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"to stop themselves\nfrom caving in."},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"His organ walls are\nalso going to allow"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"for the freeflow\nof water and plasma"},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"to stop them from

minute."},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"So according to\nour understanding"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"of the human body, this\nis totally impossible."},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"A heart rate that low can't\nsupport consciousness."},"401":{"dur":4,"text":"And yet deep in the ocean, it\ndoes, and no one knows how."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"So the further he\ngoes, his

further\nand stay down deeper."},"418":{"dur":5,"text":"He's about to touch down now\nthe very bottom of the ocean."},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, this is supposed\nto be at around 300 feet."},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is when it gets\nreally difficult for him."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"He's got to make it back up\nagainst that pull of the ocean,"},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"back to the surface conscious."},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"But as you will soon see,\nNery is very experienced."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"He's going to take his time."},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"He's going to do a little\nair guitar in here for you."},"443":{"dur":4,"text":"He knows to save around 60% of\nhis oxygen reserve for the trip"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"back up."},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"So as he goes back up, all\nof those master switches"},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"within his body are\ngoing to begin reversing."},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"His mind is going to wake up."},"458":{"dur":4,"text":"Blood is going to push from his\ncore back to his extremities."},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"He's going to start resembling\nhis human form again."},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"When he's down this deep, he\ncan either choose to swim up"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"or to climb cliffs up."},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't matter,\nbecause that's"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"all of the water\npushing against him."},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"Freedivers don't\nget the bends when"},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"they're diving under\ntheir own natural ability."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"The human body\nnaturally knows how"},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"to purge all that nitrogen\ngas that has accumulated"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"during the deep dive."},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"And he's going to be purging\nthat here in a second."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"He's going to come up,\npause a little bit."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"It's been about three\nminutes and 50 seconds."},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"I know some of you are\nstill holding your breath."},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"There he goes."},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"And he's back at the\nsurface, and he's"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"going to try to do it\neven deeper next time."},"506":{"dur":5,"text":"So those are the basics of\nthe mammalian dive reflex."},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"So, competitive drivers\naren't the only ones"},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"that knew about this\nmammalian dive reflex."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"Cultures around the\nworld have used it"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"to harvest pearls,\nfood, sponges,"},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"whatever from the sea floor."},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"They've been doing it for\nliterally tens of thousands"},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"These are the\nJapanese ama divers,"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"who have been diving\nfor around 3,000 years."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"When sailors went out\nto Japan and saw them,"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"they reported that they\nwere able to dive down"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"around 150 feet--\nthat's pretty good--"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"and stay down there\nfor 15 minutes"},"543":{"dur":4,"text":"at a time, which, of course,\nis totally impossible."},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"And all the scientists\nwho heard these stories"},"550":{"dur":4,"text":"in the 16th and 17th centuries\ncalled the sailors' BS."},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"They said, no,\npeople can't do that."},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"You guys were drunk."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"You got it all wrong."},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"Even up until the\n1950s, scientists"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"said the deepest a human could\npossibly dive and survive"},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"was around 100 feet."},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"Any deeper and our\nlungs would collapse."},"571":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, modern freedivers are\nnow diving down to 800 feet"},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"on a single breath of air."},"578":{"dur":3,"text":"And the world record\nbreath hold is 12 minutes"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"and 10 seconds, so just about\ntwo and a half minutes shy"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"of these fabricated reports."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"And these guys haven't been\ndoing this for this long."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"Just about 20 years\nthey've been competing."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"So if they keep\ngoing at this rate,"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"they're going to dive\ndeeper and deeper,"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"hold their breath\nlonger and longer."},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"But the good news here\nis that freediving"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"is much more than competition."},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"When I was out\nthere in Greece, I"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"saw the ace divers\nmake it down very deep,"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"these incredible dives 300,\n350 feet and come up just fine."},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"But a lot of people\ndidn't come up just fine."},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"They came up conscious."},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"They came up with bloody noses."},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"One guy was technically dead\nfor about two minutes before he"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"was resuscitated."},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"It was the most insane thing\nI've ever seen in my life."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was also kind\nof sad and frustrating"},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"that they had honed this\nincredible ability to dive deep"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"and were just using\nit, most of them,"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"just for bragging\nrights, to say, hey,"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"I can dive deeper than you."},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"Hey, I'll challenge you to see\nhow long I can hold my breath."},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"But luckily when\nI was out there,"},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"I met some much more\nphilosophical freedivers"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"who use freediving as\nkind of a meditation,"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"like an underwater yoga."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"They never got hurt."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"They never resurfaced\nwith bloody faces."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"And they never came\nclose to dying."},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"They respected their\nlimits and used this"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"as a way of exploring\nthe ocean environment"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"and their own\namphibious abilities."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"And they also started using\nit for scientific research."},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's what I'm going\nto talk about next here."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"Because something\nelse amazing happens"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"when you freedive in the\nocean without scuba tanks,"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"without a boat,\nwithout a

they turn around"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"and they swim toward you."},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"They envelop you in their\nshoals and schools and pods."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"And they will stay\nthere for hours."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"They get really curious."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"They don't look at\nyou as prey, either."},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"Their prey doesn't go down\nand look them in the eye"},"704":{"dur":0,"text":"and hang out."},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"They look at you very curiously."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'll see in a little\nbit, dolphins and whales"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"start sending their\ncommunication whistles"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"and clicks to you because they\nthink they can contact you."},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"So it was with this\ngroup that I was"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"able to spend about 18 months."},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"They showed me how to freedive\nwith whales and dolphins."},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"They showed

imagine."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the most\ninteresting things"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"I thought they were working\non was echo location and click"},"738":{"dur":5,"text":"communication with cetaceans,\nwhich are dolphins and whales."},"743":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, let's start a\nlittle animation here."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"Eyes aren't much\ngood in the ocean."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"Half the time, it's completely\nblack, because it's nighttime."},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"And past around 1,500 feet,\nit's completely black,"},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"because light can't\nget down there."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"So what whales and\ndolphins have done"},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"is they've developed\ndifferent senses."},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"And we also have\nthese senses, and I'll"},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"show you that in just a minute."},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"A whale can echolocate."},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"What they do is they\nsend out a click,"},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"and they wait for the echo\nof that click to return."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"And they take that data,\nand they form a picture"},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"of everything around them."},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"It's basically a form of sonar."},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"And with this echolocation,\nthey can see better"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"than we can see with our eyes."},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"They can see a human\nfrom a mile deep."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"And a dolphin can\nsee a rice grain"},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"from around 300 feet away\njust with echolocation"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"by clicking and waiting for\nthe return of that click"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"to come back to them\nunder their jaws."},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"They don't receive\nit with their ears."},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"They receive it\nunderneath their jaws,"},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"which has the equivalent of\naround 10,000 little ears"},"806":{"dur":0,"text":"in it."},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"So, this goes on for a while."},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"We don't need to see that."},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"So, humans aren't that\ngood at echolocation,"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"but we're pretty good."},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"This guy is Brian Bushway."},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"He is completely blind."},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"He lost his optic nerves\nwhen he was 14 years old."},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"But he's taught\nhimself to click just"},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"like whales and\njust like dolphins"},"828":{"dur":4,"text":"and use those clicks to\nform a picture in his mind."},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"He lives a completely\nindependent life."},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"He can ride his bike\ndown busy city streets."},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"He camps alone in the woods."},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"He travels alone to different\ncountries just by clicking,"},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"waiting for the echoes of\nthose clicks to come back."},"849":{"dur":1,"text":"When some researchers\nin Canada took"},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"him and some other\nhuman echolocators"},"852":{"dur":3,"text":"and put them in an FMRI,\nthey had them echolocate,"},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"and they looked at their brain."},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"They found that the visual\ncortex of their brains lit up."},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"So to them, it was\nbasically no different"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"from what they
