And so maybe the water,"},"254":{"dur":5,"text":"for example Lake Thunderbird east of Norman,\nif you take a glass of water of Lake Thunderbird"},"259":{"dur":5,"text":"water and hold it up, you'll see a lot of\nof fine particles. We call that turbidity"},"265":{"dur":4,"text":"in the water, and it almost has a little bit\nof a reddish color to it. That's because the"},"269":{"dur":6,"text":"iron particles in those fine particles give\nthat color to it. Now those solids in the"},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"water may or may not be health issues, but\nthey're certainly not very pleasing to look"},"280":{"dur":7,"text":"at. Iron in the water, you may, if your groundwater\nhas reducing conditions in the absence of"},"287":{"dur":5,"text":"oxygen, you may get iron dissolved in the\nwater. Now, I remember a time when my wife"},"292":{"dur":5,"text":"was on an iron supplement diet, adding more\niron into her diet. At the same time, the"},"298":{"dur":6,"text":"city of Memphis was taking iron out of the\ndrinking water. So that wasn't a health standard."},"304":{"dur":4,"text":"That was because that iron that was in the\nwater, if it comes into the home and it's"},"309":{"dur":4,"text":"in your washing machine and that iron precipitates,\nyour white shirts or your white tablecloths"},"313":{"dur":6,"text":"become pink. And so that's more of an aesthetic\nconcern, a visual concern. So these are a"},"319":{"dur":4,"text":"couple of the reasons that we treat water:\nfor health concerns, that's the number one--to"},"324":{"dur":4,"text":"prevent the spread of disease, to prevent\nthe episodes of cholera and typhoid fever"},"329":{"dur":4,"text":"that we know from our history. But then there\nare also things that we do to make the water"},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"more pleasing for the consumer."},"335":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, the type of treatment we consider is\na function of the source of the water. We"},"340":{"dur":6,"text":"can have river water can be our source. Our\nsource could be a lake, like Lake Thunderbird"},"347":{"dur":5,"text":"for Norman.

And one of the first things we want"},"378":{"dur":5,"text":"to do is to remove that turbidity, to clear\nup that water so that it's more aesthetically"},"383":{"dur":5,"text":"pleasing. It turns out these particles are\nso fine that they won't settle out very quickly."},"388":{"dur":5,"text":"If you have river water like the Mississippi\nRiver, you have sand that will be in the water"},"393":{"dur":4,"text":"because of the the turbulence. The energy\nin the water will even be able to suspend"},"398":{"dur":4,"text":"sand, and that'll settle, the sand will settle\nout very quickly, but these fine clay particles"},"403":{"dur":5,"text":"will settle much slower. And so one of the\nfirst steps we do is to take that water and"},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"to make those fine particles so that they'll\ncome together and become larger particles,"},"413":{"dur":4,"text":"so that they will settle out by gravity. Now\nthe process that we use to get these fine"},"418":{"dur":6,"text":"particles to come together, we call them to\naggregate or conglomerate, is called coagulation."},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"And coagulation's a process whereby we take\nthese particles that normally don't want to"},"429":{"dur":5,"text":"attach, and we add some chemicals that change\nthe nature of the surfaces of these particles"},"434":{"dur":4,"text":"so that they will attach. And when they come\ntogether, they attach and they become larger"},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"and they'll settle out by gravity. And so\nthat we call that coagulation, and the process"},"444":{"dur":5,"text":"of the particles coming together and colliding\nand aggregating we call flocculation. Here's"},"449":{"dur":6,"text":"a picture from the Draper Water Treatment\nPlant in Oklahoma City, and in the left side"},"456":{"dur":6,"text":"of the picture what we see is this turbid\nwater look kind of brownish in nature. And"},"462":{"dur":4,"text":"we're doing the coagulation and flocculation.\nAnd as you look to the right part of the figure,"},"466":{"dur":5,"text":"you see the water is clear. In the basin we\nhave these these boards and and they look"},"472":{"dur":5,"text":"kind of like a paddle wheel on the back of\na paddlewheel boat, and these paddles rotate"},"477":{"dur":5,"text":"very slowly and encourage those particles\nto collide and aggregate so they become large"},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"enough. And so if you look beyond, you see\nthe water is clear because the larger particles"},"486":{"dur":5,"text":"that we've helped create now settle out of\nthe water, and the water is much clearer."},"492":{"dur":5,"text":"So the next step after coagulation, flocculation\nand settling, gravity settling, is we go into"},"498":{"dur":6,"text":"a filter. And here what we mean by a filter\nis a sand filter, a bed of sand that the water"},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"flows through and helps to further remove\nthese fine particles that haven't settled"},"508":{"dur":5,"text":"out by gravity. Actually this is from Bangkok,\nThailand, and they take water from the Chao"},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"Phraya River and then coagulate, flocculate\nit and then they put it in the sand filter."},"518":{"dur":5,"text":"You might say, well, where's the sand? What\nwe're seeing in this picture is the water"},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"as its flowing downwards. We can't tell that\nit's flowing downwards because it's doing"},"528":{"dur":4,"text":"it at a very slow rate, but it's flowing down\nthrough sand that's below the water surface."},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"So looking now at the next picture, we see\nwhat we've done is we've drained the water"},"537":{"dur":5,"text":"down in this basin to where now we're seeing\nthe top of the sand, and we're doing this"},"543":{"dur":4,"text":"because we're getting ready to clean the filter.\nWe've been using this filter long enough it's"},"547":{"dur":5,"text":"become very clogged with all the material\nthat's been removed in the sand. And so in"},"552":{"dur":5,"text":"this next picture we see what we've done is\nwe've begun to flush water back up through"},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"the filter in the opposite direction and we're\ndisplacing all this trapped material and we"},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"see the color of the water in this case is\nkind of brownish, and that reflects the brown"},"567":{"dur":5,"text":"particles that were in the surface water that\nwere trapped by the sand filter. But now we're"},"572":{"dur":5,"text":"cleaning that sand filter, removing all that\ndirt that had accumulated in it so that we"},"578":{"dur":6,"text":"can continue to use the sand filter for additional\ntreatment of water. So that was the sand filter"},"584":{"dur":5,"text":"for Bangkok, Thailand, which was treating\na surface water. Now if we look at the next"},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"picture, we see a sand filter, and this is\nfrom Memphis Tennessee. Now we see the color"},"595":{"dur":5,"text":"of this water is different. Instead of being\nbrownish or kind of like a a a chocolate milk"},"600":{"dur":4,"text":"or a weak chocolate milk color, we see it's\nreddish. And this reflects the fact that in"},"605":{"dur":5,"text":"Memphis, it's not the Mississippi River water\nthat they're treating, it's the groundwater."},"610":{"dur":4,"text":"And they're pumping the water up from the\nground, and that water has iron in it. And"},"615":{"dur":5,"text":"so what they're doing is they're precipitating\nthe iron, and then they're filtering out that"},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"iron in their sand filter. So what we're seeing\nin this picture is they're running water back"},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"through that filter in the opposite direction,\nand the iron is becoming displaced from the"},"630":{"dur":7,"text":"sand, and now we're regenerating that sand\nfilter so it can be used to treat additional"},"637":{"dur":7,"text":"water. So this would be the steps of coagulation,\nflocculation, sedimentation\u2014gravity settling,"},"644":{"dur":5,"text":"and now filtration, a sand filter to help\npolish or further improve the quality of the"},"649":{"dur":0,"text":"water."},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"But what's the most important reason that\nwe treat water? It's to prevent the spread"},"655":{"dur":6,"text":"of disease--cholera, typhoid fever. And so\nthe next picture we're looking at, this is"},"661":{"dur":7,"text":"a disinfection process, and here what we see\nare tanks. And these tanks have chlorine in"},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"them, and this chlorine is being added into\nthe water at just the right concentration"},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"to help disinfect that water, to kill any\npathogens that might be in the water.

Removing the iron,"},"690":{"dur":5,"text":"removing the turbidity, the solids\u2014that\nmakes the water more pleasant, but treating"},"695":{"dur":7,"text":"it with the disinfectant, that makes it safe\nand and prevents the spread of disease. So"},"702":{"dur":5,"text":"in this example I showed in Memphis, it was\nchlorine was the disinfectant. Chlorine gas"},"708":{"dur":6,"text":"added into the water to give a residual chlorine\nto make the water safe to drink. And you want"},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"to make sure that chlorine residual stays\nin the water distribution system, so the water"},"719":{"dur":5,"text":"coming out of the tap still has that, so the\nwater can't be re-contaminated by pathogens"},"724":{"dur":4,"text":"in the distribution system. This is why I\ndon't drink the water in a developing country."},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"In Bangkok, I've seen the water treatment\nplant. I trust the water at the water treatment"},"733":{"dur":5,"text":"plant, but I don't trust it at my hotel because\nI'm concerned that it might have been re-contaminated"},"738":{"dur":5,"text":"in the distribution system. And so in the\nU.S. and Europe, developed countries, we make"},"743":{"dur":5,"text":"sure there's a certain residual level of chlorine\nor disinfectant at the tap to keep that water"},"749":{"dur":6,"text":"safe. We can use other disinfectants, like\nozone or UV light. These can help to disinfect"},"755":{"dur":4,"text":"the water, and UV light and ozone are better\nfor Cryptosporidium and certain pathogens,"},"759":{"dur":4,"text":"but they don't leave a residual. They won't\nstay in the water all the way to the tap,"},"764":{"dur":5,"text":"so even if we use them, we need to add another\nchemical to keep that residual disinfectant"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"in the distribution system."},"772":{"dur":5,"text":"And just one more picture. I've shown you\na couple very large water treatment plants."},"777":{"dur":6,"text":"Here's a very small water treatment plant,\nand this is from a rural community in central"},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"Missouri. We were just driving by and saw\nthis and stopped and took the picture of it."},"787":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is a system where they're removing\niron, and what you're seeing are a series"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"of trays. They pump this water up, it has\niron in it, and they put it in these trays,"},"796":{"dur":5,"text":"and as the water flows from the top down through\nthese trays, it gets aerated, it gets exposed"},"802":{"dur":4,"text":"to oxygen. And the iron precipitates, and\nthen they're able to remove the iron. And"},"806":{"dur":4,"text":"so this is a small plant for a small community\nas opposed to the large plants that I've shown"},"811":{"dur":0,"text":"you before."},"812":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, having talked about water treatment,\nonce we use the water in our home, the water"},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"goes down the drain, and it goes to the wastewater\ntreatment plant. And we need to make sure"},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"that water is safe before it goes into the\nriver or lake or the receiving stream, and"},"825":{"dur":5,"text":"so next let's talk about wastewater treatment.\nSo we treat this wastewater to make it safe"},"830":{"dur":4,"text":"to discharge into the river or the stream.\nAnd one of the major concerns if that wastewater"},"835":{"dur":5,"text":"isn't treated as that waste goes into the\nriver and stream, it'll consume all the oxygen"},"840":{"dur":7,"text":"as the microorganisms consume those organics,\nthey'll use up the oxygen. And what happens"},"848":{"dur":5,"text":"to a river if it doesn't have oxygen in it?\nWell, what happens to the fish if there's"},"854":{"dur":6,"text":"no oxygen in the fish tank? Well, the fish\ndie, and so fish and other, many other organisms"},"861":{"dur":5,"text":"require oxygen to be able to live in the streams\nand lakes. And so what we want to do is we"},"866":{"dur":6,"text":"want to get these organics that are in this\nwastewater. We want to degrade that, and we"},"872":{"dur":4,"text":"want to provide all the oxygen that's necessary\nin a treatment plant so when that wastewater"},"877":{"dur":6,"text":"goes into the river, it doesn't deplete the\noxygen in the river. And so the way we do"},"883":{"dur":4,"text":"that is through a series of processes and\nwastewater treatment. So this next picture"},"888":{"dur":6,"text":"you're seeing is a picture of the Chao Phraya\nRiver in Bangkok, Thailand. My first trip"},"894":{"dur":5,"text":"to Bangkok in 1992 - I wanted to go see a\nwastewater treatment plant. The only thing"},"899":{"dur":6,"text":"is in 1992, Bangkok had no wastewater treatment\nplants. The human waste went into the ditches,"},"906":{"dur":4,"text":"into the creeks, and into the Chao Phraya\nRiver untreated. And the dissolved oxygen"},"911":{"dur":5,"text":"level in the river was virtually zero, which\nmeant no fish, no aquatic life could live"},"917":{"dur":6,"text":"in that water. I'm happy to report since 1992,\nBangkok has implemented wastewater treatment,"},"923":{"dur":4,"text":"and the Chao Phraya River now does support\nfish life again, but this is an example of"},"928":{"dur":4,"text":"what can happen in the absence. And we in\nthe United States, we were in that same position"},"933":{"dur":7,"text":"in the 1950s and 1960s before we started implementing\nthe wastewater treatment that we, is so common"},"940":{"dur":0,"text":"today."},"941":{"dur":4,"text":"When we look at a wastewater treatment plant,\nwhat's the first process that we might encounter"},"946":{"dur":5,"text":"at the plant?

And then we next go into\na process that just allows time for heavy"},"970":{"dur":4,"text":"things to settle out. And they say that one\nof the things that shows up in this settling"},"974":{"dur":5,"text":"basin initially--coffee grounds. Sometimes\npeople will flush that down the toilet and"},"980":{"dur":3,"text":"it makes it to the wastewater treatment plant,\nand so that gets settled out. And so we have"},"983":{"dur":5,"text":"simple physical processes of screening and\nthen gravity settling, and that removes those"},"989":{"dur":5,"text":"types of materials, but now we're starting\nto talk about those dissolved materials. We"},"994":{"dur":6,"text":"put some food down our food grinder or down\nthe garbage disposal that goes down the drain."},"1001":{"dur":3,"text":"We could take those things and put them out\nin the compost pile. And we have a compost"},"1005":{"dur":4,"text":"pile at our house and so those things would,\nthose organics would break down in a compost"},"1009":{"dur":5,"text":"pile, but sometimes we use our our garbage\ndisposal, and it goes down the drain. And"},"1015":{"dur":4,"text":"if that goes into the river, it'll consume\nthe oxygen in the river just like it consumes"},"1019":{"dur":5,"text":"oxygen in our compost pile as it degrades.\nAnd so now we need to think about: how can"},"1024":{"dur":6,"text":"we design processes to help remove those organic\ncompounds that won't be removed with the screens"},"1030":{"dur":5,"text":"or won't be removed by settling? So what we\ndo to remove these organics is actually somewhat"},"1036":{"dur":4,"text":"similar to what we do in a compost pile. If\nyou've ever worked with a compost pile you"},"1040":{"dur":7,"text":"put the organics, you always like to have\ncompost that's already been composted because"},"1048":{"dur":6,"text":"you can put that in, and that brings the microorganisms.\nAnd you need some moisture, you need water."},"1054":{"dur":4,"text":"And you turn your compost pile, and that's\nto keep it aerated.

We're taking"},"1122":{"dur":5,"text":"settled sludge and returning it. So we're\nbringing all these ingredients together so"},"1127":{"dur":6,"text":"that the organics can breakdown in this basin,\nin this engineered treatment system rather"},"1134":{"dur":5,"text":"than happening in the river itself. So what\nhappens in this basin is you have microorganisms."},"1139":{"dur":4,"text":"They see food, and they eat that food. To\nthem\u2014what to us is the wastewater to them"},"1144":{"dur":4,"text":"is food.
