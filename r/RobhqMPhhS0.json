two,"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"just put an X in the\nlast one, or one even."},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"But you do need to put three\nthings in to populate that."},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"So let us

introduce those\nthroughout the programme."},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, so let's have a look then."},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"We've got a Wordle here with\njust some very brief

anxious."},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"And that is really,\nreally normal,"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"because for some of you, this\nis a completely new journey."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"And those feelings are\nabsolutely natural."},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"And we hope that we can\nalleviate some of those fears"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"throughout this session."},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"OK, I think I have introduced\neverything, hopefully,"},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"that we have to introduce."},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"But no doubt there will be\nmore as people are popping in."},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to introduce\nGeorgina Blakeley, Georgina,"},"425":{"dur":0,"text":"welcome to the studio."},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"GEORGINA BLAKELEY: Hi."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Now,

here."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"I think the students\nhave already"},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"summed that up really well."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"They feel really excited,\nbecause there's everything"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"there, and you can't\nwait to get started."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"And as someone said, it's like\ngetting the box in the post."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"You want to open it up\nand see what's inside."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"But at the same time, they\nfeel very nervous and anxious"},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"as well, because it's difficult\nto know what to look at,"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"what to do first."},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"Students often say,\nI'm waiting for someone"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"to tell me what to do."},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's taking that\nfirst step, really,"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"that I think students\nfind very daunting."},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"So what should they do, then?"},"482":{"dur":0,"text":"GEORGINA BLAKELEY:\nWhat should they do?"},"483":{"dur":0,"text":"A very good question."},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Can they break\nanything on this, by the way?"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"GEORGINA

yet."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"So you've got some time to make\nthe most of that enthusiasm"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"and that desire to get started."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"So I would advise students\nto just start clicking."},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, once you're on Student\nHome, use that as your base,"},"502":{"dur":0,"text":"and then go from there."},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"You really can't break anything."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"You won't spoil it for\nany other students."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you fill in something\nor press something,"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"you haven't then altered\nit for every other student"},"512":{"dur":0,"text":"on your module."},"513":{"dur":0,"text":"So just have a go."},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"You really can't break

speaking,\nfor most people,"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"what's the structure of this?"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"And how does it work. then?"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"GEORGINA BLAKELEY: I think,\non most Open University module"},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"websites, or\nwebsites in general,"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"it's the central column\nthat's really important."},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"And you'll see here\nfor this student, who's"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"kindly let us use his\nStudent Home website,"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"at the start, you've got\nthe central column there,"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"which tells you which\nqualification you're on."},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"And this student is studying\npolitics, philosophy,"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"and economics."},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"Unfortunately, this student is\nnot actually doing any modules"},"554":{"dur":0,"text":"at the moment."},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"But what you'd also see\nin the central column"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"is a list of modules that\nthis student is doing."},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"And from there, you click\nonto your module websites."},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"And I would say that if\nyou're starting as a student,"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"it's your module website that's\nmost important, because that"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"will tell you what\nto do and when."},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: OK, brilliant."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"So shall we have a look at\none of the module websites?"},"574":{"dur":0,"text":"Let's have a

worked."},"580":{"dur":0,"text":"Ta-da!"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"You'll see this is actually\nan old module website."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"It's for the 14J\npresentation of DD102."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"But this will look\nexactly the same for 16J."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"So again, you'll see this\ncentral column down the middle"},"592":{"dur":0,"text":"here."},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"And the first thing I\nwould say to students"},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"is click on the\nmodule instruction"},"597":{"dur":0,"text":"and

they"},"2449":{"dur":1,"text":"are very supportive."},"2450":{"dur":1,"text":"Another good thing to\nhear is that there's"},"2452":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of post being

this."},"2485":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm assuming\nthat students who"},"2487":{"dur":2,"text":"have chosen to study a\nmodule - I might be wrong -"},"2489":{"dur":1,"text":"have an interest\nin that subject,"},"2491":{"dur":1,"text":"and they want to\nkeep up to date."},"2492":{"dur":2,"text":"They want to find\nout what's happening,"},"2494":{"dur":1,"text":"any new publications."},"2495":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, if you have\na Twitter account,"},"2498":{"dur":3,"text":"just follow a relevant\norganisation or a relevant"},"2502":{"dur":4,"text":"person, and it's a great way\nto find out what's going on."},"2506":{"dur":3,"text":"And also, I think, using\nsocial media in this way"},"2509":{"dur":1,"text":"helps with module\nchoice as well, because"},"2511":{"dur":1,"text":"with a lot of\nsubjects, you're asked"},"2513":{"dur":2,"text":"to specialise at levels 2 and 3."},"2515":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you read\naround your subject,"},"2517":{"dur":2,"text":"you can get an idea\nof what interests you,"},"2520":{"dur":2,"text":"and that helps\nwith module choice."},"2522":{"dur":2,"text":"And also, at the\nhigher levels, you"},"2525":{"dur":2,"text":"will be required to do\nsome independent study."},"2527":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is a fantastic way to\nfind out what's being published"},"2531":{"dur":1,"text":"and any news in your\nsubject area as well."},"2533":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: So I\nguess it's really"},"2535":{"dur":2,"text":"immersing yourself, then, in\nthe things that interest you."},"2537":{"dur":3,"text":"And just when you've\ngot a few minutes spare"},"2541":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can just flick\nthrough your Facebook feed,"},"2543":{"dur":1,"text":"if you like the\nthings that are going"},"2545":{"dur":2,"text":"to support that, then you\ncan always go and find"},"2547":{"dur":1,"text":"articles, et cetera."},"2548":{"dur":2,"text":"HELEN CLOUGH: Yeah."},"2550":{"dur":3,"text":"So maybe spend a little bit\nof time finding out the key"},"2554":{"dur":1,"text":"organisations and\npeople to follow."},"2556":{"dur":1,"text":"So for example, as\na history student,"},"2558":{"dur":3,"text":"you might want to follow an\nacademic or populist magazine"},"2562":{"dur":2,"text":"like History Today,\nbecause they'll not only"},"2564":{"dur":2,"text":"tweet about their upcoming\narticles and issues,"},"2567":{"dur":2,"text":"they'll also retweet\nand link to stuff"},"2569":{"dur":2,"text":"that's relevant to history."},"2572":{"dur":3,"text":"And I also like the\nBBC Twitter feeds."},"2575":{"dur":2,"text":"They do Twitter really well."},"2578":{"dur":3,"text":"So they'll have Twitter\nfeeds for their programmes."},"2581":{"dur":4,"text":"So for example, in our time\nwith Melvyn Bragg on Radio 4,"},"2585":{"dur":2,"text":"they had their own\nTwitter feed and podcast."},"2587":{"dur":2,"text":"And they'll advertise\ntheir upcoming programmes,"},"2589":{"dur":2,"text":"but they'll also let you know\nabout lots of other things"},"2592":{"dur":2,"text":"to do with the topic\nthey're discussing."},"2594":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Excellent."},"2595":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the things I like\nabout Facebook groups"},"2597":{"dur":1,"text":"is that often they'll\nhave suggested posts."},"2599":{"dur":1,"text":"So you'll like a\nfew certain things"},"2601":{"dur":1,"text":"- I like the Tate and\nthe National Gallery,"},"2603":{"dur":1,"text":"et cetera - and then\nall of a sudden,"},"2604":{"dur":1,"text":"you'll get suggested groups."},"2605":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can naturally build up\na nice organic array of things"},"2609":{"dur":2,"text":"there to get up to speed with."},"2612":{"dur":2,"text":"So those sort of things,\nin terms of your subject,"},"2614":{"dur":1,"text":"And as you say, you don't\nnecessarily need to have them,"},"2616":{"dur":1,"text":"but they're nice\nto know about just"},"2618":{"dur":1,"text":"to support any\nknowledge, although you"},"2619":{"dur":2,"text":"don't need to often do any\nreading, especially not"},"2622":{"dur":1,"text":"early days."},"2623":{"dur":3,"text":"But in terms of employability,\nmanaging your digital presence,"},"2626":{"dur":1,"text":"as you say, is\nimportant, because people"},"2628":{"dur":3,"text":"can check up on you, and they\ncan see your feeds, et cetera."},"2631":{"dur":3,"text":"So one piece of advice that I\nthink you wanted to talk about"},"2635":{"dur":2,"text":"was about separating identities."},"2637":{"dur":1,"text":"Why is that important?"},"2639":{"dur":2,"text":"HELEN CLOUGH: Well, I mean,\nit's not for everybody,"},"2641":{"dur":1,"text":"because we're all one person."},"2642":{"dur":1,"text":"We're not separate identities."},"2644":{"dur":3,"text":"But what I do is I\nseparate out my work,"},"2647":{"dur":2,"text":"my professional identity,\nfrom my personal life."},"2649":{"dur":2,"text":"So I have two\nFacebook identities"},"2652":{"dur":2,"text":"that I created with\ndifferent

also where I log in\nto run the live Facebook"},"2664":{"dur":3,"text":"chats that we do every\ntwo or three times a year."},"2668":{"dur":1,"text":"And I do the same\nwith Twitter as well."},"2670":{"dur":3,"text":"I keep it separate\nfrom my personal life."},"2673":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's because I can\nthen control, for example,"},"2678":{"dur":2,"text":"with Twitter, I can lock\ndown my personal Twitter"},"2680":{"dur":2,"text":"account, and so\npotential employers,"},"2683":{"dur":2,"text":"they don't need to see\nthat I live tweet

group."},"2717":{"dur":0,"text":"HELEN CLOUGH:\nYeah, that's right."},"2718":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's a great\nway to do it, is just"},"2719":{"dur":1,"text":"to separate it out,\ndecide that you're"},"2721":{"dur":2,"text":"going to have just one\naccount for OU study,"},"2723":{"dur":1,"text":"and stick to that."},"2725":{"dur":3,"text":"And that can make your\nlife a lot easier, I think."},"2729":{"dur":1,"text":"And also, there\nare some tools that"},"2730":{"dur":1,"text":"can help you do this as well."},"2731":{"dur":2,"text":"So for example,\nthere's a tool that you"},"2734":{"dur":4,"text":"can use with Twitter\ncalled TweetDeck, where"},"2738":{"dur":1,"text":"it's organised into columns."},"2740":{"dur":3,"text":"So for example, in one of my\ncolumns, I have OU people,"},"2743":{"dur":1,"text":"and all the tweets\nare from OU people."},"2745":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I have another separate\ncolumn for University

then"},"2756":{"dur":3,"text":"if there's anything I want\nto follow up on, then I can."},"2760":{"dur":2,"text":"So think about having\nthese separate accounts."},"2762":{"dur":3,"text":"Think about
