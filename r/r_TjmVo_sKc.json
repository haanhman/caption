I'd recorded\na few days earlier on strategy."},"62":{"dur":3,"text":"I was just checking to see if I needed to\nmake any changes."},"65":{"dur":5,"text":"At about 7:30 my eight-year-old son,

discussions"},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"sometimes of strategy can be that way."},"101":{"dur":5,"text":"But not usually when we apply strategy to\nyou, which is what we're going to do today."},"106":{"dur":7,"text":"You know there's a simple but often overlooked\npremise in life, and that is new growth comes"},"113":{"dur":2,"text":"from new thinking."},"115":{"dur":3,"text":"New growth comes from new thinking."},"119":{"dur":5,"text":"Expecting new growth for your career, for\nyour business, for your relationships, for"},"124":{"dur":6,"text":"your finances without new ways

career."},"149":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay?"},"150":{"dur":5,"text":"And so as we do that, we're gonna talk a little\nbit about strategy overall and obviously being"},"155":{"dur":2,"text":"here at Google you understand strategy better\nthan most."},"158":{"dur":4,"text":"But we're gonna talk not just about business\nstrategy but how do you take some of those"},"162":{"dur":5,"text":"key principles of strategy, principles that\nhave been around thousands of years and actually"},"168":{"dur":7,"text":"use them to be happier, more successful however\nyou define success in your life."},"175":{"dur":7,"text":"And when we think about strategy, really what\nwe're thinking about is here is where we are"},"182":{"dur":4,"text":"today; here's where we want to go."},"187":{"dur":6,"text":"Strategy is the bridge that takes us from\nwhere we are to where we want to go."},"193":{"dur":4,"text":"So from a business standpoint, many of you\nhave goals and objectives for your plans for"},"198":{"dur":1,"text":"the year."},"199":{"dur":5,"text":"The strategy, as you know, is how you get\nfrom where you are today to reach those goals"},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"and objectives."},"206":{"dur":6,"text":"From a personal perspective strategy is looking\nat where are you right now your life?"},"212":{"dur":4,"text":"Mind, body, relationships, finances, spirituality."},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"And where do you really want to be with those\ndifferent areas?"},"220":{"dur":8,"text":"You know a lot of times we bounce around from\none thing to the next like a pinball, with"},"229":{"dur":1,"text":"no real direction."},"230":{"dur":5,"text":"And strategy, or that bridge can kind of give\nus that direction."},"236":{"dur":5,"text":"It can help channel what we're good at, what\nwe like to do, who we like to help from a"},"242":{"dur":6,"text":"profit or nonprofit perspective and we can\nfind ways to do that effectively and in ways"},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"that other people value."},"250":{"dur":5,"text":"You know great strategy is not just from a\nbusiness standpoint or a political standpoint"},"255":{"dur":7,"text":"or a military standpoint, it's designed to\nhelp us take back that power in our lives."},"263":{"dur":5,"text":"I don't know about you but often times I feel\na little bit like I don't have control."},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"Things are going in a lot of different directions,\nI'm bouncing around."},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"Strategy is a way to take some of that control\nback."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"To take some of that direction back."},"278":{"dur":6,"text":"So in 15 years, 20 years, 25 years, we can\nlook back and say you know what I did the"},"284":{"dur":3,"text":"most with what I have."},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"The biggest thing we don't want to do, and\nwhen you interview folks that are in their"},"291":{"dur":5,"text":"70s and 80s and 90s the biggest thing is folks\nlooking back with regret to say I could have"},"296":{"dur":4,"text":"maybe done this for work or I could have maybe\nbeen in this relationship or I could've maybe"},"300":{"dur":4,"text":"volunteered more often, but I didn't do it."},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"So we want to do today is talk a little bit\nabout how do we do that?"},"308":{"dur":4,"text":"How do we make sure we realize our full potential?"},"313":{"dur":6,"text":"And really as we talk today, we're gonna be\ntalking about how do you make those decisions?"},"319":{"dur":4,"text":"Just out of curiosity how many folks here,\nshow of hands, how many of you have a written"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"business plan for the group that you work\nwith?"},"326":{"dur":3,"text":"Just a show of hands, any of you guys ever\nwritten a business plan for what you do?"},"329":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, maybe about half, a third."},"334":{"dur":5,"text":"How about personally, how many folks have\na written plan, doesn't have to be a 20 page"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"plan because we know those never get used."},"342":{"dur":5,"text":"But how many folks have written down some\nof their goals professionally, personally"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"and then how you're going to get there?"},"350":{"dur":6,"text":"Okay, so good maybe about 25-30% that's actually\nmore than we normally see."},"356":{"dur":4,"text":"Because what the research shows, and I, in\nthe last couple years did research with about"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"2500 adults in the United States."},"362":{"dur":6,"text":"And what we found is that about 15% of adults\nhave a written plan for their lives."},"369":{"dur":4,"text":"So career, relationships, finances, spirituality\nabout 15%."},"374":{"dur":5,"text":"What was interesting is that we also did a\nseparate study looking at folks that worked"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"for Fortune 1000 companies."},"381":{"dur":4,"text":"So folks that were managers in Fortune 1000\ncompanies and what we found was that only"},"386":{"dur":4,"text":"22% of those folks had a written plan for\ntheir life."},"390":{"dur":5,"text":"The interesting thing is when you look at\nstrategy for business we know that historically"},"396":{"dur":4,"text":"and from a research perspective strategy is\nvery important to successful businesses."},"401":{"dur":4,"text":"There is just recently completed a 25 year\nstudy on 750 bankrupt companies."},"405":{"dur":5,"text":"And what they found was that the number one\ncause of bankruptcy over the last 25 years"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"was bad strategy."},"413":{"dur":5,"text":"So companies not having either establishes\nstrategy or working with a flawed strategy,"},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"that was the number one cause of bankruptcy."},"421":{"dur":5,"text":"And today you open up the paper, you see companies\nlike United Airlines, Borders, companies that"},"426":{"dur":4,"text":"we're very familiar with, bigger companies\nsometimes going bankrupt."},"430":{"dur":4,"text":"So we do know in business, from a business\nperspective, strategy's important."},"435":{"dur":5,"text":"From an individual perspective, as managers\npotentially, strategy is also important."},"440":{"dur":4,"text":"There were two separate studies on leadership\npublished in the Wall Street Journal and Chief"},"444":{"dur":5,"text":"Executive Magazine and both of those studies\non leadership found that the number one most"},"449":{"dur":5,"text":"valued skill in leaders today is strategic\nthinking."},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"But interestingly 50% of companies reported\nthat strategic thinking is the skill their"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"leaders most needed to improve."},"462":{"dur":5,"text":"And in the research for my previous book \"Deep\nDive\" what I found is that only about three"},"468":{"dur":5,"text":"out of every 10 managers are strategic, so\nabout 30%."},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we want to do today is say how can\nwe raise that level?"},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"How can we take what we do day in and day\nout and give it a little bit of direction?"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"None of us want to be pigeon-holed and say\nin three years you're going to do this, in"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"five years you're gonna do this, in seven\nyears you're gonna do this, right?"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"We don't want that."},"489":{"dur":4,"text":"But what we do want is to take what we're\ngood at, what we're passionate about and channel"},"494":{"dur":3,"text":"that so that we're using that as we move through."},"498":{"dur":4,"text":"What that looks like in three or four years\nyou might not know but we at least want to"},"502":{"dur":5,"text":"have that mapped out so that we're making\nprogress and we're realizing our potential,"},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"whatever that might be."},"509":{"dur":5,"text":"So as I did the research for this last book,\nwhat we found is that there's roughly 5 steps"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"to developing a strategy for your life."},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"These also tend to coincide with business,\nbusiness strategies as well."},"521":{"dur":5,"text":"But for this, instance really five steps in\ncreating that strategy for life."},"526":{"dur":10,"text":"And so the five steps are number one discover,\nsecondly differentiate, third decide, fourth"},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"design, and then fifth drive."},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we're gonna do in the next half hour\nor so is just kind of walk through each of"},"544":{"dur":5,"text":"these areas and then I would certainly like\nto open it up to any questions, comments,"},"549":{"dur":4,"text":"observations that you might have from your\nlife and maybe some the things that you found"},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"successful in driving or developing strategies\nfor yourselves."},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"So the first step is discover."},"560":{"dur":5,"text":"And discover means we've got to first understand\nwhere are we today?"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"We've got to stop and say where are we today?"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"We've got to get an idea of what does our\nsituation look like."},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's important for several reasons and\nfirst we'll talk a little bit about Katie"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"Couric."},"577":{"dur":5,"text":"Maybe not the most flattering shot of Katie,\nbut we know Katie Couric for years and years,"},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"very successful cohost of The Today Show with\nMatt Lauer."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"Year after year ranked number one."},"588":{"dur":6,"text":"About five years ago she went to the CBS evening\nnews and you can't blame her, 13-14 million"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"a year so that's incentive."},"597":{"dur":5,"text":"And each year though she was ranked dead last\nin viewership."},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"Year after year."},"603":{"dur":4,"text":"Even about 500,000 viewers behind the anchor\nwho was in the seat from CBS that nobody knew"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"before her."},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"So we wonder, well, what happened to Katie\nin that five-year time frame?"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"Did she just become a mumbling bumbling broadcaster?"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"And the answer is no."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"What happened though is her situation changed."},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"Her context changed."},"623":{"dur":5,"text":"Who she was talking to, what she was talking\nabout, the time of day she was talking about,"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"all those things changed."},"630":{"dur":5,"text":"And because her situation changed it negatively\nimpacted her performance."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"Or at least her perceived performance."},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"So one of the things we want to do is find\na way to understand what's going on in our"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"life."},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay?"},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"What's going on in our life."},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"And when you build a bridge one of the first\nthings that happens in addition to the surveying"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"things is you create a survey of the site\nright?"},"655":{"dur":4,"text":"Understand what's the composition of the ground\nlike, what's the distance we've gotta span,"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"where we going to take this bridge, what types\nof materials might be appropriate?"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"So we create that survey or snapshot of what's\nhappening."},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"So we can do that for ourselves as well, and\nmost of the things we talk about today we're"},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"gonna do visually because I think visually\n[snap] tends to connect a little bit quicker."},"677":{"dur":5,"text":"So when we look at a survey of ourselves we\ncan potentially break it down into four areas."},"682":{"dur":5,"text":"And there's other areas we can consider, but\nfour we can consider for today are mind, body,"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"relationships and finances."},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"Mind, body, relationships, finances."},"692":{"dur":5,"text":"So when it comes to mind, things that we're\nthinking about relative to potentially our"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"career, our work, our spirituality."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"The things that tend to be top of mind day\nin and day out."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"From a body perspective, what's our health\nlike?"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"Are we in good shape?"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"Do we think we need to be in better shape?"},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"Do we have a history of medical illnesses\nthat we need to be aware of?"},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"What, from a physical body perspective, are\nsome of the key things that we need to think"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"about?"},"718":{"dur":5,"text":"Relationships, family, friends, coworkers\nwhere are we at with those?"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"Are they strong across the board?"},"725":{"dur":5,"text":"Are we not spending as much time with kids\nor with friends that we're close to because"},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"works dominating?"},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"So where are the relationships at?"},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"And then finances."},"735":{"dur":5,"text":"And again as we move forward, if you have\nfamilies where are we financially?"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"Where do we want to be?"},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"Do we have a plan for getting there?"},"744":{"dur":5,"text":"So what we can do then is populate this tool\nwith kind of what's top of mind for us in"},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"each of those areas."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"So if we start with body, maybe we say you\nknow the few times that we have exercised"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"in the morning, it's really jump started our\nday."},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"So that might be a key as far as getting our\nplan set."},"760":{"dur":5,"text":"We know that when we're around the house diet's\npretty good but generally if we're traveling"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"we kind of fall off the wagon."},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"We're eating, drinking stuff that we shouldn't\nbe."},"770":{"dur":4,"text":"Relationship wise maybe we say you know I'm\nnot spending as much time with my friends"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"as I used to."},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"We've got maybe more family commitments, kids,\nthings like that."},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"But those relationships are still important,\nhow do we make sure they don't wither and"},"783":{"dur":1,"text":"die?"},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"We also might think about coworkers, you know\nmaybe we've got a new coworker; it's maybe"},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"not going great right away."},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"How do we build that relationship so that\nit becomes a stronger, more vital one to our"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"group?"},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"Financially, what are we doing long-term?"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"What are we doing from a partner or spouse\nperspective?"},"802":{"dur":4,"text":"They want to go to Europe, how do we get that\nset up so that happens?"},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"And then from a mind perspective, we're thinking\nabout work."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"What do we need to do to differentiate ourselves?"},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"To move up in the organization, maybe get\nmore responsibility?"},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"And then also are we looking for opportunities\nto volunteer?"},"819":{"dur":4,"text":"So again these are just some generic examples\nbut really what we want to do with this tool"},"824":{"dur":6,"text":"is give ourselves a way to take a snapshot\nof what's happening in our lives."},"830":{"dur":5,"text":"You've got it all kind of fluttering around\nin your mind but if you don't put it on paper"},"836":{"dur":6,"text":"it generally doesn't tend to provide that\nfoundation for the plan that we'll talk about"},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"a few minutes."},"844":{"dur":5,"text":"So once you've taken a snapshot of what's\ngoing on around you what we can then do is"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"start to think about where do we want to go?"},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"And as we know most of the time we're setting\nour goals."},"855":{"dur":5,"text":"And I developed a simple framework, I use\nthis with business managers primarily but"},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"you can also apply it to your life."},"862":{"dur":6,"text":"Goals and objective, that part of GOST, goals\nand objectives are what you're trying to achieve."},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"Strategy and tactics, how you are going to\nget there."},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"And you say well sure Rich, everybody knows\nthat."},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"Not necessarily."},"875":{"dur":6,"text":"A couple years ago, one of the CEOs of a prominent\ncompany out this way and I won't say the name"},"882":{"dur":5,"text":"came out when she first started and said,\n\"The primary strategy for our company is to"},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"grow our audience\", which is terrific."},"891":{"dur":3,"text":"But that's not a strategy, that's the goal."},"894":{"dur":2,"text":"How you grow the audience is the strategy."},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"So as you think about this in relation to\nyourself, your goals, what do you want to"},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"achieve?"},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"Whether it's work, whether it's your health,\nwhether it's relationships what specifically"},"909":{"dur":1,"text":"do you want to achieve?"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"You've got to start with a goal then the objective."},"912":{"dur":6,"text":"We've heard smart, specific, measurable, achievable,\nrelevant, time-bound, so what specifically?"},"918":{"dur":4,"text":"Strategy and tactics then is that bridge,\nhow you're going to get there."},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay so let's look at couple examples."},"925":{"dur":4,"text":"Business wise we might have one that says\nour goal is to win a quarterly sales contest"},"929":{"dur":1,"text":"for our region."},"931":{"dur":6,"text":"The objective then more specifically what\nwe want to achieve, 200,000, 250,000 in sales"},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"by the end of the third quarter."},"939":{"dur":3,"text":"Strategy, then, how generally are we going\nto get there?"},"942":{"dur":4,"text":"Focus our selling efforts on expanding share\nof wallet with current customers."},"947":{"dur":4,"text":"And then tactically we might do a cell sheet,\nvideo of customers using the products and"},"951":{"dur":1,"text":"so forth."},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"How do we apply that then into our personal\nlives?"},"955":{"dur":2,"text":"The goal might be to lose weight."},"957":{"dur":3,"text":"We're just getting through the winter, I'm\nfrom Chicago, we tend to eat a lot of stuffed"},"961":{"dur":1,"text":"pizza in the winter."},"962":{"dur":1,"text":"So the goal might be to lose some weight."},"964":{"dur":5,"text":"The objective more specifically is lose 15\npounds in six months."},"969":{"dur":6,"text":"The strategy then, how generally are we going\nto do it is to eliminate weight causing behaviors"},"976":{"dur":1,"text":"and create healthy habits."},"977":{"dur":5,"text":"So tactically, specifically, we might do things\nlike try to drink more water as opposed to"},"983":{"dur":1,"text":"those two or three sodas a day."},"984":{"dur":4,"text":"Get a treadmill, get some strength bands,\neat protein-based breakfasts, do some of those"},"989":{"dur":1,"text":"things."},"990":{"dur":4,"text":"So again, many of you it sounded like are\ndoing this already but we've got to be able"},"995":{"dur":4,"text":"to jot down the goal of what we're trying\nto achieve the objective the strategy and"},"1000":{"dur":2,"text":"the tactic, OK?"},"1002":{"dur":5,"text":"So again we don't have a lot of time today\nbut one of the exercises I'd recommend is"},"1007":{"dur":5,"text":"take a few minutes, think about your work,\nthink about your relationships, think about"},"1013":{"dur":2,"text":"your finances, what are some of the goals?"},"1016":{"dur":7,"text":"And what are the strategies you going to use\nto get there, OK?"},"1024":{"dur":7,"text":"About 1974 or I think it was roughly August\n7th, a Frenchman by the name of Phillippe"},"1032":{"dur":6,"text":"Petit did something that no one had done before\nand no one has done since."},"1039":{"dur":5,"text":"He set up a wire, a 450 pound cable between\nthe twin towers of the World Trade Center"},"1045":{"dur":9,"text":"and for about an hour he walked on that high\nwire 1350 feet above the streets of Manhattan."},"1054":{"dur":8,"text":"Jumping, dancing, laying down, no harness,\nno safety wire, nothing for about an hour."},"1063":{"dur":5,"text":"And then finally was pulled off by the police\nas it started to rain."},"1068":{"dur":4,"text":"So we look at that and we say very interesting,\nit was actually called the artistic crime"},"1073":{"dur":1,"text":"of the century."},"1074":{"dur":5,"text":"And there's a great documentary called 'Man\non Wire' and it won the 2008 Academy Award"},"1079":{"dur":3,"text":"for best documentary if you haven't been seen\nit it's fairly interesting."},"1083":{"dur":2,"text":"And it documents what he did."},"1086":{"dur":4,"text":"And some say, well you know it was just kind\nof a spur of the moment, a whim, a lark and"},"1091":{"dur":6,"text":"actually that moment had been preceded by\nsix years of him planning with a group of"},"1097":{"dur":5,"text":"about 10 people in order to be able to set\nthis up and do it."},"1102":{"dur":7,"text":"So at the end of the day, he took what's obviously\na very common activity which is walking and"},"1110":{"dur":5,"text":"he did it in a way that the people who've\nseen it or seen the documentary will never"},"1115":{"dur":1,"text":"forget."},"1116":{"dur":5,"text":"So he took a common activity and he made it\nhis own through his unique talent and his"},"1122":{"dur":1,"text":"unique passion."},"1124":{"dur":5,"text":"And any time you develop strategy for your\ncareer, for your business inherently there's"},"1129":{"dur":2,"text":"going to be risk."},"1132":{"dur":6,"text":"If you're comfortable every day and everything\nthat you do you're probably not really maximizing"},"1139":{"dur":1,"text":"your potential."},"1141":{"dur":2,"text":"Great strategy demands that you take risks."},"1144":{"dur":5,"text":"Reed Hastings who, as many of you know I'm\nsure, is the CEO of Netflix has said, \"If"},"1149":{"dur":6,"text":"you don't feel pain when you're developing\nstrategy then you have not developed strategy.\""},"1156":{"dur":3,"text":"So one of the

don't?"},"1169":{"dur":7,"text":"And how have you, in the past, used those\nto bring value to yourself and to other people"},"1176":{"dur":2,"text":"around you."},"1179":{"dur":3,"text":"So the second step in our process is differentiate."},"1182":{"dur":6,"text":"You know when you look at most great companies\nyou can very quickly understand how they differentiate"},"1189":{"dur":4,"text":"themselves from the other companies they compete\nwith in order to be successful."},"1193":{"dur":4,"text":"You know a company like yours obviously you've\ndriven a lot of your differentiation around"},"1198":{"dur":6,"text":"this idea of play from a culture perspective\nbecause play leads to innovation which leads"},"1204":{"dur":2,"text":"to new value for customers."},"1207":{"dur":2,"text":"So what I want you to think about is how do\nwe differentiate."},"1210":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll give you a couple more examples."},"1212":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a British artist name Damien Hirst."},"1215":{"dur":7,"text":"And Damien Hirst has become a very popular,\nmaybe infamous in some circles, artist because"},"1223":{"dur":4,"text":"what he's done is he's taken art and he's\ndone it very differently than most anyone"},"1228":{"dur":1,"text":"else out there in the world."},"1229":{"dur":6,"text":"What he started to do, or what he's been doing\nis taking animals, dead animals, okay, I'm"},"1235":{"dur":3,"text":"not a part of PETA, and if you are please\ndirect comments to Damien."},"1238":{"dur":5,"text":"But he's been taking dead animals and putting\nthem in formaldehyde and using them in different"},"1244":{"dur":5,"text":"ways, different positions, different forms\nto create artwork."},"1249":{"dur":3,"text":"This is one of his most famous pieces."},"1252":{"dur":3,"text":"Now we can argue all day is that art or is\nit not art?"},"1256":{"dur":5,"text":"And I'm not gonna say which side I fall on,\nbut the reality is, by doing art in a different"},"1261":{"dur":10,"text":"way, a way that's meaningful to him, he's\nbecome the most wealthy British living artist."},"1272":{"dur":2,"text":"His net worth is about $350 million."},"1275":{"dur":4,"text":"So again were not saying that's the be-all\nend-all of art, but the reality is he's one"},"1280":{"dur":4,"text":"example of an artist whose done things differently\nto be successful."},"1284":{"dur":3,"text":"You look at an entertainer like Johnny Cash."},"1288":{"dur":3,"text":"We know Johnny Cash, American singer-songwriter."},"1291":{"dur":6,"text":"When you listen to his recordings never the\nbest voice really, but what made him successful,"},"1298":{"dur":7,"text":"what made him endeared to many people is his\nability to tell a true authentic story in"},"1305":{"dur":3,"text":"a way that resonated with people."},"1309":{"dur":5,"text":"Another example of doing things differently,\nI'm from Chicago and there's a restaurant"},"1314":{"dur":7,"text":"in Chicago called Alinea, and the chef there\nis a person by the name of Grant Achatz."},"1322":{"dur":7,"text":"Grant Achatz, in 2008, was named the number\none chef in the United States and last year"},"1329":{"dur":5,"text":"his restaurant, Alinea, was named the number\none restaurant in North America by restaurant"},"1334":{"dur":1,"text":"magazine."},"1335":{"dur":6,"text":"So you say, wow a very successful person,\nhe's also overcome cancer in this whole process"},"1342":{"dur":3,"text":"which has been a testament to his character."},"1345":{"dur":1,"text":"So how do you top that?"},"1347":{"dur":4,"text":"So what he decided to do was a completely\ndifferent concept when it comes to restaurants"},"1352":{"dur":2,"text":"for his next restaurant."},"1354":{"dur":2,"text":"His new restaurant is called Next."},"1357":{"dur":3,"text":"And Next, what they do is they have four menus\nfor the year."},"1361":{"dur":5,"text":"Each of the menu's represents a different\ntime and a different place in history."},"1366":{"dur":8,"text":"So Paris 1906 or Sicily 1949 or Hong Kong\n2036."},"1374":{"dur":3,"text":"And for three months, that's the menu."},"1378":{"dur":3,"text":"You don't make a reservation, you have to\nbuy tickets."},"1381":{"dur":4,"text":"Ticket prices differ based on the week of\nthe day and the time of the day."},"1385":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you want tickets for Wednesday night\nat nine o'clock, they're gonna be less expensive"},"1390":{"dur":2,"text":"than Saturday night at seven o'clock."},"1393":{"dur":2,"text":"All of the cost is included within that ticket."},"1396":{"dur":4,"text":"So when you go, you're not tipping anyone,\nyou're not paying extra for drinks, everything's"},"1401":{"dur":1,"text":"included."},"1402":{"dur":5,"text":"You can also get a subscription so that you\ncan have tickets for each of the four."},"1407":{"dur":5,"text":"So again we think about dining, restaurants,\nvery similar activities but Grant has done"},"1413":{"dur":5,"text":"it in a different way that's helped him stand\nout amongst his peers."},"1418":{"dur":5,"text":"So I'd like you to think about and if you\nhave a pen and paper maybe jot down, but think"},"1423":{"dur":8,"text":"about what are some of the unique traits,\nactivities, skills that you have that you"},"1432":{"dur":5,"text":"are able to bring value to yourself or other\npeople in your life?"},"1438":{"dur":1,"text":"What makes you unique?"},"1439":{"dur":3,"text":"Your talent, your passion, okay?"},"1443":{"dur":5,"text":"So think about that as you move forward."},"1448":{"dur":1,"text":"Several years ago my wife."},"1449":{"dur":1,"text":"Anne, and I went on a safari in Africa."},"1451":{"dur":3,"text":"And we took a tour of a Masai Mara tribal\nvillage led by a native

been to Africa, some of the places,\nthe huts, the houses they live in are actually"},"1473":{"dur":2,"text":"made of dried cow dung which is interesting."},"1475":{"dur":4,"text":"Anyway, were finishing up the tour and the\ntribal leader, the one with seven wives emerges"},"1480":{"dur":3,"text":"from his hut and begins talking with some\nof the tourists."},"1483":{"dur":5,"text":"As we're about to leave, I notice the tribal\nleader talking to my wife, Anne."},"1488":{"dur":4,"text":"So being the interested husband I kind of\nwandered over to eavesdrop on the end of the"},"1492":{"dur":1,"text":"conversation."},"1493":{"dur":6,"text":"He said to her, \"We have much work to do here\nbut our lives are simple and good."},"1500":{"dur":4,"text":"I am always looking

to my wife, Anne, I think\nbeing called sturdy in Africa is a complement"},"1514":{"dur":2,"text":"to women I'm not so sure it would be here."},"1517":{"dur":4,"text":"[Laughter]\nSo after a long pause by Anne, a little too"},"1521":{"dur":1,"text":"long for my liking,\n[Laughter]"},"1523":{"dur":5,"text":"she said, \"You know, I love the land here,\nand the animals are beautiful but seeing as"},"1528":{"dur":2,"text":"how I'm already married all respectfully have\nto pass.\""},"1531":{"dur":4,"text":"So on the bouncy Jeep ride back to camp I\ncouldn't let that conversation go without"},"1535":{"dur":1,"text":"just a little jab."},"1537":{"dur":4,"text":"So I said, \"You know, honey, it sounds like\nyour decision earlier boiled down to me or"},"1541":{"dur":1,"text":"a house of cow dung.\""},"1542":{"dur":2,"text":"And she said, \"Yes and it was much closer\nthan you think.\""},"1545":{"dur":3,"text":"[Laughter]\nBecause the reality is in business and our"},"1549":{"dur":5,"text":"personal lives we're constantly faced with\ntrade-offs."},"1554":{"dur":2,"text":"Trade-offs involve incompatible activities."},"1557":{"dur":3,"text":"More of one thing means less of another."},"1560":{"dur":4,"text":"And inherently, when we make trade-offs we're\nmaking decisions."},"1564":{"dur":3,"text":"So step three of our process is decide."},"1568":{"dur":5,"text":"And the word decide or decision comes from\nthe Latin word decidere which means to cut"},"1573":{"dur":1,"text":"off."},"1574":{"dur":4,"text":"If you have trees on

often do we stop and actively,"},"1599":{"dur":3,"text":"consciously take things off of our plate?"},"1603":{"dur":3,"text":"Especially from a work standpoint I see it\nvery often."},"1606":{"dur":3,"text":"You're adding more projects, you're adding\nmore work because you want to be that team"},"1610":{"dur":5,"text":"player and all the sudden your spread too\nthin and you're not as valuable to your team"},"1616":{"dur":5,"text":"or the business unit as you could be because\nthere is no focus."},"1621":{"dur":3,"text":"The same thing happens with our

thin."},"1643":{"dur":5,"text":"So we want to understand how can we focus\na little bit more on what's really valuable"},"1648":{"dur":5,"text":"to us and the people that we care about at\nwork and at home?"},"1653":{"dur":4,"text":"And one of the ways to do that is to come\nup with a not to do list."},"1658":{"dur":2,"text":"And this isn't a revolutionary concept."},"1661":{"dur":7,"text":"But what I have found is I do leadership programs\non strategic thinking with managers around"},"1668":{"dur":1,"text":"the world."},"1670":{"dur":5,"text":"What I've found is that the great managers\nor leaders are the ones that are crystal clear"},"1675":{"dur":4,"text":"on what they and their teams are not going\nto do."},"1680":{"dur":5,"text":"Everybody has a to do list but the great leaders\nare the ones that are crystal clear on what"},"1686":{"dur":3,"text":"they're not going to do."},"1689":{"dur":2,"text":"So that comes to our personal lives as well."},"1692":{"dur":4,"text":"We have to make those trade-offs otherwise\nthey get made for you."},"1696":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"1697":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's when we feel like we don't really\nhave control of what's going on, we feel like"},"1701":{"dur":1,"text":"we're spread too thin."},"1703":{"dur":3,"text":"So one of the things you may consider doing\nis a not to do list."},"1707":{"dur":4,"text":"Look at those areas that we talked about,\nlook at work, what are some of the activities,"},"1711":{"dur":4,"text":"the projects, the reports, the tactics that\nyou think you should stop doing?"},"1716":{"dur":2,"text":"Because they're no longer bringing value."},"1719":{"dur":4,"text":"Think about your personal life, from a financial\nperspective what are areas that you're spending"},"1723":{"dur":5,"text":"money that aren't really adding value long-term\nto you or the people that you care about?"},"1729":{"dur":5,"text":"So think about that not to do list that's\npotentially a way to creating greater focus"},"1734":{"dur":6,"text":"not only at work but in your personal lives\nas well."},"1741":{"dur":5,"text":"When you create a house, when you create a\nbuilding, when you create a bridge generally"},"1746":{"dur":2,"text":"you start with a blueprint, right?"},"1749":{"dur":5,"text":"If you are gonna have a new house built and\nyou talk to the

said, \"We don't have a\nblueprint\", you'd think, \u201coh my God what"},"1763":{"dur":1,"text":"do you mean we don't have a blueprint?"},"1765":{"dur":3,"text":"How do we know what were actually

that"},"1775":{"dur":1,"text":"blueprint."},"1777":{"dur":3,"text":"And so design is that fourth step."},"1780":{"dur":5,"text":"Once you've kind of discovered where you are\nstep one, you've differentiated in step two"},"1786":{"dur":5,"text":"and thought about what are you're unique talents\nand passions and how do you bring those together."},"1791":{"dur":5,"text":"And in step three you've decided where am\nI going to focus my time, my talent, and any"},"1796":{"dur":3,"text":"finances to be happy, to be successful?"},"1800":{"dur":2,"text":"Now we get to design."},"1802":{"dur":2,"text":"Design means we need to layout that plan."},"1804":{"dur":5,"text":"And planning in a lot of places has negative\nbaggage with it."},"1810":{"dur":4,"text":"Well we develop a plan but it sits in a binder\non the shelf."},"1814":{"dur":5,"text":"How many of you actively use your business\nplans at work day in and day out to drive"},"1820":{"dur":1,"text":"your activities?"},"1821":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, a couple people."},"1826":{"dur":5,"text":"A lot of the Fortune 500 companies that I\ndo work with this is kind of the scenario."},"1831":{"dur":6,"text":"They have a plan, it sits in a binder, sits\nin a PowerPoint deck."},"1837":{"dur":4,"text":"Here's what they do day in and day out and\nthere's no link."},"1842":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no link."},"1843":{"dur":5,"text":"So what we want to do is try and create that\nlink between what is the plan that we have"},"1849":{"dur":2,"text":"and what are we doing day in and day out."},"1851":{"dur":5,"text":"And so one of the more common planning tools\nthat's out there is SWOT analysis and I know"},"1857":{"dur":4,"text":"SWOT analysis is the most commonly used strategic\nplanning tool in the world but in my opinion"},"1861":{"dur":2,"text":"it's probably the most misused."},"1863":{"dur":4,"text":"Because we've seen SWOT analysis, strengths,\nweaknesses, opportunities, threats."},"1868":{"dur":2,"text":"We say yeah, yeah, yeah, been there done that."},"1871":{"dur":4,"text":"But if we do it correctly we can generate\nsome insights and help start at least the"},"1875":{"dur":1,"text":"foundation of that plan."},"1877":{"dur":3,"text":"And what I want to share with you today is\nnot just SWOT but what would you do after"},"1881":{"dur":3,"text":"a SWOT analysis to actually develop strategy\nfor your life."},"1884":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll show you a quick example."},"1887":{"dur":4,"text":"Here's a SWOT example that you might have,\nstrengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats."},"1892":{"dur":6,"text":"Strengths, coaching, maybe you do some volunteer\nwork with your daughter's ice-skating team"},"1898":{"dur":1,"text":"or your son's baseball team."},"1900":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe you like to coach maybe you're good\nat that."},"1902":{"dur":3,"text":"Maybe you're a leader at school, there's a\nparent teacher organization and you do a lot"},"1906":{"dur":1,"text":"of good work with that."},"1908":{"dur":3,"text":"Maybe you have fund-raising abilities, maybe\nyou're working with a couple nonprofits and"},"1911":{"dur":5,"text":"obviously as the economy has been poorer it's\ndifficult for nonprofits to survive so you've"},"1917":{"dur":3,"text":"used some of your fund-raising abilities that's\na strength."},"1920":{"dur":2,"text":"Weaknesses maybe we're not as good a listener\nas we could be."},"1923":{"dur":4,"text":"Maybe we've been in a relationship for a long\ntime and we're not really locked in and listening"},"1928":{"dur":4,"text":"to what our partner or spouse or significant\nother is saying."},"1932":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe we're too quick to judge folks."},"1934":{"dur":5,"text":"A lot of times we look at somebody and you\ntake 10 seconds and you say I know what that"},"1940":{"dur":1,"text":"person's about."},"1942":{"dur":2,"text":"So maybe we need to step back a little bit\nthere."},"1945":{"dur":4,"text":"Maybe we're not fully engaged with family\nat home, maybe work's taking over, e-mail,"},"1949":{"dur":1,"text":"texting, Twitter."},"1950":{"dur":4,"text":"Maybe we're doing a lot of that stuff and\nwe're not fully engaged when we're home."},"1955":{"dur":4,"text":"Opportunities, maybe the formation of a new\nnonprofit group, training for new managers"},"1959":{"dur":5,"text":"at work, maybe there's an executive-led manager-led\nclass that we could be a part of."},"1964":{"dur":3,"text":"And then maybe our daughter's interest in\nart is an opportunity for us."},"1968":{"dur":3,"text":"Threats, maybe there's some company downsizing."},"1972":{"dur":1,"text":"Community's lack of participation."},"1974":{"dur":4,"text":"Maybe people aren't reaching out and helping\nas much as they used to with community events."},"1978":{"dur":4,"text":"And then maybe there's a property tax increase\nthat financially we need to think about because"},"1983":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe that affects some of our vacation plans."},"1985":{"dur":5,"text":"So what we can do then is once we developed\na SWOT analysis we can say how do we prioritize"},"1991":{"dur":2,"text":"the opportunities that we have?"},"1993":{"dur":4,"text":"You all have time, talent and finances to\nsome degree."},"1998":{"dur":2,"text":"How do you prioritize where that goes?"},"2001":{"dur":4,"text":"You can use an opportunity matrix to do that\nlooking at two criteria."},"2005":{"dur":2,"text":"What's the probability of achievement?"},"2008":{"dur":3,"text":"If I put my resources, my time, my talent,\nmy budget to that?"},"2011":{"dur":2,"text":"And then what's the impact on my life if I\ndo?"},"2014":{"dur":5,"text":"Very common tool that we use in business to\nvet opportunities when you can use it in your"},"2020":{"dur":1,"text":"personal life as well."},"2021":{"dur":4,"text":"So maybe when we plot our opportunities, we\nsay well the formation of the nonprofit group"},"2026":{"dur":3,"text":"the probability is not as high because that's\ndependent on a lot of other people and we're"},"2030":{"dur":3,"text":"having difficulty getting people involved."},"2033":{"dur":3,"text":"Training for new managers, maybe the probability\nof the impact is a little higher there."},"2037":{"dur":1,"text":"We've got good relationships at work."},"2039":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a need at work so maybe we can do\nthat."},"2041":{"dur":4,"text":"And then maybe the number one opportunity\nis Suzy's interest in art."},"2046":{"dur":3,"text":"She's our daughter, we're maybe not spending\nas much time at home."},"2049":{"dur":5,"text":"The impact could be great if we could find\nout a way to be involved with that."},"2055":{"dur":3,"text":"Same thing with the threats that we face and\nagain threats are things that potentially"},"2058":{"dur":4,"text":"can stop us from reaching our level of happiness\nor success."},"2063":{"dur":5,"text":"What's the probability that that would occur\n1 to 10, what's the impact on our lives?"},"2068":{"dur":5,"text":"So again community's lack of participation,\nprobability is high the impact maybe not as"},"2073":{"dur":1,"text":"much on us."},"2074":{"dur":4,"text":"The property tax increase something that we're\nthinking about, the company layoffs again"},"2078":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe the biggest thing that kind of is top\nof mind."},"2082":{"dur":4,"text":"So now you say, 'okay great Rich we did the\nSWOT analysis, we prioritize our opportunities"},"2087":{"dur":2,"text":"and threats so what?'"},"2089":{"dur":3,"text":"That's the biggest question I get when I do\nstrategic planning with companies is we did"},"2093":{"dur":2,"text":"SWOT analysis, so what?"},"2096":{"dur":1,"text":"Who cares?"},"2098":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't do anything with it."},"2100":{"dur":5,"text":"So this last tool is a way to take your SWOT\nanalysis, your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,"},"2106":{"dur":3,"text":"and threats and actually create strategies."},"2109":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay?"},"2110":{"dur":5,"text":"I know this is a little busy but what you've\ndone is you have your strengths and weaknesses"},"2116":{"dur":1,"text":"at the top."},"2117":{"dur":2,"text":"You already did that as part of your SWOT\nanalysis."},"2120":{"dur":3,"text":"You have your opportunities and threats listed\non the left-hand side."},"2123":{"dur":3,"text":"You've already created those in your SWOT\nanalysis."},"2127":{"dur":6,"text":"All you're doing now is you're playing around\nwith the combination of your strengths and"},"2133":{"dur":6,"text":"weaknesses which are your internal capabilities,\nrelative to your opportunities and threats"},"2140":{"dur":2,"text":"which are your external possibilities."},"2143":{"dur":5,"text":"So we can see if we look at our strengths\nand opportunities we have leadership ability"},"2148":{"dur":4,"text":"at school, coaching, maybe we haven't really\nused that at work."},"2153":{"dur":5,"text":"So one of the opportunities is to use that\nleadership ability to create a proposal to"},"2158":{"dur":4,"text":"lead one of those managerial classes at work."},"2163":{"dur":3,"text":"If we drop down and look at strengths and\nthreats."},"2167":{"dur":4,"text":"One of the strengths that we have is fund-raising\nabilities so maybe we create a fund-raising"},"2171":{"dur":4,"text":"event for the community to generate greater\ninterest because that's a threat, the community's"},"2176":{"dur":3,"text":"lack of interest to help needy children."},"2180":{"dur":5,"text":"So again if you do SWOT analysis as part of\nyour work or part of your life, this is a"},"2186":{"dur":5,"text":"way for you to line those things up to create\nsome strategies."},"2191":{"dur":6,"text":"To create some direction for how you're using\nyour time and your talent."},"2198":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay?"},"2199":{"dur":4,"text":"So the last step, the fifth step is drive."},"2204":{"dur":3,"text":"When we think about the word drive, it could\nhave a lot of different connotations."},"2208":{"dur":5,"text":"A very leisurely Sunday drive, maybe in the\nmountains just relaxing."},"2214":{"dur":6,"text":"Maybe you're thinking more of a Formula One\nrace car or NASCAR trading paint."},"2220":{"dur":5,"text":"But the word drive really talks about, really\nmeans to put effort forth."},"2226":{"dur":3,"text":"To move something from one spot to another."},"2229":{"dur":4,"text":"We can do all the thinking, we can do all\nthe planning we want but at the end of the"},"2234":{"dur":7,"text":"day if we don't have the preparation and the\nperseverance and the will to move things forward"},"2242":{"dur":1,"text":"then we've wasted time."},"2243":{"dur":4,"text":"I work with a lot of organizations when I\nlook at how they've done planning in the past,"},"2248":{"dur":1,"text":"there's no drive."},"2250":{"dur":5,"text":"They've spent the time in the two-day off-site\nmeeting at the Holiday Inn twice a year but"},"2255":{"dur":3,"text":"when it comes to executing, they're not executing."},"2259":{"dur":5,"text":"So we want to talk a little bit about what's\na way, what's a tool for us to drive success"},"2265":{"dur":3,"text":"in our personal lives and potentially at work."},"2268":{"dur":4,"text":"And the tool that we could potentially use\nis called an activity system map."},"2273":{"dur":5,"text":"An activity system map is simply a way to\nlook at your life, to look at your business"},"2279":{"dur":2,"text":"on one page, one page."},"2281":{"dur":6,"text":"And there's really two components, the first\ncomponent is your strategic themes."},"2288":{"dur":8,"text":"Your strategic themes are the 3 to 5 areas\nthat really you want to invest the most resources"},"2297":{"dur":4,"text":"in to provide that value to yourself, to the\nother people in your life."},"2301":{"dur":6,"text":"So 3 to 5 areas that really you want to focus\non this year to reach your potential."},"2308":{"dur":2,"text":"The tactics then, are the second part."},"2311":{"dur":5,"text":"The tactics are activities are the things\nthat you're actually going to do to realize"},"2317":{"dur":1,"text":"those strategies."},"2318":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's look at an example."},"2321":{"dur":7,"text":"Our strategic themes might be empathy, teaching\nand growth, as we look at our plan for 2012"},"2329":{"dur":1,"text":"on an individual level."},"2331":{"dur":3,"text":"Empathy, teaching and growth those are our\nthree strategic
