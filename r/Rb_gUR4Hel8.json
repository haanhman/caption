outline most of the features you&#39;ll find on a whole range of winter wetsuits"},"77.00":{"start":"77","dur":"5","text":"And then we&#39;re going to go through specifics of just these wetsuits which are perfect for really, really cold water."},"82.00":{"start":"82","dur":"3","text":"So one of the most important things about choosing a winter wetsuit is the fit,"},"85.00":{"start":"85","dur":"7","text":"and each brand does come up slightly differently, so we&#39;ve got a really good size chart on the magicseaweed

you&#39;ll find on a lot of these winter wetsuits and the non hooded versions as well"},"119.00":{"start":"119","text":"The first thing to note is the neoprene&#39;s stretchiness, now pretty much every modern wetsuit that we stock is going to have fully super flex neoprene"},"129.00":{"start":"129","dur":"6","text":"You&#39;re going to see a lot of brand names and trade marks from different brands calling it different things"},"135.00":{"start":"135","dur":"9","text":"Off the top of my head there&#39;s ultrastretch, there&#39;s E3 neoprene from Rip Curl, but essentially it means really, really stretchy neoprene"},"144.00":{"start":"144","dur":"5","text":"and if you haven&#39;t had a new wetsuit in the last, probably, three seasons then you&#39;ll notice a huge difference,"},"149.00":{"start":"149","dur":"4","text":"it&#39;s more comfortable, it&#39;s more flexible, everything about it is better pretty much"},"153.00":{"start":"153","dur":"7","text":"combined with some of the other features I&#39;m about to go through it&#39;s more flexible and warmer than anything you will have experienced before"},"160.00":{"start":"160","dur":"8","text":"The other feature which is common to nearly all these wetsuits is the stitching, it&#39;s glued and blind stitched"},"168.00":{"start":"168","dur":"8","text":"so you&#39;re probably familiar with this, they basically glue the seams together, butt the two bits of neoprene together, glue along that seam"},"176.00":{"start":"176","text":"then they stitch it, not all the way through the neoprene from the outside to the inside, but halfway through, over the seam so it&#39;s locked together"},"184.00":{"start":"184","dur":"5","text":"but it doesn&#39;t go all the way through, what that does is stop the water coming through from the outside of the wetsuit to the inside"},"189.00":{"start":"189","dur":"44","text":"which is what you don&#39;t want to happen, you want the cold water to stay outside the wetsuit so that&#39;s why the blind-stitching is used"},"196.00":{"start":"196","dur":"5","text":"So this Rip Curl Flash Bomb Plus wetsuit for instance, you can see that stitching on the arms, but that doesn&#39;t go all the way through"},"201.00":{"start":"201","dur":"7","text":"There are some wetsuits which I will mention later that don&#39;t have any stitching at all which is a bit of an innovation this season which I&#39;m sure we&#39;re going to see more of"},"208.00":{"start":"208","dur":"8","text":"The other thing which we&#39;ll see on nearly all these wetsuits is &quot;single lined&quot; neoprene, here&#39;s a good example"},"216.00":{"start":"216","dur":"11","text":"This is a Roxy Cypher hooded wetsuit, on the hood here it&#39;s got a rubberised texture on the outside, so it&#39;s lined on the inside"},"235.00":{"start":"235","dur":"7","text":"On the outside, where you don&#39;t need it to be durable, again this is surf specific so you don&#39;t need any durability on the hood,"},"242.00":{"start":"242","dur":"8","text":"it&#39;s not going to come into contact with anything if you&#39;re lucky, but what that does is, without the lining on the outside the water can&#39;t soak in, so it just sheets straight off,"},"250.00":{"start":"250","dur":"9","text":"it won&#39;t stay on the outside, it won&#39;t soak in like it will on a lined wetsuit, with double lined neoprene on the rest of the wetsuit, so that&#39;s a huge benefit in terms of warmth"},"259.00":{"start":"259","dur":"4","text":"none of the water stays in there so you don&#39;t lose any of that heat when it evaporates off"},"263.00":{"start":"263","dur":"9","text":"another thing you&#39;re going to find on nearly all these wetsuits is polypro lining, this is fluffy,"},"272.00":{"start":"272","dur":"12","text":"here&#39;s Rip Curls Flash Bomb lining, and this is C-Skins, similar sort of stuff, Flash bomb go a bit out of the ordinary with theirs, it&#39;s very thick"},"284.00":{"start":"284","dur":"8","text":"The C-Skins is more like your standard polypro lining, normally they will put this on the areas which don&#39;t need as much flexibility"},"292.00":{"start":"292","dur":"4","text":"like the chest, the hood is obviously a great area to put it on"},"296.00":{"start":"296","dur":"7","text":"what this does is trap a layer of air, air is the best insulator you can get, any air trapped there is always good news"},"303.00":{"start":"303","dur":"11","text":"it&#39;s going to stop the heat getting out, it also wicks water away from the body, a bit like a wool underlayer would, if you&#39;re in a cold climate and you wear that base layer"},"314.00":{"start":"314","dur":"5","text":"so it&#39;s doing the same thing as a base layer, it sucks the water away from your skin keeping you a bit warmer"},"319.00":{"start":"319","dur":"2","text":"traps a layer of air so it insulates you and traps the warmth inside the wetsuit"},"321.00":{"start":"321","dur":"6","text":"you&#39;re going to find that on nearly all the wetsuits, I will go through in detail how thick it is and how much of it there is a bit later on"},"327.00":{"start":"327","dur":"9","text":"the next thing is how the manufacturers seal the wetsuits, it can be a little bit different so I will go through it individually a little bit later on"},"336.00":{"start":"336","dur":"5","text":"but essentially, here&#39;s a Rip Curl Flash Bomb, there&#39;s no sealing on the outside, you can see the stitching, as I said, it doesn&#39;t go all the way through"},"341.00":{"start":"341","dur":"7","text":"but you can see the stitching exposed on the outside, you&#39;ll see this on the inside of some wetsuits, it depends how the manufacturer wants to do it"},"348.00":{"start":"348","dur":"8","text":"Rip Curl use Tape on the inside, that&#39;s their E3 plus tape, you&#39;ll find a similar thing on Xcel wetsuits, that&#39;s taped on the inside"},"356.00":{"start":"356","dur":"9","text":"here&#39;s a C-Skins, that&#39;s got liquid seal on the outside, it&#39;s quite a wide liquid seal on the C-Skins in particular"},"365.00":{"start":"365","dur":"9","text":"and then you can see the exposed stitching on the inside, so essentially any sort of liquid seal like this is going to be a little bit less flexible than having"},"374.00":{"start":"374","dur":"11","text":"either exposed stitching, or a very thin bead of rubber, or even tape, slightly, tape and this sort of liquid seal I think is roughly the same sort of stretchiness"},"385.00":{"start":"385","dur":"8","text":"but it will keep the water out, that&#39;s the idea, any water that might have got through these seams is not going to get through that liquid seal"},"393.00":{"start":"393","dur":"6","text":"In some cases you&#39;ll find it on both sides and I will highlight that in a little while when I get to those wetsuits"},"399.00":{"start":"399","dur":"15","text":"the other thing with hooded wetsuits, they&#39;re all front zip wetsuits, obviously having a permanently attached hood you can&#39;t really do it with a back-zip, the zip would have to go all the way up through the hood"},"414.00":{"start":"414","dur":"7","text":"so it&#39;s not going to happen, but front zip wetsuits have really come in in a big way in the last few seasons, if you haven&#39;t had one before it might take a little bit of getting used to"},"421.00":{"start":"421","dur":"9","text":"to get in and out but after two or three times I think you&#39;ll find it goes off and on smoothly so don&#39;t be afraid of going for a front zip wetsuit"},"430.00":{"start":"430","dur":"3","text":"if it&#39;s a good fit for you then you should be able to get in and out no problem"},"433.00":{"start":"433","dur":"5","text":"so all of them are front zip wetsuits, there&#39;s slight differences in the zips which I will go through if it&#39;s relevant a bit later on"},"438.00":{"start":"438","dur":"7","text":"and obviously permanently attached hoods on all these wetsuits, you can&#39;t take them off, as I said though you do get non-hooded versions"},"445.00":{"start":"445","dur":"6","text":"so you can get the non-hooded wetsuit with all the same technology and features which doesn&#39;t have the permanently attached hood"},"451.00":{"start":"451","dur":"8","text":"they are perhaps a little more versatile if you&#39;re in warmer waters but this video is really focussing on really cold water,"},"459.00":{"start":"459","dur":"4","text":"where we want a permanently attached hood to stop any water getting in through that neck area at all"},"465.00":{"start":"465","dur":"7","text":"So that&#39;s pretty much all the common features on these wetsuits and the other winter wetsuits that we stock, whether they&#39;re hooded or not"},"472.00":{"start":"472","dur":"8","text":"so I&#39;m going to go through a few of the specifics before we get down to which one is going to be the warmest wetsuit for you when you&#39;re surfing in cold water"},"484.00":{"start":"484","dur":"15","text":"So we&#39;ll go in alphabetical order, we&#39;ve got the Billabong SG5 7\/6\/5 wetsuit, the 7\/6\/5 is rating the thickness of the neoprene"},"499.00":{"start":"499","dur":"12","text":"in various areas, on various panels of the wetsuit, what you&#39;ll find is that it relates to the thickness of the actual neoprene foam rather than the full effective thickness that you get from the wetsuit"},"511.00":{"start":"511","dur":"12","text":"On that count, we have measured all these wetsuits with these callipers, these are super sensitive, these will measure fractions of a millimetre"},"523.00":{"start":"523","dur":"9","text":"so as I go through I will tell you how thick the actual panels are which will include all the lining and everything else involved with the panels"},"532.00":{"start":"532","dur":"9","text":"that&#39;s going to be a really good guide to exactly how warm these wetsuits are going to be and we&#39;ll factor in a few other things to come to our decision"},"541.00":{"start":"541","dur":"20","text":"So on this wetsuit in particular, it&#39;s a 7\/6\/5 and the actual panel thicknesses are: 7.5mm on the chest and 7mm on the arms, it&#39;s the thickest wetsuit, overall, that we&#39;ve measured"},"557.00":{"start":"557","dur":"10","text":"it has this polypro lining, it&#39;s quite thick on the Billabong SG5, that lining is on these single lined panels, so the hood, the chest, the back and this kidney area"},"567.00":{"start":"567","dur":"9","text":"this is unique to Billabong, no other manufacturer does a single lined panel in this area, it&#39;s going to give your core more warmth, that&#39;s the idea anyway"},"576.00":{"start":"576","dur":"5","text":"that&#39;s one factor that&#39;s going to improve the warmth of this wetsuit"},"581.00":{"start":"581","dur":"11","text":"in terms of the sealing of the seams, as you can see here, the majority of the leg seams have exposed stitching on the inside, it&#39;s got a little bit of the liquid seal on the end of the ankle"},"592.00":{"start":"592","dur":"10","text":"The outside is liquid sealed all over the wetsuit, you can&#39;t see any stitching on the outside of this wetsuit which is going to help with keeping it warm because there&#39;s less water coming in"},"602.00":{"start":"602","dur":"6","text":"The arms are liquid sealed all the way along on the inside, so it&#39;s one of the few wetsuits to have liquid seal on the inside and outside"},"608.00":{"start":"608","dur":"9","text":"it has that on the thick arm panels so it&#39;s really going to lock in a lot of warmth and not let that water in"},"621.00":{"start":"621","dur":"10","text":"So the next one is the C-Skins Wired, this is a great value wetsuit, it&#39;s got lots of features which we&#39;ll see on the other wetsuits from other brands"},"631.00":{"start":"631","dur":"8","text":"but this is a really good value wetsuit, so it&#39;s a good one to look at if you&#39;re in the North East of England or Norway, with really cold temperatures"},"639.00":{"start":"639","dur":"7","text":"and you need a really, really warm wetsuit but you perhaps don&#39;t have the spare cash to go for one of the more expensive options"},"646.00":{"start":"646","dur":"10","text":"So the lining on the inside, as I showed you earlier, it&#39;s the standard polypro lining on the C-Skins and it goes from the Chest all the way down to the knee"},"656.00":{"start":"656","dur":"10","text":"it&#39;s a pretty good stretch, a little bit more than the Billabong wetsuit, it&#39;s not sealed on the inside, you can see the stitching inside the wetsuit"},"666.00":{"start":"666","dur":"9","text":"That&#39;s the same for the whole wetsuit, it&#39;s got this wide liquid seal on the outside which is pretty good but not as flexible as some other versions which we will get onto"},"675.00":{"start":"675","dur":"14","text":"It&#39;s got a really nice touch on the toggles, both on the hood and on the chest zip, they&#39;re attached to these little bits of webbing here so they stay in one place"},"689.00":{"start":"689","dur":"7","text":"if you&#39;ve worn a hooded wetsuit before you might have noticed the toggles, if they&#39;re not attached, I&#39;ll mention if they are, on a lot of wetsuits they aren&#39;t,"},"696.00":{"start":"696","dur":"10","text":"it will flap around a bit, I normally tuck mine inside on the chest panel and on the hood just so it doesn&#39;t keep bashing you, it&#39;s a bit off-putting"},"706.00":{"start":"706","dur":"4","text":"C-skins have dealt with that really well, they&#39;ve put a little webbing strap there which keeps them in the right place"},"710.00":{"start":"710","dur":"13","text":"We&#39;ve also got the cuff which is very similar to the one on the Xcel Drylock wetsuit, it&#39;s like a little narrower piece of neoprene"},"723.00":{"start":"723","dur":"6","text":"right on the end of the cuff which gives you a better seal against your wrist, or against a glove, especially useful against gloves and"},"729.00":{"start":"729","dur":"4","text":"with most of these wetsuits you&#39;re going to be using them with boots and gloves as well so that&#39;s a good feature to look for"},"733.00":{"start":"733","dur":"4","text":"That&#39;s not only on the C-Skins but also on the Xcel Drylock wetsuits which I&#39;ll get to in a moment"},"737.00":{"start":"737","dur":"12","text":"there&#39;s no single lined neoprene on the wetsuit, which is a bit strange, the main reason for that is so they can keep this one continual panel"},"749.00":{"start":"749","dur":"6","text":"This one huge panel which goes all the way down the front and all the way down the back, they don&#39;t break it up with a single lined panel like a lot of the wetsuits do"},"755.00":{"start":"755","dur":"13","text":"so the benefit you get from having no single lined panel here is more stretch, it helps with the stretchiness of the front and back panels"},"768.00":{"start":"768","dur":"8","text":"which is key in a lot of the movement you&#39;re doing when you&#39;re surfing, so that&#39;s one difference between between this C-Skins wetsuit and some of the others"},"776.00":{"start":"776","dur":"12","text":"when we measured the C-Skins wired hooded wetsuit, so it&#39;s listed as a 6\/5\/4, this one came up with an 8 mm panel on the chest and a 5mm panel on the arms"},"788.00":{"start":"788","dur":"10","text":"So the arms are about what we&#39;d expect but the chest is especially thick and it is all the way down to your knees so it&#39;s going to be a really good option for cold water"},"798.00":{"start":"798","dur":"3","text":"with that thick panel there which doesn&#39;t break at all"},"801.00":{"start":"801","dur":"7","text":"I think having that thick panel does make up for the fact that it isn&#39;t single lined, and doesn&#39;t have as thick a lining as some of the other wetsuits"},"808.00":{"start":"808","dur":"10","text":"At the end of the day a mm of extra neoprene is going to give you more warmth than a mm of extra polypro lining on the inside"},"818.00":{"start":"818","dur":"13","text":"The next wetsuit is the Quiksilver Fuseflex, now it&#39;s a 5.5mm wetsuit, 5.5\/5\/4\/3, so there&#39;s all sorts of thicknesses of neoprene in this wetsuit"},"831.00":{"start":"831","text":"The thinnest panels will be under the arms so you&#39;ve got most stretch in those panels because they&#39;re going to be the bits that stretch the most"},"840.00":{"start":"840","dur":"12","text":"The thickest one&#39;s will be in the chest, when we measured it came out at 5.5mm thick on the chest, 4.5mm thick on the arm panels, so pretty accurate really"},"852.00":{"start":"852","dur":"15","text":"That&#39;s one of the most accurate arm tags that we&#39;ve seen, O&#39;Neill do a really good one as well, the 52-12 which is thinner and more accurate and these are pretty much spot on what it says on the arm"},"867.00":{"start":"867","dur":"4","text":"you get what you see on the arm with the Quiksilver Fuse Flex"},"871.00":{"start":"871","dur":"8","text":"it has these new stitchless seams, and I&#39;m really impressed with the way Quiksilver have done it on the Fuse Flex,"},"879.00":{"start":"879","text":"you&#39;ll see a few seams around the hood where it takes a bit more stress but the majority of the wetsuit, all of these seams here, on the back as well, are all the &quot;Fuse Flex&quot; seam"},"889.00":{"start":"889","dur":"8","text":"it&#39;s essentially the same as the Powerseam on the Xcel wetsuits and the C-Skins Hot Wired and very similar to the Rip Curl system which I will go through in a moment"},"897.00":{"start":"897","dur":"8","text":"but there&#39;s no stitching in there so it gives you lots of flex, it&#39;s got this really thin bead of rubberised material on the outside to seal it"},"905.00":{"start":"905","dur":"9","text":"and very similar on the inside, slightly thicker perhaps but it&#39;s sealed on the inside as well and glued in the middle there, but no stitching"},"914.00":{"start":"914","dur":"11","text":"so they say it&#39;s going to be more durable, there&#39;s going to be less water coming in because there&#39;s less stitching and more flexible so it should be of benefit all round"},"925.00":{"start":"925","dur":"6","text":"with this kind of stitchless technology, so fingers crossed a lot more manufacturers are going to be using this in the future"},"936.00":{"start":"936","dur":"9","text":"The next one we&#39;ve got is the Rip Curl Flash Bomb Plus, and this is another really impressive wetsuit"},"945.00":{"start":"945","dur":"14","text":"I think it&#39;s a good all-rounder for warmth and flexibility, it&#39;s labelled as a 6\/4 and when we measured it up it came out as an 8mm panel on the chest, I&#39;ll explain why we think that is in a moment, and 5mm on the arms"},"959.00":{"start":"959","dur":"6","text":"So there&#39;s not a huge difference in the arms but the key I think in this wetsuit is the Flash Bomb lining"},"965.00":{"start":"965","dur":"10","text":"which is really, super fluffy, it dries quickly, and it&#39;s going to give you a big insulating layer as I described when we went through the polypro system"},"975.00":{"start":"975","dur":"7","text":"The toggle on the hood is pinned back, as I mentioned so it won&#39;t flap around, it won&#39;t hit you in the face"},"982.00":{"start":"982","dur":"16","text":"It&#39;s also got air chamber neoprene, they call it Air Core, that gives you an idea, it&#39;s got one perforated layer, then your inside layer with your fluffy lining"},"998.00":{"start":"998","dur":"9","text":"and then an outer layer, so the perforated layer is sandwiched in the middle, glued together, because it&#39;s got glue in there it&#39;s not quite as flexible, and perhaps a little bit heavier than standard neoprene"},"1007.00":{"start":"1007","dur":"10","text":"but they use it on the chest panel, this panel here down to the knees, this panel on the back and on the hood as well on this wetsuit"},"1017.00":{"start":"1017","dur":"6","text":"Air being the best insulator, trapping a layer of air in there has got to be a good thing, it&#39;s going to lock the warmth in"},"1023.00":{"start":"1023","dur":"10","text":"A few of the other brands are using it with different names, but this air chamber neoprene is a good touch on the Rip Curl Flash Bomb Plus wetsuit"},"1033.00":{"start":"1033","dur":"3","text":"Combine that with the polypro lining and it&#39;s going to be a really warm wetsuit"},"1039.00":{"start":"1039","dur":"2","text":"The next one we&#39;ve got is the Roxy Cypher hooded wetsuit"},"1041.00":{"start":"1041","dur":"11","text":"it&#39;s a little bit strange, it has

down to the knees"},"1135.00":{"start":"1135","dur":"4","text":"the lining is not as thick as some of the other wetsuits like the Xcel Drylock range, or Rip Curl&#39;s Flash Bomb, or Billabong&#39;s SG5"},"1139.00":{"start":"1139","dur":"8","text":"but it does go all the way down to the knees, it doesn&#39;t have really in your face branding this year which I really like"},"1147.00":{"start":"1147","dur":"9","text":"it&#39;s just got the Xcel logo there and a few other bits around, a really great, solid wetsuit for cold water,"},"1156.00":{"start":"1156","dur":"9","text":"I think you&#39;re going to get really good value out of this 6mm, it doesn&#39;t have some of the bells and whistles of the Xcel Powerseam which

warm"},"1170.00":{"start":"1170","dur":"6","text":"So, talking of the Xcel Drylock Powerseam, it&#39;s got the same sort of stitchless seams as the Quiksilver Fuse Flex wetsuit"},"1176.00":{"start":"1176","dur":"8","text":"so really flexible, durable and warm, it&#39;s got a thicker polypro lining than the Xcel 6mm Infiniti hooded

features that are going to lock the warmth in, but you also get thinner panels than some of the other wetsuits"},"1219.00":{"start":"1219","dur":"6","text":"So you&#39;re going to be more flexible

Quiksilver Fuse Flex"},"1280.00":{"start":"1280","dur":"16","text":"Likewise the Xcel Powerseam is a great one, if you&#39;re looking for one that is not quite as warm as the Billabong, the Rip Curl Flash Bomb plus is a good option"},"1296.00":{"start":"1296","dur":"7","text":"They do the normal Flash Bomb (Non Plus) option aswell which is great, it doesn&#39;t have the air core neoprene but it is another really warm wetsuit"},"1303.00":{"start":"1303","dur":"9","text":"The 6mm Xcel Infiniti is another great warm wetsuit, for flexibility with warmth we do the Xcel Drylock in a 4mm
