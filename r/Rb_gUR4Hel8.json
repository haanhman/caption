{"5":{"dur":7,"text":"Hi I'm Ben from Magicseaweed, we're going to go through the warmest surf wetsuits that we have available"},"12":{"dur":4,"text":"All the wetsuits that you see here that we are going to go through today are hooded wetsuits"},"16":{"dur":7,"text":"We do offer non-hooded versions of the same wetsuit so all the features I describe here are going to be available in non-hooded versions"},"23":{"dur":3,"text":"We're really looking for the warmest possible wetsuit that we do"},"26":{"dur":3,"text":"so all of these examples are going to have permanently attached hoods"},"31":{"dur":8,"text":"The surf specific wetsuits are not designed for Diving, triathlon or other watersports, they're really designed for surfing"},"39":{"dur":7,"text":"We're all surfer's here and we sell surf hardware and surfboards and obviously, surf wetsuits to go with them"},"46":{"dur":6,"text":"You're going to find that they will be flexible in the arms to give you paddle power when you're surfing"},"53":{"dur":8,"text":"They're not going to be single lined on parts of the wetsuit that are going to get snagged or anything like that, like some, say triathlon wetsuits might be,"},"61":{"dur":4,"text":"so they're going to be durable in the right places, so bear that in mind,"},"65":{"dur":7,"text":"if you're looking for a surfing wetsuit for really cold water, anything like 10 Degrees Celsius or below then this is going to be the video to watch"},"72":{"dur":5,"text":"We're going to outline most of the features you'll find on a whole range of winter wetsuits"},"77":{"dur":5,"text":"And then we're going to go through specifics of just these wetsuits which are perfect for really, really cold water."},"82":{"dur":3,"text":"So one of the most important things about choosing a winter wetsuit is the fit,"},"85":{"dur":7,"text":"and each brand does come up slightly differently, so we've got a really good size chart on the magicseaweed site"},"92":{"dur":7,"text":"the magicseaweed wetsuit size guide, it's going to show you all the different brands that we offer, all the different sizes that they offer within the brand"},"99":{"dur":5,"text":"and give you measurements so you can check on the size chart and see which brand might be a really good option for you"},"104":{"dur":5,"text":"I do recommend doing that because some brands come up a bit different, don't assume you're in the right sized wetsuit straight away"},"109":{"dur":4,"text":"so that's a really good thing to look at, the magicseaweed size guide."},"113":{"dur":6,"text":"The common features that you'll find on a lot of these winter wetsuits and the non hooded versions as well"},"119":{"text":"The first thing to note is the neoprene's stretchiness, now pretty much every modern wetsuit that we stock is going to have fully super flex neoprene","dur":0},"129":{"dur":6,"text":"You're going to see a lot of brand names and trade marks from different brands calling it different things"},"135":{"dur":9,"text":"Off the top of my head there's ultrastretch, there's E3 neoprene from Rip Curl, but essentially it means really, really stretchy neoprene"},"144":{"dur":5,"text":"and if you haven't had a new wetsuit in the last, probably, three seasons then you'll notice a huge difference,"},"149":{"dur":4,"text":"it's more comfortable, it's more flexible, everything about it is better pretty much"},"153":{"dur":7,"text":"combined with some of the other features I'm about to go through it's more flexible and warmer than anything you will have experienced before"},"160":{"dur":8,"text":"The other feature which is common to nearly all these wetsuits is the stitching, it's glued and blind stitched"},"168":{"dur":8,"text":"so you're probably familiar with this, they basically glue the seams together, butt the two bits of neoprene together, glue along that seam"},"176":{"text":"then they stitch it, not all the way through the neoprene from the outside to the inside, but halfway through, over the seam so it's locked together","dur":0},"184":{"dur":5,"text":"but it doesn't go all the way through, what that does is stop the water coming through from the outside of the wetsuit to the inside"},"189":{"dur":44,"text":"which is what you don't want to happen, you want the cold water to stay outside the wetsuit so that's why the blind-stitching is used"},"196":{"dur":5,"text":"So this Rip Curl Flash Bomb Plus wetsuit for instance, you can see that stitching on the arms, but that doesn't go all the way through"},"201":{"dur":7,"text":"There are some wetsuits which I will mention later that don't have any stitching at all which is a bit of an innovation this season which I'm sure we're going to see more of"},"208":{"dur":8,"text":"The other thing which we'll see on nearly all these wetsuits is \"single lined\" neoprene, here's a good example"},"216":{"dur":11,"text":"This is a Roxy Cypher hooded wetsuit, on the hood here it's got a rubberised texture on the outside, so it's lined on the inside"},"235":{"dur":7,"text":"On the outside, where you don't need it to be durable, again this is surf specific so you don't need any durability on the hood,"},"242":{"dur":8,"text":"it's not going to come into contact with anything if you're lucky, but what that does is, without the lining on the outside the water can't soak in, so it just sheets straight off,"},"250":{"dur":9,"text":"it won't stay on the outside, it won't soak in like it will on a lined wetsuit, with double lined neoprene on the rest of the wetsuit, so that's a huge benefit in terms of warmth"},"259":{"dur":4,"text":"none of the water stays in there so you don't lose any of that heat when it evaporates off"},"263":{"dur":9,"text":"another thing you're going to find on nearly all these wetsuits is polypro lining, this is fluffy,"},"272":{"dur":12,"text":"here's Rip Curls Flash Bomb lining, and this is C-Skins, similar sort of stuff, Flash bomb go a bit out of the ordinary with theirs, it's very thick"},"284":{"dur":8,"text":"The C-Skins is more like your standard polypro lining, normally they will put this on the areas which don't need as much flexibility"},"292":{"dur":4,"text":"like the chest, the hood is obviously a great area to put it on"},"296":{"dur":7,"text":"what this does is trap a layer of air, air is the best insulator you can get, any air trapped there is always good news"},"303":{"dur":11,"text":"it's going to stop the heat getting out, it also wicks water away from the body, a bit like a wool underlayer would, if you're in a cold climate and you wear that base layer"},"314":{"dur":5,"text":"so it's doing the same thing as a base layer, it sucks the water away from your skin keeping you a bit warmer"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"traps a layer of air so it insulates you and traps the warmth inside the wetsuit"},"321":{"dur":6,"text":"you're going to find that on nearly all the wetsuits, I will go through in detail how thick it is and how much of it there is a bit later on"},"327":{"dur":9,"text":"the next thing is how the manufacturers seal the wetsuits, it can be a little bit different so I will go through it individually a little bit later on"},"336":{"dur":5,"text":"but essentially, here's a Rip Curl Flash Bomb, there's no sealing on the outside, you can see the stitching, as I said, it doesn't go all the way through"},"341":{"dur":7,"text":"but you can see the stitching exposed on the outside, you'll see this on the inside of some wetsuits, it depends how the manufacturer wants to do it"},"348":{"dur":8,"text":"Rip Curl use Tape on the inside, that's their E3 plus tape, you'll find a similar thing on Xcel wetsuits, that's taped on the inside"},"356":{"dur":9,"text":"here's a C-Skins, that's got liquid seal on the outside, it's quite a wide liquid seal on the C-Skins in particular"},"365":{"dur":9,"text":"and then you can see the exposed stitching on the inside, so essentially any sort of liquid seal like this is going to be a little bit less flexible than having"},"374":{"dur":11,"text":"either exposed stitching, or a very thin bead of rubber, or even tape, slightly, tape and this sort of liquid seal I think is roughly the same sort of stretchiness"},"385":{"dur":8,"text":"but it will keep the water out, that's the idea, any water that might have got through these seams is not going to get through that liquid seal"},"393":{"dur":6,"text":"In some cases you'll find it on both sides and I will highlight that in a little while when I get to those wetsuits"},"399":{"dur":15,"text":"the other thing with hooded wetsuits, they're all front zip wetsuits, obviously having a permanently attached hood you can't really do it with a back-zip, the zip would have to go all the way up through the hood"},"414":{"dur":7,"text":"so it's not going to happen, but front zip wetsuits have really come in in a big way in the last few seasons, if you haven't had one before it might take a little bit of getting used to"},"421":{"dur":9,"text":"to get in and out but after two or three times I think you'll find it goes off and on smoothly so don't be afraid of going for a front zip wetsuit"},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"if it's a good fit for you then you should be able to get in and out no problem"},"433":{"dur":5,"text":"so all of them are front zip wetsuits, there's slight differences in the zips which I will go through if it's relevant a bit later on"},"438":{"dur":7,"text":"and obviously permanently attached hoods on all these wetsuits, you can't take them off, as I said though you do get non-hooded versions"},"445":{"dur":6,"text":"so you can get the non-hooded wetsuit with all the same technology and features which doesn't have the permanently attached hood"},"451":{"dur":8,"text":"they are perhaps a little more versatile if you're in warmer waters but this video is really focussing on really cold water,"},"459":{"dur":4,"text":"where we want a permanently attached hood to stop any water getting in through that neck area at all"},"465":{"dur":7,"text":"So that's pretty much all the common features on these wetsuits and the other winter wetsuits that we stock, whether they're hooded or not"},"472":{"dur":8,"text":"so I'm going to go through a few of the specifics before we get down to which one is going to be the warmest wetsuit for you when you're surfing in cold water"},"484":{"dur":15,"text":"So we'll go in alphabetical order, we've got the Billabong SG5 7\/6\/5 wetsuit, the 7\/6\/5 is rating the thickness of the neoprene"},"499":{"dur":12,"text":"in various areas, on various panels of the wetsuit, what you'll find is that it relates to the thickness of the actual neoprene foam rather than the full effective thickness that you get from the wetsuit"},"511":{"dur":12,"text":"On that count, we have measured all these wetsuits with these callipers, these are super sensitive, these will measure fractions of a millimetre"},"523":{"dur":9,"text":"so as I go through I will tell you how thick the actual panels are which will include all the lining and everything else involved with the panels"},"532":{"dur":9,"text":"that's going to be a really good guide to exactly how warm these wetsuits are going to be and we'll factor in a few other things to come to our decision"},"541":{"dur":20,"text":"So on this wetsuit in particular, it's a 7\/6\/5 and the actual panel thicknesses are: 7.5mm on the chest and 7mm on the arms, it's the thickest wetsuit, overall, that we've measured"},"557":{"dur":10,"text":"it has this polypro lining, it's quite thick on the Billabong SG5, that lining is on these single lined panels, so the hood, the chest, the back and this kidney area"},"567":{"dur":9,"text":"this is unique to Billabong, no other manufacturer does a single lined panel in this area, it's going to give your core more warmth, that's the idea anyway"},"576":{"dur":5,"text":"that's one factor that's going to improve the warmth of this wetsuit"},"581":{"dur":11,"text":"in terms of the sealing of the seams, as you can see here, the majority of the leg seams have exposed stitching on the inside, it's got a little bit of the liquid seal on the end of the ankle"},"592":{"dur":10,"text":"The outside is liquid sealed all over the wetsuit, you can't see any stitching on the outside of this wetsuit which is going to help with keeping it warm because there's less water coming in"},"602":{"dur":6,"text":"The arms are liquid sealed all the way along on the inside, so it's one of the few wetsuits to have liquid seal on the inside and outside"},"608":{"dur":9,"text":"it has that on the thick arm panels so it's really going to lock in a lot of warmth and not let that water in"},"621":{"dur":10,"text":"So the next one is the C-Skins Wired, this is a great value wetsuit, it's got lots of features which we'll see on the other wetsuits from other brands"},"631":{"dur":8,"text":"but this is a really good value wetsuit, so it's a good one to look at if you're in the North East of England or Norway, with really cold temperatures"},"639":{"dur":7,"text":"and you need a really, really warm wetsuit but you perhaps don't have the spare cash to go for one of the more expensive options"},"646":{"dur":10,"text":"So the lining on the inside, as I showed you earlier, it's the standard polypro lining on the C-Skins and it goes from the Chest all the way down to the knee"},"656":{"dur":10,"text":"it's a pretty good stretch, a little bit more than the Billabong wetsuit, it's not sealed on the inside, you can see the stitching inside the wetsuit"},"666":{"dur":9,"text":"That's the same for the whole wetsuit, it's got this wide liquid seal on the outside which is pretty good but not as flexible as some other versions which we will get onto"},"675":{"dur":14,"text":"It's got a really nice touch on the toggles, both on the hood and on the chest zip, they're attached to these little bits of webbing here so they stay in one place"},"689":{"dur":7,"text":"if you've worn a hooded wetsuit before you might have noticed the toggles, if they're not attached, I'll mention if they are, on a lot of wetsuits they aren't,"},"696":{"dur":10,"text":"it will flap around a bit, I normally tuck mine inside on the chest panel and on the hood just so it doesn't keep bashing you, it's a bit off-putting"},"706":{"dur":4,"text":"C-skins have dealt with that really well, they've put a little webbing strap there which keeps them in the right place"},"710":{"dur":13,"text":"We've also got the cuff which is very similar to the one on the Xcel Drylock wetsuit, it's like a little narrower piece of neoprene"},"723":{"dur":6,"text":"right on the end of the cuff which gives you a better seal against your wrist, or against a glove, especially useful against gloves and"},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"with most of these wetsuits you're going to be using them with boots and gloves as well so that's a good feature to look for"},"733":{"dur":4,"text":"That's not only on the C-Skins but also on the Xcel Drylock wetsuits which I'll get to in a moment"},"737":{"dur":12,"text":"there's no single lined neoprene on the wetsuit, which is a bit strange, the main reason for that is so they can keep this one continual panel"},"749":{"dur":6,"text":"This one huge panel which goes all the way down the front and all the way down the back, they don't break it up with a single lined panel like a lot of the wetsuits do"},"755":{"dur":13,"text":"so the benefit you get from having no single lined panel here is more stretch, it helps with the stretchiness of the front and back panels"},"768":{"dur":8,"text":"which is key in a lot of the movement you're doing when you're surfing, so that's one difference between between this C-Skins wetsuit and some of the others"},"776":{"dur":12,"text":"when we measured the C-Skins wired hooded wetsuit, so it's listed as a 6\/5\/4, this one came up with an 8 mm panel on the chest and a 5mm panel on the arms"},"788":{"dur":10,"text":"So the arms are about what we'd expect but the chest is especially thick and it is all the way down to your knees so it's going to be a really good option for cold water"},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"with that thick panel there which doesn't break at all"},"801":{"dur":7,"text":"I think having that thick panel does make up for the fact that it isn't single lined, and doesn't have as thick a lining as some of the other wetsuits"},"808":{"dur":10,"text":"At the end of the day a mm of extra neoprene is going to give you more warmth than a mm of extra polypro lining on the inside"},"818":{"dur":13,"text":"The next wetsuit is the Quiksilver Fuseflex, now it's a 5.5mm wetsuit, 5.5\/5\/4\/3, so there's all sorts of thicknesses of neoprene in this wetsuit"},"831":{"text":"The thinnest panels will be under the arms so you've got most stretch in those panels because they're going to be the bits that stretch the most","dur":0},"840":{"dur":12,"text":"The thickest one's will be in the chest, when we measured it came out at 5.5mm thick on the chest, 4.5mm thick on the arm panels, so pretty accurate really"},"852":{"dur":15,"text":"That's one of the most accurate arm tags that we've seen, O'Neill do a really good one as well, the 52-12 which is thinner and more accurate and these are pretty much spot on what it says on the arm"},"867":{"dur":4,"text":"you get what you see on the arm with the Quiksilver Fuse Flex"},"871":{"dur":8,"text":"it has these new stitchless seams, and I'm really impressed with the way Quiksilver have done it on the Fuse Flex,"},"879":{"text":"you'll see a few seams around the hood where it takes a bit more stress but the majority of the wetsuit, all of these seams here, on the back as well, are all the \"Fuse Flex\" seam","dur":0},"889":{"dur":8,"text":"it's essentially the same as the Powerseam on the Xcel wetsuits and the C-Skins Hot Wired and very similar to the Rip Curl system which I will go through in a moment"},"897":{"dur":8,"text":"but there's no stitching in there so it gives you lots of flex, it's got this really thin bead of rubberised material on the outside to seal it"},"905":{"dur":9,"text":"and very similar on the inside, slightly thicker perhaps but it's sealed on the inside as well and glued in the middle there, but no stitching"},"914":{"dur":11,"text":"so they say it's going to be more durable, there's going to be less water coming in because there's less stitching and more flexible so it should be of benefit all round"},"925":{"dur":6,"text":"with this kind of stitchless technology, so fingers crossed a lot more manufacturers are going to be using this in the future"},"936":{"dur":9,"text":"The next one we've got is the Rip Curl Flash Bomb Plus, and this is another really impressive wetsuit"},"945":{"dur":14,"text":"I think it's a good all-rounder for warmth and flexibility, it's labelled as a 6\/4 and when we measured it up it came out as an 8mm panel on the chest, I'll explain why we think that is in a moment, and 5mm on the arms"},"959":{"dur":6,"text":"So there's not a huge difference in the arms but the key I think in this wetsuit is the Flash Bomb lining"},"965":{"dur":10,"text":"which is really, super fluffy, it dries quickly, and it's going to give you a big insulating layer as I described when we went through the polypro system"},"975":{"dur":7,"text":"The toggle on the hood is pinned back, as I mentioned so it won't flap around, it won't hit you in the face"},"982":{"dur":16,"text":"It's also got air chamber neoprene, they call it Air Core, that gives you an idea, it's got one perforated layer, then your inside layer with your fluffy lining"},"998":{"dur":9,"text":"and then an outer layer, so the perforated layer is sandwiched in the middle, glued together, because it's got glue in there it's not quite as flexible, and perhaps a little bit heavier than standard neoprene"},"1007":{"dur":10,"text":"but they use it on the chest panel, this panel here down to the knees, this panel on the back and on the hood as well on this wetsuit"},"1017":{"dur":6,"text":"Air being the best insulator, trapping a layer of air in there has got to be a good thing, it's going to lock the warmth in"},"1023":{"dur":10,"text":"A few of the other brands are using it with different names, but this air chamber neoprene is a good touch on the Rip Curl Flash Bomb Plus wetsuit"},"1033":{"dur":3,"text":"Combine that with the polypro lining and it's going to be a really warm wetsuit"},"1039":{"dur":2,"text":"The next one we've got is the Roxy Cypher hooded wetsuit"},"1041":{"dur":11,"text":"it's a little bit strange, it has a 4mm panel here on the chest, it says on the arm it's a 5\/4\/3"},"1052":{"dur":11,"text":"the 3mm is under the arms but the 4mm stretches all the way out over the arms, these panels here are a little bit thicker, and the main panel on the body here is thicker again"},"1063":{"dur":12,"text":"That will be the 4.5mm panels, but the chest is a 4mm panel, I think they've done that because it stretches all the way over the arms and you need to have flexibility in the arms"},"1075":{"dur":9,"text":"but it means that the chest panel is the thinnest of any of these hooded wetsuits that we do, it's a really good performance wetsuit though, they've got liquid seal on the outside"},"1084":{"dur":11,"text":"stitched on the inside, glued and blind stitched, I think it's going to be warm obviously because it's a hooded wetsuit, but not as warm as the Rip Curl flash bomb hooded wetsuit"},"1095":{"dur":7,"text":"or the Xcel 6mm infiniti hooded wetsuit for women which are very similar to their counterparts in the mens range"},"1102":{"dur":10,"text":"This one, likes the mens Quiksilver Cypher, has a bit more of a performance edge, so it's going to be stretchier, more flexible but not quite as warm"},"1112":{"dur":11,"text":"Next we've got the Xcel 6mm Infiniti wetsuit, it's a really, really warm wetsuit and one that people have been using for years in cold climates"},"1123":{"dur":12,"text":"it says 6\/5\/4 on the arm, we came up with 7mm on the chest, and 5.5mm on the arm, it's got the polypro lining from the chest all the way down to the knees"},"1135":{"dur":4,"text":"the lining is not as thick as some of the other wetsuits like the Xcel Drylock range, or Rip Curl's Flash Bomb, or Billabong's SG5"},"1139":{"dur":8,"text":"but it does go all the way down to the knees, it doesn't have really in your face branding this year which I really like"},"1147":{"dur":9,"text":"it's just got the Xcel logo there and a few other bits around, a really great, solid wetsuit for cold water,"},"1156":{"dur":9,"text":"I think you're going to get really good value out of this 6mm, it doesn't have some of the bells and whistles of the Xcel Powerseam which I'll go onto in a moment"},"1165":{"dur":3,"text":"or say the Rip Curl Flash Bomb Plus, but it's a solid wetsuit that's going to keep you really warm"},"1170":{"dur":6,"text":"So, talking of the Xcel Drylock Powerseam, it's got the same sort of stitchless seams as the Quiksilver Fuse Flex wetsuit"},"1176":{"dur":8,"text":"so really flexible, durable and warm, it's got a thicker polypro lining than the Xcel 6mm Infiniti hooded wetsuit,"},"1184":{"dur":5,"text":"it's kind of between the Xcel Infiniti and the Rip Curl on the polypro lining, it goes from the chest to the knees"},"1189":{"dur":11,"text":"the hood has got this air chamber, Airprene neoprene, likewise the chest and the back panels, so you've got that insulating layer as well"},"1200":{"dur":4,"text":"so it's another really, really warm wetsuit, when we measured up the panels"},"1204":{"dur":8,"text":"it came in at 6.5mm on the chest and 4.5mm on the arms so it's a bit of a compromise between flexibility, performance, and warmth with the Powerseam"},"1212":{"dur":7,"text":"you get a lot of features that are going to lock the warmth in, but you also get thinner panels than some of the other wetsuits"},"1219":{"dur":6,"text":"So you're going to be more flexible than something like the Billabong SG5 or the Rip Curl Flash Bomb wetsuit"},"1225":{"dur":9,"text":"So in conclusion, the warmest wetsuit that we do, having measured all the panels and looked at all the different features that they offer on the wetsuits"},"1234":{"dur":8,"text":"Is going to be the Billabong, it's the SG5 7\/6\/5, no surprises really because it's the thickest wetsuit that we offer"},"1242":{"dur":17,"text":"It's going to be super, super warm, so if you're in sub 10 degree celsius temperatures, in the sea and you want to be warm and flexibility is not the priority then the SG5 is a really great option"},"1259":{"dur":4,"text":"You can watch the video on that individual wetsuit as well to find out a bit more about it"},"1263":{"dur":17,"text":"The wetsuits that we think are going to be a good combination of warmth and flexibility are the Quiksilver Fuse Flex"},"1280":{"dur":16,"text":"Likewise the Xcel Powerseam is a great one, if you're looking for one that is not quite as warm as the Billabong, the Rip Curl Flash Bomb plus is a good option"},"1296":{"dur":7,"text":"They do the normal Flash Bomb (Non Plus) option aswell which is great, it doesn't have the air core neoprene but it is another really warm wetsuit"},"1303":{"dur":9,"text":"The 6mm Xcel Infiniti is another great warm wetsuit, for flexibility with warmth we do the Xcel Drylock in a 4mm hooded"},"1312":{"dur":10,"text":"Which is going to be really nice and flexible, the Roxy Cypher, if you're looking for a womens wetsuit, go for the Roxy if you're after performance"},"1322":{"dur":12,"text":"That pretty much wraps it up, go for a Billabong SG5 7\/6\/5 if you're after a really, really warm surf wetsuit for the coldest of the cold water"},"1334":{"dur":7,"text":"Here at Magicseaweed we offer free shipping on wetsuits worldwide, we've got all these wetsuits in stock at the moment"},"1341":{"dur":5,"text":"If
