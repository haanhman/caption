dangerous."},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"Clive: Okay."},"40":{"dur":10,"text":"Okay, so renormalizing smoking, it's never\nbeen that obvious to me why the emergence"},"50":{"dur":4,"text":"of an alternative technology to smoking somehow\nnormalizes smoking."},"55":{"dur":5,"text":"Surely, what it does is normalize the alternative\nbehavior, which is giving up smoking by

that."},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"It does exactly the opposite, and there's\nno evidence to support it."},"79":{"dur":5,"text":"It's just a made-up argument that has no basis\nin reality, and to be

e-cigarettes."},"91":{"dur":1,"text":"They market an alternative."},"93":{"dur":2,"text":"Sally: Gateway?"},"96":{"dur":1,"text":"Clive: Gateway effect."},"97":{"dur":4,"text":"First of all, there are the people who talk\nabout the gateway effect."},"102":{"dur":4,"text":"When you actually say, \"Well, what exactly\ndo you mean by a gateway effect?\""},"107":{"dur":4,"text":"What you'll get is some slightly confused\nor very confused, often, things about, \"Well,"},"111":{"dur":3,"text":"they started on e-cigarettes and then they\nwent to cigarettes, okay?"},"115":{"dur":2,"text":"And that means the e-cigarettes were a gateway.\""},"117":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn't mean that at all."},"120":{"dur":6,"text":"To understand whether there was a gateway,\nwhat you have to do is imagine a world without"},"127":{"dur":3,"text":"e-cigarettes and look at all patterns of smoking\nthere would be."},"130":{"dur":4,"text":"So some people never smoke, some people would\nsmoke."},"134":{"dur":5,"text":"And then you introduce e-cigarettes into that\nworld and those pathways all change."},"139":{"dur":5,"text":"So some people who smoke would switch to e-cigarettes\nand then maybe quit completely, and that's"},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"a gateway exit."},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a good gateway."},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"Those are the gateways we want."},"150":{"dur":4,"text":"So then you have to find...to find a really\nharmful gateway, you have to find someone"},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"who would never have smoked, and bare in mind,\nit's hard to know that."},"158":{"dur":4,"text":"They have to then switch to e-cigarettes,\nwhich does them a bit of harm that they wouldn't"},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"have done to themselves otherwise."},"165":{"dur":4,"text":"And then they have to move on and graduate\nto the big harm, which is smoking."},"170":{"dur":4,"text":"So finding people that have gone down that\npathway is extremely difficult."},"175":{"dur":3,"text":"No one can really produce the people that\nhave done that."},"178":{"dur":5,"text":"None of the studies really do show that, and\nnone of them are set up to do that kind of"},"183":{"dur":4,"text":"follow-up work or to measure people as they\nprogress through these things."},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"So what happens is that people overclaim on\ngateway effects."},"191":{"dur":5,"text":"They find associations between vaping and\nsmoking and then they conclude that the vaping"},"197":{"dur":1,"text":"is causing the smoking."},"199":{"dur":4,"text":"What is much more likely, though, is that\nthe same things that incline people to smoke"},"203":{"dur":1,"text":"are the same things that incline them to vape."},"205":{"dur":4,"text":"In other words, there are same personality\ncharacteristics that cause the two things"},"210":{"dur":1,"text":"to happen."},"211":{"dur":5,"text":"And if they take up vaping and they would\nhave otherwise smoked, it's a benefit to them."},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"So I don't think there's anything in the gateway\neffect, and when the Royal College of Physicians"},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"looked at this, and Public Health England, they\nsaid, \"First of all, the concept's so woolily"},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"defined, it shouldn't even be used.\""},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"And certainly, there's no evidence to suggest\nthat's happening on a meaningful scale."},"230":{"dur":4,"text":"Sally: Yeah, and the epidemiology certainly\nbears that out in that there are fewer and"},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"fewer teens who are smoking."},"238":{"dur":1,"text":"So if there were..."},"239":{"dur":1,"text":"Clive: Yeah."},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the big story."},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"If there was a gateway effect, where are all\nthe people who are emerging the other side"},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"of the gate?"},"245":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Right, exactly."},"246":{"dur":1,"text":"Clive: You know, they're not there."},"247":{"dur":7,"text":"In fact, teenage smoking is falling to the\nlowest levels and at the fastest rate in history,"},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"coinciding with the rise of vaping."},"257":{"dur":3,"text":"So it suggests that if there's a gateway,\nit's an exit, not an entry to smoking."},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"The other one was dual use."},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"Clive: Okay."},"264":{"dur":5,"text":"So dual use, it's odd that people think that\ndual use is a bad thing."},"269":{"dur":5,"text":"If somebody starts using a different product\ninstead of smoking, there are a number of"},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"good things that could come out of that."},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"First of all, if they carry on, then their\nrisk is likely to be reduced."},"280":{"dur":4,"text":"Some of the health effects of smoking are\nproportional to exposure."},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"And therefore, if you reduce your exposure..."},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: You have the respiratory effects."},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"Clive: Yeah, exactly."},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"And actually, cancer effects as well."},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"Sally: But the cardiovascular, we're not so\nsure."},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"Clive: Cardiovascular, there's some doubt\nabout where there's non-linear effects and"},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"so on, so there may not such a benefit there."},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"But hell, respiratory cancer, that's something."},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: That's huge."},"300":{"dur":5,"text":"Clive: Then it's the argument that actually\nmany...you have to look at this dynamically."},"306":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you just take a snapshot, you may be\nmissing the fact that people are on a lengthy"},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"transition."},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"They're going from being 100% smokers and\nthey're gradually shifting through dual use"},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"to not smoking at all, or smoking on an occasional\nbasis."},"321":{"dur":5,"text":"And then the final thing I think to say about\ndual use is it's not one thing."},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, somebody who vapes all the time\nand then smokes a bit at the weekend when"},"330":{"dur":3,"text":"they've had a few drinks, they're not at particular\nrisk."},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"Occasional smoking isn't a big deal."},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"It's daily smoking that you need to worry\nabout."},"338":{"dur":5,"text":"And of course, they are very different to\nsomebody who smokes all the time and vapes"},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"every now when, you know, they're not allowed\nto smoke."},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"So those are two people who would both be\nclassified as dual users, but their pattern"},"351":{"dur":4,"text":"of use is completely different, that it's\nmeaningless to lump them together in a single"},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"category."},"357":{"dur":4,"text":"So you need to dive into the data to understand\nwhat's going with dual use, but it's definitely"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"not a bad thing."},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"It's only goodness comes from dual use, no\nbadness."},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Nicotine?"},"367":{"dur":7,"text":"Clive: Well, nicotine has been studied extensively\nfor many, many years in a way in which it's"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"consumed separate to smoking."},"377":{"dur":7,"text":"So nicotine replacement therapy patches and\ngums and smokeless tobacco, Snus, for example."},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"It's pretty clear that nicotine is not the\nharmful agent."},"387":{"dur":5,"text":"It's not completely benign, but then caffeine\nisn't completely benign either."},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"Nicotine does have some effects on the body,\nso, you know, it changes pulse rate."},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"It has effects on the cardiovascular system."},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"And what people have been doing is they'd\nbeen measuring those effects and going, \"Oh,"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"look, something bad is happening.\""},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"But actually, that's normal."},"406":{"dur":4,"text":"Those bad things happen when people take caffeine,\nwhen people go running, when people listen"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"to rock music."},"413":{"dur":4,"text":"You see physiological responses to these things,\nbut they don't necessarily lead to people"},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"keeling over dead with heart attacks and strokes\nin the future."},"421":{"dur":4,"text":"Sally: And they tend not...in many of these\nstudies that look at the effects of vaping,"},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"they don't compare them to cigarettes because\nthe whole keyword here is \"relative.\""},"429":{"dur":4,"text":"Clive: Well, the Surgeon General did a very\nexhaustive review of the health effects of"},"434":{"dur":4,"text":"smoking, and the conclusion of that was that\nthe things that cause cardiovascular disease"},"439":{"dur":7,"text":"in nicotine is the products of combustion\nlike carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen."},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"They're just not present in e-cigarettes because\nthere's no combustion."},"450":{"dur":7,"text":"So I think they're trying to argue that nicotine\nis a harmful agent because it's integral to"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"the product."},"459":{"dur":5,"text":"You obviously can't take it out or it's no\nlonger a substitute, but we've never heard"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"in the past about passive nicotine exposure."},"467":{"dur":5,"text":"We've never really had the emphasis on nicotine\nas the harmful agent until now."},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"And the truth is it's not completely benign."},"475":{"dur":7,"text":"There may be issues for pregnant women or\nfor teenagers, but in all circumstances,
