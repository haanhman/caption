What"},"268":{"dur":13,"text":"does that look like? What image are you seeing?\nOkay, you can open your eyes now. Now, some"},"282":{"dur":7,"text":"of you might be seeing something like this.\nSo this is a linear image of time. Past flows"},"290":{"dur":4,"text":"into present, flows into future.

I\u2019ve\nspent years working in educational futures"},"461":{"dur":4,"text":"and I got really bored in the end of people\nstanding up and saying we should radically"},"465":{"dur":4,"text":"change the school curriculum.

You actually have to\nthink carefully about how you might use the"},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"resources we have. The reality is, when we\nthink about our curriculum and when we think"},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"about our subjects, it is very clear that\nit isn\u2019t necessarily about teaching new"},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"things. It\u2019s about being clear that what\nwe have are already resources for thinking"},"490":{"dur":5,"text":"about the future. We just need to do it differently.\nSo instead of seeing subjects as containers"},"496":{"dur":6,"text":"for pumping lots of information into empty\nbrains, we need to see subjects as procedures"},"502":{"dur":6,"text":"for helping us deal with new information.\nSo this goes back to the invention of subjects."},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"After all, subjects and disciplines have not\nalways existed so they were invented in the"},"513":{"dur":5,"text":"18th century when we had a crisis of information.\nSuddenly, before this, if you were educated"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"you basically read a small number of books\nand all the other educated people read the"},"522":{"dur":4,"text":"same books and you wrote letters to each other.\nThat was what it was meant to be educated."},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"Then they started publishing loads of books\nand suddenly everybody went into a little"},"530":{"dur":5,"text":"bit of a meltdown. The information overload\nis not a new phenomenon, folks. So what they"},"536":{"dur":6,"text":"did was they decided to invent subjects and\ndisciplines as ways of dealing with new information."},"542":{"dur":5,"text":"So the way we think about this then is don\u2019t\nsee science as a body of knowledge that downloads"},"548":{"dur":4,"text":"into you. Think of it as a set of procedures\nfor helping you deal with new information."},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"How do you trust it? How do you validate it?\nSimilarly, don\u2019t see the study of literature"},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"as just kind of the acceptance of a load of\nbooks, but as a way of thinking about how"},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"new ideas relate to old ideas. Think about\nT S Elliot, tradition and the individual talent"},"567":{"dur":4,"text":"for those of you who remember that. So, in\nother words, we need to flip our approach"},"571":{"dur":6,"text":"to subjects on the head, not get rid of them.\nWe need to see them as tools for helping us"},"577":{"dur":6,"text":"think about tomorrow and think about novelty.\nThe second thing that we need to do in schools"},"583":{"dur":5,"text":"is recognise that we are already teaching.\nWe\u2019re just not explicit about it. A set"},"589":{"dur":5,"text":"of orientations towards the future and that\nthese stretch across different disciplines."},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"So, first orientation to the future, that\nwe are teaching, that we need to talk about"},"599":{"dur":6,"text":"more is stewardship. Stewardship is the capacity\nto protect and care for and nurture diversity"},"606":{"dur":6,"text":"and we see it in everything, from studying\nancient civilisation to studying biodiversity."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"When we\u2019re teaching stewardship, we\u2019re\nteaching the value of diversity in the world"},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"and the value of keeping diverse sorts of\nknowledge as a resource for keeping the future"},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"open. The second thing we\u2019re teaching is\nmodelling. We\u2019ve seen lots of examples of"},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"modelling this evening. Modelling is thinking\nabout how different variables might interact"},"630":{"dur":5,"text":"to create something unexpected, parasites\nand weather, for example. So we tend to think"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"of modelling as the thing that happens in\nscience and mathematics but it\u2019s also what"},"639":{"dur":5,"text":"happens in drama and in literature, which\nare imaginative moments for thinking about"},"644":{"dur":6,"text":"how new possibilities might emerge. So teaching\nmodelling. It\u2019s about teaching us to explore"},"651":{"dur":6,"text":"and to think about unintended or unexpected\nconsequences and interactions. The third element"},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"of what we teach is reflexivity. Now, this\nought to be taught across all subject areas"},"661":{"dur":6,"text":"but it does tend to end up in social sciences,\nwhich is the systematic capacity to question"},"667":{"dur":5,"text":"our assumptions, our beliefs and our ideas\nabout what counts as common sense. Teaching"},"673":{"dur":5,"text":"reflexivity is about teaching us to ask what\ninformation is missing and what perspectives"},"678":{"dur":6,"text":"are present or absent? Finally, the fourth\norientation to the future that we are already"},"685":{"dur":5,"text":"teaching but we need to pull together across\noral areas is experimentation, and this is"},"690":{"dur":5,"text":"the astonishing human capacity that starts\nfrom the assumption that the best way to predict"},"695":{"dur":5,"text":"the future is to build it. When we\u2019re teaching\nexperimentation, we\u2019re teaching the ability"},"701":{"dur":5,"text":"to create little jetties into the future,\nto create prototypes, to play with possibilities"},"707":{"dur":4,"text":"and to reflect on them. So what we need to\ndo is work out how to support students to"},"711":{"dur":5,"text":"get better at seeing how these different orientations\nrelate to each other. Think about when should"},"717":{"dur":4,"text":"we be modelling? When is that the right approach?\nWhen shall we be stewarding? When should we"},"722":{"dur":6,"text":"be experimenting? Critically, we need students\nwho can use this repertoire fluently, okay."},"729":{"dur":6,"text":"We need no more engineers who can only experiment\nand not steward and no more critical social"},"735":{"dur":5,"text":"scientists who can do reflexivity but can\u2019t\nmake anything, and I speak as a social scientist."},"741":{"dur":5,"text":"So the critical issue here is that the content\nof future\u2019s literacy doesn\u2019t require us"},"746":{"dur":6,"text":"actually to radically change everything we\u2019re\ndoing in schools, it just requires us to recalibrate."},"753":{"dur":7,"text":"Now, the third element of future\u2019s literacy\nis arguably the most important. It\u2019s about"},"760":{"dur":4,"text":"learning to live with our emotions. Think\nabout the emotions you\u2019ve already experienced"},"764":{"dur":5,"text":"this evening. I\u2019ve got probably hope, kind\nof slight disgust that those worms brought"},"769":{"dur":5,"text":"back all sorts of traumatic memories of school,\nand optimism and slight fear when you see"},"775":{"dur":5,"text":"lots of bad things happening. So what we need\nto do is think about how we work with the"},"781":{"dur":5,"text":"emotions that are engendered every time we\nthink about the future. So again, what I want"},"787":{"dur":5,"text":"you to do is take a minute and close your\neyes and think about the emotions that come"},"793":{"dur":6,"text":"to mind when we hear different ideas of the\nfuture. So, for example, if I said to you"},"799":{"dur":6,"text":"the future is going to be the same as the\npresent, what does that make you feel? If"},"805":{"dur":5,"text":"I said the future is going to be crisis and\ncatastrophe, and everything we know descends"},"811":{"dur":7,"text":"into chaos, how do you feel? If I said the\nfuture is going to be kind of okay but we\u2019re"},"818":{"dur":6,"text":"just going to have to manage how much we use,\nlimit ourselves, try and fit within constraints,"},"825":{"dur":6,"text":"how does that make you feel? If I said the\nfuture is going to be of radical transformation,"},"831":{"dur":5,"text":"so Star Trek model, no more money, transformed\nreality, completely different ways, how does"},"837":{"dur":7,"text":"that make you feel? Okay, these four stories\nof the future are what Jim Dator calls the"},"845":{"dur":7,"text":"four core myths of the future, constraint,\ncontinuity, restraint, collapse and transformation."},"852":{"dur":5,"text":"That\u2019s wrong. Continuity, restraint, collapse\nand transformation. So what I am interested"},"858":{"dur":5,"text":"in though is thinking about your responses\nto those. Are you feeling anxiety or hope?"},"863":{"dur":7,"text":"Is there desire or passion or fear? What does\nyour emotion in relation to the future effect?"},"871":{"dur":5,"text":"How does it affect the decisions that you\u2019re\nmaking? The most important thing is to recognise"},"877":{"dur":5,"text":"that a particular objective future doesn\u2019t\nhave to be tied to a particular emotion, and"},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"that different emotions might be useful at\ndifferent times for different people, and"},"886":{"dur":4,"text":"here I am reminded of the brilliant project\nby Sue Porter here at Bristol that brought"},"891":{"dur":5,"text":"together environmental activists and disability\ncampaigners to explore what it means to live"},"897":{"dur":5,"text":"with the loss of a future that had been hoped\nfor and to think about what unexpected better"},"902":{"dur":6,"text":"futures might emerge from a moment of grief\nand sorrow. Similarly, I\u2019m reminded of Vanessa"},"909":{"dur":6,"text":"Andreotti\u2019s work that talks about that it\u2019s\nonly in giving up on hope for old futures"},"916":{"dur":4,"text":"that we grew up with that it\u2019s only by holding\nan old civilisation and hospicing it through"},"921":{"dur":7,"text":"to its final days to death that we can actually\nbegin to wait for something new to emerge."},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"So the critical thing I want us to bear in\nmind when we\u2019re thinking about emotions"},"933":{"dur":7,"text":"is that not that certain futures are necessarily\nassociated with positive emotions, but instead"},"940":{"dur":5,"text":"to explore and to think ourselves how we\u2019re\ndealing with and how fear and hope and love"},"945":{"dur":6,"text":"and care are all concerned in our thinking\nabout the future and what work those different"},"951":{"dur":9,"text":"emotions are doing.

Now,\ntoo often, agency in the field of climate"},"965":{"dur":5,"text":"change is about recycling, doing a bit more\nrecycling. If you\u2019re really lucky as kids,"},"971":{"dur":5,"text":"you get to do a bit more recycling and you\nget to write a letter to your MP. Brilliant."},"977":{"dur":6,"text":"This is clearly nonsense. We know that change\nin complex societies happens in a whole range"},"984":{"dur":5,"text":"of different ways and that radical and unexpected\nchange is possible. Who would have thought"},"989":{"dur":7,"text":"that Ireland would be the first country to\nvote for gay marriage by referendum? Tipping"},"996":{"dur":5,"text":"points are possible. So a core element of\nthe capacity for building collective action"},"1002":{"dur":5,"text":"is recognising that change happens in a whole\nload of different ways and that we have more"},"1007":{"dur":5,"text":"options open to us than recycling and feeling\nguilty about flying. So some of the examples"},"1013":{"dur":4,"text":"are how does change happen in society? Well,\nit does happen through violence. It happens"},"1017":{"dur":4,"text":"through non-violence. It happens through inspired\nleadership. It happens through education."},"1022":{"dur":5,"text":"It happens through gaining the power through\nrepresentative democracy. It\u2019s about inventing"},"1027":{"dur":3,"text":"things. It could be about discovering things.\nIt could be about recovering things. It could"},"1030":{"dur":7,"text":"be about corruption. It could be about changing\nlaw. This then is the final element of future\u2019s"},"1038":{"dur":4,"text":"literacy.

What"},"1053":{"dur":5,"text":"does it mean for all of us here? Well, frankly,\nit means that all of us who have an interest"},"1058":{"dur":6,"text":"in climate change need to call out the current\norganisation of schooling for what it is,"},"1065":{"dur":5,"text":"a crazy individualised, information obsessed,\ncontent driven performance and management"},"1071":{"dur":7,"text":"fixated system that is not going to do the\njob of developing citizens able to deal with"},"1078":{"dur":10,"text":"the intellectual emotional and practical challenges\nof climate change [applause].

Think about\nhow to help and support them and offer advice"},"1109":{"dur":8,"text":"and assistance. Secondly, those of us in universities\nhave to act where we stand.
