know,"},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"near the end of his life faced\nsome financial challenges and hoped"},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"that he would be leaving\nsome money for his stepson"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"and Dolly by selling his writings."},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"I think Michael just wants\nto share his knowledge"},"598":{"dur":5,"text":"and inspire conversation,\nbut

only"},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"on Madison, but on\ndemagogues and democracy,"},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"that they are very deep\nthinkers about the country"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"and about the future

--"},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"this is on request -- and\nsome current challenges"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"that we have as a country."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think that that\n-- we're in Washington."},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"We're at a really unique\nmoment in our history,"},"709":{"dur":6,"text":"and I would like to\nkind of go for the --"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"go for something a little\ndeeper with this talk."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"So -- and I'm really appreciative\nto the Library of Congress"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"for creating that opportunity."},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"So thank you very much."},"723":{"dur":4,"text":"All right, why write a book\nabout Madison for five years?"},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"There's other books out there."},"730":{"dur":5,"text":"This particular book to me beckoned\nfor a couple different reasons."},"735":{"dur":4,"text":"The first was I do feel,\nbeing in Charlottesville,"},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"that Jefferson overshadow\nMadison to our peril."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"We do have a section of the\nVirginia code, which requires us"},"746":{"dur":4,"text":"to quote Thomas Jefferson anytime we\nstart speaking in public [laughter]."},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"I throw people in jail for it\nall the time if they don't."},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"No, I'm just kidding."},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"But Madison is overshadowed,\nto our peril."},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"There are significant parts\nabout his legacy and his thinking"},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"that do get overshadowed."},"762":{"dur":4,"text":"So in writing the book I wanted\nto sort of crack his legacy"},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"in a different way, and that was\none of the reasons for focusing"},"769":{"dur":5,"text":"on his youth in a more empathetic\nnarrative structure of the book."},"774":{"dur":6,"text":"The second one is he, just as a\nthinker and as a person of note"},"780":{"dur":5,"text":"in our history, had a way\nof marrying both the hope"},"785":{"dur":6,"text":"and the aspirational potential of\nhuman beings with a very realistic"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"and almost pessimistic\ntake on our worst sides."},"796":{"dur":5,"text":"And the marriage of hope\nand pessimism, of idealism"},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"and realism is, I think, unmatched\nwith our founding characters."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think it helps explain a\nlot of why we lasted to today."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"So the book tries to get at that."},"811":{"dur":4,"text":"Another reason was we really are in\na crisis today in thinking about,"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"much less realizing, statesmanship."},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"And this book really is about\nMadison as the key architect"},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"of a statesmanship\nethos in our country."},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"Another reason for\nwriting the book was sort"},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"of in noodling on those big ideas."},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"I tripped into what I think is\none of the great untold stories"},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"of our founding period, which is\nthis incredible rivalry he had"},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"with Patrick Henry where they\nhad this -- they were very close,"},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"then they were knock-down-drag-out\nenemies."},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"And they had this battle royale\nover the future of the country"},"847":{"dur":4,"text":"when they had a fight about passing\nthe Constitution in Richmond."},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's the climax of the book."},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"Finally, there was this kind\nof puzzle about how somebody"},"857":{"dur":6,"text":"who was 5'4\", and 100 pounds,\nand incredibly hypersensitive,"},"863":{"dur":5,"text":"and hypochondriacal, and very shy,\nhow could he become so dominant?"},"868":{"dur":4,"text":"It's just kind of in interesting\npuzzle about what was it about him"},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"that allowed him to overcome so many\nobstacles and become so powerful"},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"and influential, not\njust in his time,"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"but over the course of\nmodern human history."},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the last reason\nwas I needed a sequel"},"884":{"dur":3,"text":"to my first book [laughter],\nwhich is called, \"Demagogue.\""},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"So with your indulgence, I'm\ngoing to talk a little bit about"},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Demagogue\" here, and that's\nat the request of some people."},"893":{"dur":1,"text":"It's been a lot in\nthe news recently."},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"I've written pieces for the\nWashington Post, and

in."},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"And it is relevant in,\nand it does connect"},"907":{"dur":1,"text":"to the book \"Becoming Madison.\""},"908":{"dur":2,"text":"So this was \"Demagogue, the

describe"},"929":{"dur":2,"text":"as the demagogue problem\nin democracy."},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"Plato, who after Socrates,\nhis mentor,"},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"was murdered by a democratic\nmob,
