the sky is illuminated by the sun and the\nsun in its all colors, but not equally."},"57":{"dur":3,"text":"The sun doesn\u2019t emit that much red, nor\ndoes it emit that much violet."},"61":{"dur":3,"text":"Most of the light it emits is kind of in the\ngreeny part of the spectrum."},"64":{"dur":5,"text":"Now as you point out, due to Rayleigh scattering\nmore of the shorter wavelengths arte scattered"},"70":{"dur":4,"text":"and that is why the sky looks blue, because\nit is basically the sun\u2019s white spectrum"},"74":{"dur":3,"text":"shifted a little bit towards the blue."},"78":{"dur":1,"text":"This is the spectrum of the blue sky."},"79":{"dur":1,"text":"And, as you can see, it is quite broad."},"81":{"dur":3,"text":"And, in fact, there is a fair amount of violet\nlight in there."},"84":{"dur":4,"text":"But there is not as much violet light as there\nis blue light, because the sunlight that we"},"88":{"dur":3,"text":"started with had much more blue than it has\nviolet."},"91":{"dur":5,"text":">> If I have a lap top on the international\nspace station with a hard disk drive in it,"},"96":{"dur":4,"text":"will the torque from its spinning cause

sooner."},"179":{"dur":4,"text":"So I guess the lesson is don\u2019t fight it."},"183":{"dur":3,"text":"If you want to live longer, just relax and\ngo with it."},"187":{"dur":3,"text":">> You have met

faster"},"218":{"dur":4,"text":"and faster, which makes this kind of a unique\ntime in the history of the earth, because"},"222":{"dur":4,"text":"right now we can still see that there are\nhundreds of

which"},"251":{"dur":5,"text":"means they will be moving relative to us faster\nthan light, if that makes any sense."},"256":{"dur":4,"text":"So their light that they are emitting will\nnever be able to reach us, because it will"},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"never be able to make progress through this\nexpanding space."},"263":{"dur":4,"text":"It is kind of interesting to think about what\nwill happen as that time approaches."},"268":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, the light that is coming from those\ndistant galaxies travels across this expanding"},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"space."},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it becomes red shifted, cosmologically."},"277":{"dur":4,"text":"And eventually the wave length of this light\nwill be so big that its wavelength is the"},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"size of the whole

us."},"299":{"dur":4,"text":"So even though space is expanding on a large\nscale, the gravitational force is enough to"},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"hold all of us together so we will be in it\nfor the long haul."},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"But this still means that there is going to\nbe strange cosmology."},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"If we are still around trillions of years\nfrom now, if we tried to look out, we would"},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"see a very different universe, a universe\nwhich is much emptier than the one we see"},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"today."},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"So we live at a
