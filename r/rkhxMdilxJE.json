one\nin the world has ever"},"489":{"dur":4,"text":"read these 1,000 pages\nthat explain what is in it."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"All you need to know-- and it's\nreally quite important for

a\nlittle bit of a premium to you."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"And we can pass this\nround and we can all"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"make a little bit of profit out\nof passing it on to each

well?"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we can do is we\ncan pass this bit of paper"},"539":{"dur":5,"text":"around until everyone appears\nto have made a profit out of it."},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"Now one day someone is going to\ndiscover that this bit of paper"},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"isn't worth as much\nas people thought."},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"But so long as that\nhasn't yet happened,"},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"we've created a pool\nof imaginary wealth"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"which will benefit\neveryone in the room."},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"Now that's a caricature, but\nnot a very great caricature"},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"of what happened\nbetween 2003 and 2008,"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"which was that\nbanks announced they"},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"had made very large profits,\npaid out a large share of these"},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"to their senior employees, and\nthen announced in 2008 that it"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"had all been a mistake--\nmore or less wiped"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"out bank shareholders--\nand actually, as we know,"},"587":{"dur":4,"text":"needed lots of money from\ntaxpayers to keep them going."},"591":{"dur":4,"text":"Another way of creating\nthis kind of bogus wealth"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"is what I generally\ndescribe as tailgating."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"I have a house in France."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"And those of you who\nhave driven in France"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"will know that if you drive\nin a French

someone"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"who's your tail,\nflashing their lights,"},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"and trying to persuade\nyou to get out of the way."},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"And the thing about

drive"},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"in some kind of sensible,\nmore rational way."},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"One time in 1,000,\nit doesn't work."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"But actually what\nthen happens is"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"that there's a kind of\ncognitive dissonance"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"that separates the\naccident, which"},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"happens one time in\n1,000, from the behavior"},"652":{"dur":6,"text":"of which the other 999\ntimes gave rise to in this."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's always\na reason for that."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the reason\nthere's an accident"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"is that someone else made\na mistake on the road"},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"or there was an obstruction in\nthe way or something like that."},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's always an explanation\nof why this happened."},"671":{"dur":4,"text":"But actually the real\ncause of the accident"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"is the driving behavior\nthat gives rise"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"to it in the first place."},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"But these kind of\nstrategies, by which"},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"you can make sequences of\nsmall profits punctuated"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"by occasional large\nlosses, are characteristic"},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"of a whole variety of\nfinancial market strategies."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"So for a moment\ninstead of talking"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"about what it is that these\nguys in the finance sector do,"},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm going instead to talk about\nwhat finance is actually for."},"705":{"dur":5,"text":"Because let's be quite clear,\neconomies need finance."},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"We need finance really\nfor four kind of purposes."},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"We need finance, first of all,\nto operate a payment system"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"so that we can pay our bills,\nreceive wages and salaries so"},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"that businesses can\ntrade with each other."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"We need finance to help\nus with wealth management."},"728":{"dur":6,"text":"That means we need to transfer\nwealth across our lifetimes"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"because we have education\nwhen we're young,"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"eventually we'll be retired."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"The pattern of earnings\nover our lifetime"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"is different from the\npattern of consumption"},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"we want to maintain."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"We need finance for\ncapital allocation."},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"That is to take the\nsavings of the country"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"and translate them into the\ncapital stock of the country."},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"To take our everyday\nsavings and build"},"758":{"dur":5,"text":"houses and roads and bridges\nand businesses with all of that."},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"And finally, we need finance to\nhelp us with risk mitigation."},"767":{"dur":4,"text":"Finance can help share the risks\nof life among groups of people"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"so that the costs of them don't\nfall in such an extreme way"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"on particular individuals."},"778":{"dur":5,"text":"Now what I try to do in the\nbook, which people have found"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"surprisingly\noriginal in a sense,"},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"is to ask them the question\ninstead of asking what people"},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"in the finance sector\ndo, ask the question,"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"what would a finance\nsector that was devised"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"to meet the needs of the\nreal economy actually"},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"look like in terms of these\nkind of four functions?"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I don't have time to talk\nabout all of that this morning."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I'm going to do is to\nfocus on one of them, which"},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"is actually risk mitigation."},"813":{"dur":4,"text":"And in order to do that,\nI'm going to introduce you"},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"to a rather elegant venue\nin the United States,"},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"which some of you may have\nheard of, called Jackson Hole."},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"Because way back\nin 2005, not long"},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"before the

way in which"},"2344":{"dur":1,"text":"these traditional companies did."},"2346":{"dur":2,"text":"It came to market-- if\nthere was any reason for it"},"2348":{"dur":4,"text":"at all-- to provide

the business\neven though it's"},"2384":{"dur":3,"text":"majority owned by other people."},"2388":{"dur":2,"text":"And the final aspect\nof that is to say"},"2391":{"dur":2,"text":"that we don't, in

institutionalized"},"2400":{"dur":3,"text":"through mutual funds,\npension funds, and the like."},"2404":{"dur":3,"text":"And that means we can have\nmuch more direct

should."},"2415":{"dur":5,"text":"And that would be a more stable\nway of creating and maintaining"},"2420":{"dur":4,"text":"the kind of structure that there\nis in this company where you"},"2425":{"dur":2,"text":"actually have a group\nof investors who"},"2427":{"dur":4,"text":"are happy to sustain the\nkind of founder control"},"2432":{"dur":2,"text":"which is characteristic\nof

issues"},"2458":{"dur":1,"text":"of this business."},"2459":{"dur":2,"text":"Because one other\nimportant aspect of it"},"2462":{"dur":5,"text":"is that a company like\nGoogle doesn't need to own--"},"2467":{"dur":2,"text":"and mostly doesn't\nown-- the assets which"},"2470":{"dur":3,"text":"are used in the businesses\nbecause their office"},"2473":{"dur":4,"text":"blocks, their

election,"},"2519":{"dur":3,"text":"it was pretty interesting when\nMitt Romney disclosed his tax"},"2522":{"dur":3,"text":"rate, which was, I think, around\n12%, because most of his

question is, how do\nyou think governments"},"2542":{"dur":5,"text":"should tax capital income\nversus income from labor?"},"2555":{"dur":2,"text":"JOHN KAY: I think what's\nwrong in the United States"},"2557":{"dur":3,"text":"there is-- and I suspect\nthe main reason Romney paid"},"2561":{"dur":4,"text":"as little tax as he\ndoes is not actually"},"2565":{"dur":2,"text":"to do with lower tax\nrates on capital income"},"2568":{"dur":2,"text":"than on labor income,\nbut to do with the fact"},"2570":{"dur":5,"text":"that there are many more devices\nfor avoiding tax in the

suppose,\nI think, it's clear"},"2601":{"dur":1,"text":"that there's lots\nof things wrong"},"2603":{"dur":2,"text":"and that you'd like to\nchange and lots of people"},"2605":{"dur":0,"text":"would like to change."},"2606":{"dur":4,"text":"But as you alluded to, there's\nnot the political strength"},"2611":{"dur":1,"text":"to do them, partly\nbecause there's"},"2613":{"dur":4,"text":"so much money in the city\nand in Wall Street that stops"},"2617":{"dur":1,"text":"politicians from doing that."},"2618":{"dur":1,"text":"And I suppose that\nstrength would have"},"2620":{"dur":2,"text":"to come from us, the people."},"2623":{"dur":2,"text":"So I wonder, is\nthere a need for us"},"2626":{"dur":3,"text":"to be educated, like\nRob said, to demand that"},"2629":{"dur":0,"text":"from our politicians?"},"2630":{"dur":2,"text":"Because otherwise I feel like\nthat asymmetry of information"},"2633":{"dur":1,"text":"of bankers saying,\nwe know what's"},"2635":{"dur":3,"text":"best, don't get involved, will\nstop us from ever changing."},"2638":{"dur":1,"text":"So do you think that's\nthe reason we need--"},"2640":{"dur":2,"text":"I think you're right, when we\nhave a load of this unfocused,"},"2643":{"dur":1,"text":"as it were, public anger."},"2645":{"dur":3,"text":"I remember going to\nSt Paul's churchyard"},"2649":{"dur":2,"text":"when the Occupy\npeople were in

get"},"2684":{"dur":2,"text":"is what we're seeing\nat the moment, which"},"2686":{"dur":4,"text":"is people who will support\ncrazy guys from whatever parts"},"2691":{"dur":5,"text":"of the political
