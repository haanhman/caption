So inbreeding itself is certainly\nnot necessarily a reason that a group of"},"843":{"dur":6,"text":"humans must go extinct. So that's for\nsure. But of course, if you see a decline"},"849":{"dur":5,"text":"in the size of the population, then you\ncan kind of say, \"Okay, this might be"},"854":{"dur":5,"text":"caused by something.\" And what this\n\"something\" is we don't really know. So it"},"859":{"dur":7,"text":"could be pathogens, or it could be just\nharsh living conditions or just changes in"},"867":{"dur":6,"text":"environment. And I really have to say that\nthere are many different papers that have"},"873":{"dur":6,"text":"actually tried to answer what made\nNeanderthals extinct. I think for me I"},"879":{"dur":7,"text":"have no heard an answer I believe 100%.\nMaybe it's a mixture of different things."},"887":{"dur":7,"text":"- Very nice. We're going to do another one\nnow for Brenna, and then perhaps it will"},"894":{"dur":7,"text":"be time to switch over to the second group\nof speakers. This goes to Brenna. \u201cWe see"},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"a strong drive in humans to spread\nthroughout the world and interact in some"},"906":{"dur":6,"text":"way with archaic species, but there seems\nto be very little back flow into Africa as"},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"evidence by a lack of\nNeanderthal\/Denisovan DNA in African"},"915":{"dur":6,"text":"genome. What factors may have prevented\nback flow of genes into Africa?\u201d"},"926":{"dur":7,"text":"- That's a complex question. There\nactually was a recent paper arguing that"},"933":{"dur":4,"text":"there was gene flow back to Africa,\nspecifically into northeastern Africa and"},"938":{"dur":6,"text":"Ethiopia using an ancient genome. That\npaper is now somewhat controversial due to"},"944":{"dur":8,"text":"some biostatistical mistakes. I actually,\na few years ago, looked at gene flow from"},"953":{"dur":5,"text":"the east into north Africa and one of the\nthings that we did see in that paper, is"},"958":{"dur":6,"text":"that there likely was an event back to\nAfrica approximately 30,000 years ago, or"},"964":{"dur":7,"text":"30 to 40,000 years ago. So I would say\nit's not a closed junction. I think there"},"972":{"dur":4,"text":"have been periods in time that are\nprobably climatically influenced, in which"},"976":{"dur":3,"text":"populations did move back and forth\nbetween the near east and northeastern"},"980":{"dur":5,"text":"Africa.

So the dating for the split"},"1030":{"dur":3,"text":"between what would become modern humans\nand what would become Neanderthals and"},"1033":{"dur":6,"text":"Denisovans, with the Sima de los Huesos\nsample, this has been pushed back in time."},"1040":{"dur":8,"text":"But we thought we had a a reasonably good\nanswer for that with wide error bars, and"},"1049":{"dur":6,"text":"that was up to something like 400,000\nyears ago.

But now we know somehow that must\nhave been, there must have been something"},"1077":{"dur":10,"text":"wrong with that. Where does the discord\ncome from, and is there a chance that we"},"1088":{"dur":7,"text":"find yet another archaic hominid that can\ncause us to revisit this yet again? Is"},"1095":{"dur":6,"text":"this the final answer on the split between\nhuman and things that we are most closely"},"1101":{"dur":8,"text":"related to but they're extinct? And don't\nsay good question."},"1112":{"dur":5,"text":"- I mean, in principle, there is some\nuncertainty there, of course, with the"},"1118":{"dur":5,"text":"dating of the Sima site, also. I mean its\ngenetic evidence and geological evidence"},"1123":{"dur":5,"text":"seem to sort of converge with confidence\ntowards a very large also in this case."},"1129":{"dur":4,"text":"But to give a good answer to this rather\ndetailed question, I think Kay might be a"},"1133":{"dur":5,"text":"better person to do that. As the genetic\nestimates of populations splits, were"},"1139":{"dur":12,"text":"actually sort of described in the Altai\nNeanderthal paper that he first authored,"},"1151":{"dur":2,"text":"so I think he has a chance to explain it\nin better detail."},"1154":{"dur":7,"text":"- So I think Christina might also be in on\nthis question.
