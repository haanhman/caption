what are boundaries?"},"26":{"dur":2,"text":"How do we build them?"},"28":{"dur":4,"text":"How do we heal\nwhen our boundaries are violated?"},"32":{"dur":2,"text":"And how do we push through boundaries?"},"35":{"dur":4,"text":"These questions have been the center\nof my life and my work."},"39":{"dur":3,"text":"When I was a little kid,\nand my world was just my family,"},"43":{"dur":1,"text":"I was pretty sure"},"44":{"dur":3,"text":"we were the only ones struggling\nwith those questions."},"48":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I grew up,\nand I became a family therapist."},"51":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"52":{"dur":3,"text":"And I saw lots of people struggling\nwith these questions."},"55":{"dur":3,"text":"And when I took a detour\nand ran nonprofits,"},"59":{"dur":5,"text":"I saw communities and leaders\nstruggling with these questions."},"65":{"dur":2,"text":"So now I teach workshops and wrote a book"},"67":{"dur":3,"text":"to help people answer these questions."},"71":{"dur":4,"text":"And as people answer these questions\nand learn more about their boundaries,"},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"I've watched hundreds of people\nmake the

committed\nto healthy relationships."},"89":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to share some stories\nand some tools"},"92":{"dur":3,"text":"that you can use\nto strengthen your boundaries."},"96":{"dur":6,"text":"Let's begin with the most essential\nboundary tool that everyone has."},"103":{"dur":3,"text":"Take a moment and visualize\na compass in your hand."},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"It looks just like this."},"110":{"dur":5,"text":"It has two words on it, yes and no,\nand only those two words."},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"You use this compass\nto make your decisions,"},"118":{"dur":1,"text":"figure out your relationships,"},"120":{"dur":3,"text":"and set your boundaries\nfor your whole life."},"123":{"dur":2,"text":"Today I'm going to talk about\nhow you can use this compass"},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"to place boundaries\nwhere you need them the most,"},"130":{"dur":4,"text":"lower your stress,\nand figure out your life's purpose."},"135":{"dur":4,"text":"Now the key to placing boundaries\nwhere you need them the most"},"139":{"dur":3,"text":"is tolerating stormy emotions."},"143":{"dur":3,"text":"I was raised by my grandparents,"},"146":{"dur":4,"text":"and my grandfather had one way\nof doing things: his way."},"151":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"And when I was 24, he came to me,"},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"and he asked me\nto be the executor of his will."},"158":{"dur":4,"text":"And I asked him, \"What was it\nhe wanted me to do after he died?\""},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"And when he told me,\nI got all this stress inside"},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"because there were things\nI didn't want to do"},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"to other family members on his behalf."},"171":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"And I really wanted to please him,"},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"but I couldn't say yes to all this stuff."},"177":{"dur":4,"text":"So I told him, \"No,\"\nI couldn't be his executor."},"182":{"dur":3,"text":"And he did what most people do\nwhen you tell them no."},"186":{"dur":1,"text":"He got angry."},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, when you listen\nto your own yes and no,"},"192":{"dur":5,"text":"other people are going to get angry,\nor they may get disappointed."},"198":{"dur":4,"text":"Boundary setting will unleash emotions,"},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"and yes and no are not feelings."},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"So I couldn't let my fear\nof my grandfather's anger"},"209":{"dur":5,"text":"nor my desire to please him\ndetermine my boundaries."},"214":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, sometimes,\nyour compass is clouded over,"},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"and you can't see if something\nis a yes or a no for you,"},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"and this happens\nif you've been ignoring your compass"},"225":{"dur":4,"text":"or arguing with it\nbecause you don't like what it's saying."},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"Years ago, I wanted to be a writer,"},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was very busy working,\nand I couldn't figure out"},"235":{"dur":4,"text":"how writers made time to write\nand earn a living."},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"So I took this yes,\nand I shoved it to the side."},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"Those are the writers that are here."},"246":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"249":{"dur":4,"text":"And my daughters and I\nwere attending this writing camp,"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"week-long thing for middle schoolers,"},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"and I got to go as a chaperone."},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"And one night,\nthis real writer got on the stage,"},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"and he told us how he made time to write,"},"264":{"dur":3,"text":"what he said yes to with his time\nand what he said no to"},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"in order to complete his books."},"270":{"dur":5,"text":"He lived very cheaply,\nand his sole job was writing."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"There was my answer."},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"So for two years I saved my money,"},"280":{"dur":3,"text":"I lowered my expenses,\nand then, when the time came,"},"284":{"dur":4,"text":"when I had my money saved up,\nI devoted myself to writing."},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"All that work, and in, like,\njust a few short months,"},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"my yes became a no."},"300":{"dur":4,"text":"Writing is a solo sport;\nyou sit alone all day."},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"There I was, talking to my dog."},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Oh, this is not the move for me;\nI'm a people person.\""},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"So I listened to my no."},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"I went back to working with people,"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"and I saved some of my time for writing."},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"That was a much better fit."},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"Now if you pay attention to this compass,"},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"it just gives you the basic guidance,\nthe yes and the no."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn't give you any details."},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to figure out the details."},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"But the thing is,\nyou can trust this compass,"},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"because it's only trying to do one thing,"},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's take care of you."},"345":{"dur":4,"text":"And if you allow your compass\nand your boundaries to take care of you,"},"350":{"dur":4,"text":"it'll mitigate stress,\nand stress is a very serious issue."},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"According to\nthe American Psychological Association,"},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"50 to 58% of us\n- I'm not going to say who --"},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"are suffering from high stress."},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"That's kind of a shocking number."},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"And employers who are listening\nmay want to pay attention to this"},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"and think about how important is\ndecision making on the job,"},"376":{"dur":5,"text":"because this compass\nis highly sensitive to stress,"},"382":{"dur":4,"text":"and stress clouds over your compass."},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"I teach people boundary skills"},"388":{"dur":4,"text":"so that they can reduce and prevent\ntheir stress from accumulating."},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"The challenging thing, though,"},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"is that setting boundaries\nis just a little stressful."},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"It's brief stress, though."},"405":{"dur":4,"text":"Like, once you get over\nthat brief stress of actually doing it,"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"you feel all this relief,"},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"and I call that brief stress \"sweating\"."},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"You're going to do a little sweating\nwhen you set your boundaries."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"I sweat, and I teach this stuff."},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's go back\nto this compass in your hand"},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"that is only trying to take care of you"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"and ask yourself this question:"},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"are there ways\nthat you could improve your self-care?"},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"And when I say self-care,\nmany of you may think first"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"about what you eat\nand how much you exercise,"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"and those are really important,"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"but even people who do those really well"},"449":{"dur":5,"text":"are going to have high stress\nif they aren't managing their boundaries."},"455":{"dur":5,"text":"Self-care is a much bigger landscape\nthan eating and exercise."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"Self-care is how you treat yourself."},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"It's how you find enjoyment, play,"},"466":{"dur":5,"text":"happiness, balance, rest,\nand companionship."},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm the first to admit, though,\nthat self-care can be really hard,"},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"and it took me a long time\nto learn how to do it."},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"In the past, and I like saying \"past\","},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"I was a workaholic caretaker."},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"And back then, I was running an agency"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"that was serving teens who were homeless."},"494":{"dur":5,"text":"It was an agency that I started,\nand I was deeply committed to."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"And over the years,\nas the organization grew,"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"it needed more and more from me."},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"So what if I was up night after night\ntrying to make that budget work?"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"- and I couldn't, a lot of the time."},"516":{"dur":5,"text":"So what if I was on call\n7 days a week, 24 hours a day,"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"year after year after year?"},"526":{"dur":5,"text":"So what if I was getting sick\nfrom watching so much child abuse?"},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"So what if I actually had\npost-traumatic stress from it?"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"I ignored my own care,"},"539":{"dur":4,"text":"until one day, I was sitting\nin this dark movie theater,"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"and I was crying and crying."},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"I broke; I couldn't stop crying,"},"551":{"dur":4,"text":"and I realized something inside\nwas trying to reach me."},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"And as I listened to my tears,"},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"I understood that I couldn't\nkeep running this organization"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"that I started and that I loved."},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"My compass was saying no\nfor my well-being."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"That was really hard to take."},"574":{"dur":4,"text":"My well-being, up against\nall these kids who needed help?"},"579":{"dur":4,"text":"So I dug deep with my compass\nabout my purpose."},"583":{"dur":5,"text":"And I understood that maybe it had been\nmy purpose to start the organization,"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"but ten years later,"},"591":{"dur":5,"text":"the community loved\nand could care for this organization."},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I spent a year\nwith my board of directors,"},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"and we transitioned leadership\nto new leaders for the organization."},"606":{"dur":4,"text":"And I want to tell you\nit's still standing, 24 years now,"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"taking care of kids every day--"},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"(Cheers) (Applause)"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, that's to you guys!"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"(Applause)"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"--every day and every night,"},"622":{"dur":5,"text":"doing exactly what it was designed to do,\nthe way it was designed to do it."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"And I learned from my compass"},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"that other people\ncould take care of the kids,"},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"and the staff, and the organization,"},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"but only I could take care of me."},"642":{"dur":4,"text":"And then I had to face my workaholic."},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh my."},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"My workaholic, she's terrifying;\nshe's worse than my grandfather."},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"655":{"dur":5,"text":"My workaholic never says,\n\"Oh, take a break. You've done enough.\""},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"My workaholic is crazy."},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"And she just keeps going\nand going and going."},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"And I had to intervene\nwith some care for me."},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"And my care for me got better and better,"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"year after year, step by step."},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"Now I challenge myself every day\nto do some of my work"},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"and then do something that I love,\nthat I can fit into each day."},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"So I knit more,\nI hang out with my friends."},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"My friends are kind of shocked\nthat I have time for them."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"My husband and I, we do less chores,"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"and we just have more fun."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"And my daughters and I"},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"are in this ongoing conversation\nabout healthy living,"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"as they both grew up\nand went into healthcare."},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"Go figure."},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"And this summer, on a hot sunny day,"},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"I was watching this eagle\nsoaring overhead at the beach."},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"I remember everything about this day."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"It was a Tuesday, a work day."},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"I had taken my lunch."},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"I drove four minutes\nfrom my office to the beach."},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"And there I was,\ntaking a 45-minute lunch break,"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"watching this eagle\nand listening to the waves."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"Now that's recovery."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I need to warn you."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"Even if you're doing\nall the boundary pieces,"},"747":{"dur":5,"text":"like, you -- you've separated\nyour feelings from your boundaries,"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"and you're doing some good self-care,"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're really listening\nto your yes and no,"},"758":{"dur":5,"text":"and maybe you've recovered\nfrom workaholism or numbing out;"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"even when you do all these pieces\nreally, really well,"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"there are going to be some things"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"that are going to challenge\nyour boundaries,"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're going\nto make things extra hard."},"776":{"dur":5,"text":"None of us are immune to health issues,"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"to a financial crisis,"},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"or to a family member\nwho has an addiction problem."},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"And some of you are dealing\nwith those struggles every day."},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of you are dealing\nwith really tough challenges"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"at your job every day."},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"There are three things that you can do\nto support your compass."},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"First, increase your self-care."},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"You may already be doing some self-care,\nbut you need to step it up."},"809":{"dur":4,"text":"When your loved one has breast cancer,\nwhat I always see is"},"813":{"dur":4,"text":"your care for you goes down\nwhile you care for someone else."},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"And taking that time to care for yourself"},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"may seem completely ridiculous\nin the face of such a big challenge."},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"But I want to see the care for you go up"},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"while you care for someone else"},"831":{"dur":5,"text":"so that you're a stronger support\nin the long run for you and for them."},"837":{"dur":4,"text":"The second thing to do is to reach out\nand build a web of resources."},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"Your compass may not have\nenough information to guide you"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"through the challenge\nthat you're dealing with."},"848":{"dur":5,"text":"We're not all experts in everything;\nfind people who have this expertise."},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"Join a support group, see a therapist,"},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"take a class, reach out."},"860":{"dur":5,"text":"The third thing to do is to really focus\non choosing your responsibilities"},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"and limiting your time during a challenge."},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"During a challenge, we have,\nlike, tons of extra responsibilities"},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"just coming down the hill at us,\nand you can't do it all."},"878":{"dur":3,"text":"You have to decide what you will\nand won't be responsible for,"},"881":{"dur":4,"text":"and you have to let go\nof some of the rest."},"885":{"dur":5,"text":"And nowadays, our technology\nhas created this illusion"},"890":{"dur":5,"text":"that you are all a device\nthat is always on."},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"And now more than ever, you need\nto be careful and be protective"},"900":{"dur":4,"text":"so that you have some time\nto recover during a big challenge,"},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"and times when you're not doing\nongoing problem-solving."},"910":{"dur":4,"text":"All of you are\nin the middle of a life story,"},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"and your story is being shaped"},"918":{"dur":5,"text":"by what you are saying yes to\nand what you are saying--"},"923":{"dur":1,"text":"(Audience) No to."},"925":{"dur":2,"text":"Sarri Gilman: If you shut out\nthe noise and listen,"},"928":{"dur":5,"text":"you're going to find
