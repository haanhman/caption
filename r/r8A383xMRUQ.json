up."},"75":{"dur":4,"text":"But tonight I'm going unplugged, \nI'm going acoustic,"},"80":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm going sans slides, which is really \nkind of scary because the slides are"},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of like my security blanket, \nlike, oh yes, that's what"},"87":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to talk about next."},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm actually going to totally wing this."},"91":{"dur":4,"text":"I had slides prepared but I decided that \nI wanted to get more real with you tonight."},"96":{"dur":3,"text":"Because what I could do is I could get up \nhere and talk about what it's like to"},"99":{"dur":3,"text":"start a company that was Inc. 500 \ntwo years running, that we got"},"103":{"dur":4,"text":"Small Agency of the year, Inc. 30 under

company."},"116":{"dur":4,"text":"What it takes as a human, as a physical \nentity, what it takes as a team."},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's kind of what I want\nto talk about tonight."},"123":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you can bear with me, it's what I \nimagine musicians feel like when"},"127":{"dur":6,"text":"they take away all the remixing on their \nvoices and all the- what is the effect"},"133":{"dur":1,"text":"that they do, it's like [auto-tune noise]"},"135":{"dur":1,"text":"What is it?"},"136":{"dur":0,"text":"You know?"},"137":{"dur":0,"text":"[audience shouts out answer]"},"138":{"dur":1,"text":"Auto-tuning, that's what I'm talking about!"},"139":{"dur":5,"text":"When they take all that away, you're really\nstripped down and raw so go with me on this."},"145":{"dur":5,"text":"So the first thing I want to talk about is \nas a child I was really very curious"},"151":{"dur":7,"text":"and I really loved, I loved nature I loved\nscience and I loved math and I was really"},"158":{"dur":4,"text":"actually very good at math and my mother is \nan accountant and she started teaching me"},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"my multiplication tables and she \nbrought out graph paper,"},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"she brought out spreadsheets because she \nwas always doing stuff with accounting"},"170":{"dur":4,"text":"and then she gave me office supplies and \nthat's how I would keep my time."},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"So I had a little calculator and I had my \nlittle spreadsheet and it reminded me"},"178":{"dur":5,"text":"a lot of that scene in the Royal Tenebaums \nwhen they've got the little kids"},"184":{"dur":6,"text":"crunching numbers so that was me and at a \nvery early age, two things became apparent,"},"190":{"dur":5,"text":"that I was totally a product of my parents\nbecause my father was a general manager"},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"and a business man and my mother was a \nnumbers woman and she loved accounting"},"199":{"dur":3,"text":"and she loved math and then they both loved\nnature and they both loved science"},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"and they encouraged that curiosity."},"204":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I don't have any regrets in my life, \nnone whatsoever but if I did have one,"},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"it would be that I wish someone would have\npulled me aside and said"},"211":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Hey you nerdy girl who's good \nat math, this is how you code.\""},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"Because that's not something I picked up \nuntil much later in life and I feel like"},"219":{"dur":5,"text":"now we're going through a phase in our \neconomy and our education system"},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"and I saw a great campaign \nthe other day out of England"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"called Code is the New Latin."},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"And that really is exciting to me \nbecause I'll tell you right after"},"233":{"dur":4,"text":"I graduated from college, I had no idea \nto be, literally no idea."},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"I spent all this time studying, \nworking hard, getting good grades."},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"That's what I had done for years, I was \njust a product of the system,"},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"getting good grades and then I'm out the \nother side and I thought to myself-"},"246":{"dur":1,"text":"how many of you have seen Madagascar?"},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"The original?"},"249":{"dur":3,"text":"So good, so there's this great scene, \nChris Rock playing the zebra,"},"253":{"dur":5,"text":"on the treadmill in Central

man?\""},"263":{"dur":4,"text":"And he's like \"I don't know, like maybe \ngo back to Africa, maybe go to law school.\""},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"And that was kind of what I thought, \nmaybe I'll go to law school"},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"because that's what smart people \nare supposed to do,"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"they're supposed to be lawyers but if you\nthink about the per capita,"},"276":{"dur":5,"text":"there's some crazy ratio that 1 out of \nevery 250 people in California are lawyers."},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't know, I'm making that up but \nsomething intense and crazy like that"},"284":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's a very saturated field \nand it's also a field that isn't"},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"building something right?"},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"How many engineers do we have \nin the room tonight?"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"Hey whoa, look at that."},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"How many designers?"},"297":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, how many operational project manager\nbusiness side, sales, marketing?"},"302":{"dur":6,"text":"Okay, so it's a good blend of all three of \nthose things and I love seeing so many more"},"308":{"dur":5,"text":"engineers and designers and hearing \nGitHub is just an inspiring space"},"314":{"dur":6,"text":"but thinking about when you were growing \nup what kind of opportunities were there?"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought, you know, I could be an \nastronaut, I could be a teacher,"},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"I could be a doctor, talked to some friends\nfrom Germany Sebastian and Mark tonight."},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"In Germany they're much more vocationally\ndriven so what they do is they pair"},"332":{"dur":4,"text":"industry with actual university so when you\ngraduate you have much more of a sense of"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"what you're going to do when you grow up."},"338":{"dur":5,"text":"So here I was graduating, thought I'd be a \nlawyer so I went and I worked at a law firm."},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"Now if anybody's ever worked a law firm \nand a big law firm, they're pretty much"},"347":{"dur":5,"text":"soul-crushing, I mean all you're doing all \nday is making copies, so many copies."},"353":{"dur":4,"text":"There's a great scene in Life is Beautiful \nwith Roberto Benigni, he's carrying"},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"the anvil and he says \"Why so many anvils?"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's what I was, \"Why so many copies?\""},"362":{"dur":4,"text":"But I just kept making the copies and while \nI was there, I had a great thing happen."},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"I learned all about source code."},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"And I learned about source code because \nthere were all these meta-data trademark"},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"violations of our clients."},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"So my job was literally to go in and either\nscreenshot the violation or in some cases"},"381":{"dur":4,"text":"print all the source code out, put it in \na folder then I would go on to"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"the USPTO's website and find the violation, \nthen I would take the violation"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"and put it in a big spreadsheet because \nmy mom taught me all about spreadsheets"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"when I was little and then I would do \none of those mail merges."},"395":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, that's kind of old school but how \nmany of you all have done a mail merge?"},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"Hey, I like that, I like that."},"401":{"dur":5,"text":"Mail merges are really just a test of your \npatience and you get one thing wrong"},"406":{"dur":6,"text":"and all of a sudden the trademark goes into \n\"Dear USPTO 987521\" and you're like"},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"\"No, that's not who I wanted.\""},"414":{"dur":5,"text":"So I did that for a while but in that time\nI realized- and it was 2005, 2006,"},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"so it wasn't like the Internet was this \nnew thing but this idea of managing"},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"your brand online was new and the idea that \nbrands actually realized that it wasn't"},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"just about having your .com but there were \npeople doing phishing scams."},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"They were creating- I was working with \nthe Choice Hotel family so Comfort Inn,"},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"Sleep Inn, very generic names like couldn't\nyou have come up with something better?"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"But at any rate, lots of people were \njacking the name and then creating"},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"websites that looked just like their \nwebsite and then taking people's"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"credit card numbers."},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"So I was documenting these violations \nand along the way I met"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"an incredible mentor at that company."},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is where I really kind of want \nto hit the pause button."},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not really about the law that I was \nexcited or it wasn't really about"},"459":{"dur":4,"text":"my first job but it was about this mentor \nthat I had that believed in me"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"and I hope everybody in this room- \nbecause I see mostly people"},"466":{"dur":7,"text":"in their maybe twenties, thirties, maybe a\nfew people older than that but serve the"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"people around you by being a great mentor."},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"Be that lighthouse."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"Julie is a great lighthouse for \nthis community right?"},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"She's making sure to amplify and bring in\nmore women in the technology industry."},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"But this particular mentor, Dave Grice, \nI looked to him, not because he was"},"486":{"dur":4,"text":"the best lawyer, although he's very good, \nbut I loved the way he treated his team."},"490":{"dur":5,"text":"He treated everyone with such respect that \njust because you were a paralegal or"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"a first year attorney, you weren't going \nto be treated like less than a person."},"500":{"dur":5,"text":"And later on in my career I've worked with \nassholes, like I worked with straight-up"},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"bona fide, people who are just mean \nand people who treat others"},"510":{"dur":4,"text":"with disrespect and I thought well, they're\nadults, why are adults acting this way?"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"It turns out, if they're an asshole when \nthey're younger, they'll probably grow up"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"and they'll be adult assholes."},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"[Laughter from audience]"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"I have a policy, no more working with \npeople like that but this particular"},"524":{"dur":4,"text":"person was so far from that and he \ncultivated such an incredible team"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"that we were a unit and we worked together."},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I took away from Dave was not only\nthat but there was something else that I"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"really loved about the business of law."},"537":{"dur":4,"text":"And that was business development, I loved\ncoming up with these ideas of how"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"we were going to win these big clients, \nso it meant slides, so again,"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"keep talking about \"look all these slides \nI've done\", I've no slides tonight."},"548":{"dur":4,"text":"But I love the slides and I loved coming up \nwith that narrative of how we were going"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"to help that company, some of the things \nthat we saw as challenges,"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"some of the ideas we had as a result."},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I took away from that job- \nyes, it was some Internet stuff,"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"yes, it was looking at source code for the \nfirst time but it was really about"},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"how to treat people and then how \nto cultivate a narrative"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"and convince and persuade an audience."},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"So I ended up moving jobs after that,\ndeciding I don't want to be a lawyer"},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"but now what do I want to be so I \ntapped into my alumni network"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"because I thought, hopefully there will be \npeople there that might want to give me"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"a job and I found this company \nand I kid you not,"},"585":{"dur":6,"text":"they quoted Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, Hobbes, \nLocke and Marx, which are all people"},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"that I'd read growing up and in \ncollege and they were a"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"crisis communication company."},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"And most crisis people, if you hear \nspin masters, they'll say"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"\"This is an opportunity.\""},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Crisis is an opportunity.\""},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"And these people were really pragmatic."},"607":{"dur":4,"text":"They said, \"A crisis is something we're \ngoing to try to make less bad.\""},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, yes!"},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"I like the way you think!"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"And I like that they embraced human nature."},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's another theme I want to emphasize"},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"is that whatever you're building,"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"whatever you're thinking, whatever you're\ntrying to convince audiences of or even"},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"just your coworkers trying to rally around, \nalign it to human nature."},"628":{"dur":4,"text":"Trying to have people do something outside \nof their comfort zone, yes it's good,"},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"yes, you can educate people but all in all,\nI've always been the most successful"},"636":{"dur":5,"text":"because when I figured out what motivates \nyou or what motivates you and then align it"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"with the overall business \nobjective that I have."},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"Sometimes it's money but often times, \nit's not, it's spaces like this."},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"It's being treated with respect."},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"It's about having flexible work hours."},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"It's about being able to do cool stuff \nwith other smart cool people."},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's something as an entrepreneur, \nyou're trying to figure out not only what"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"your product market fit is and making sure \nyou have enough funds in the bank to do"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"payroll but you're also trying to think how\ncan I motivate the people at my company,"},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"on my team to do their best work and create\nan environment to do that?"},"672":{"dur":6,"text":"So I work in crisis communications and they \nhave me on the Internet Watch Team"},"678":{"dur":0,"text":"and by team, it's just me."},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"And most companies are built like a pyramid, \nwith all the worker bees and then"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"the middle managers and then the VPs \nand then the head of the company."},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"Well this company inverted that model\nand they built it with a bunch of"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"senior people who are very connected, I was \nin Washington D.C. so a lot of people"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"that were former press secretaries \nand people that had worked on"},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"the Hill and done cool stuff and at the \nvery fulcrum of that funnel that was me."},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"And I was there working on my spreadsheets, \nback in the good old days before Radian 6"},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"we hand collected data from the Internet \nso I would go out online,"},"708":{"dur":4,"text":"I would do my searches and I would \npull back my data and analyze it."},"712":{"dur":6,"text":"Then I would tell clients like Splenda \nand Purdue who has Oxycontin,"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"I would analyze all the conversations or as\nmany as I could get my hands on,"},"721":{"dur":5,"text":"a good sample set, what was being said \nabout them and when I was working there"},"727":{"dur":5,"text":"I realized that gosh the Internet, \nthere's a lot of chatter out there,"},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot of conversations being had, \nacross a lot of different demographics."},"735":{"dur":4,"text":"So I went to my boss, I said there's a lot \nmore that we could be doing here."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"We could actually create a whole service \nline, a whole product, a whole-"},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"frankly a technology that could automate \nwhat I'm doing- now again I'm not"},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"giving myself credit for the Radian 6 and \nthe online brand management tools"},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"but I saw early on that it was \nsomething important."},"754":{"dur":4,"text":"So my boss, very smart man, at the top of \nthis inverted pyramid thing."},"759":{"dur":6,"text":"He said to me, the Internet is something \nthat we like to watch for our clients"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's just a bunch of bloggers in their \npajamas in their parents' basement."},"769":{"dur":5,"text":"And he drew a picture, here's what matters \nand he showed cable news and print"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"and all of that and he said \nand here's the blogosphere."},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"It just, it doesn't really matter and \nhe almost metaphorically patted me"},"781":{"dur":4,"text":"on the head and sent me on my way \nand within two months something"},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"radical happened on the blogosphere \nthat summer and if anybody remembers"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"that summer of 2006?"},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"2006?"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"Macaca."},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"And that was a moment where George Allen,\nSenator at the time of Virginia,"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"would be Republican nominee for President"},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"decided that it would be a good idea to use \na racial slur at a gentleman who was"},"809":{"dur":5,"text":"tracking him- so there are trackers that \nfollow candidates from the opposing team,"},"814":{"dur":5,"text":"opposing side- and a good friend of mine, \nBen Tribbett on his blog, not Larry Sabato"},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"broke the story."},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"Washington Post had their hands on it but \nthey decided not to run with it"},"824":{"dur":5,"text":"but Ben decided to run with it and at that \nmoment it completely shifted the narrative"},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"around George Allen, it ruined \nhis political career"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"and also the blogosphere went from being\nthis thing in the basement"},"836":{"dur":4,"text":"with your parents over there to being \nsomething that drove the mainstream."},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"And that would become what we know now \ntoday as something that's just intertwined."},"845":{"dur":4,"text":"I was watching CNN Tonight and they kept \nquoting BuzzFeed, I was like really?"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"But of course, Ben Smith is there and he's \ndoing some really great reporting,"},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"he's building a great team."},"854":{"dur":4,"text":"So looking at that moment, I'm sure we've \nall had that, when a boss or someone"},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"doesn't believe in us, like pat us on \nour head and send us on our way."},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"And I knew better, I knew better."},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"I knew I need to break through that and \nit wasn't because I was a woman"},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"but it was my age, I mean there was \ndefinitely \"hey you're 23 years old,"},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"what do you know about \ncrisis communications?\""},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"\"We've been doing this for 25 years.\""},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"So I decided I had to keep moving \nand that's something else"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll find in your career, that if you do\nhit walls, it's good to try"},"882":{"dur":4,"text":"to break them down but if you do find that\nyou're stagnating, all of you in this room,"},"886":{"dur":4,"text":"everyone in freaking San Francisco is so \ntalented and so skilled that it does"},"891":{"dur":4,"text":"make sense that being able to move forward \nand move on is okay, I'll talk about"},"895":{"dur":4,"text":"when to stick it out and persevere in my \nChapter 2 in just a second."},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"So here I am looking for a new job, going \nback to my alumni network because"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"it worked the last time."},"906":{"dur":5,"text":"This time, I end up getting introduced to \na very difficult personality that I'm glad"},"911":{"dur":4,"text":"I worked with, a very curmudgeon \ngentleman named John McLaughlin."},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"If anybody has seen the McLaughlin Group \nwith Pat Buchanan, Clarence Page,"},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"Eleanor Clift, it's a classic political \nshow where they sit in a circle"},"922":{"dur":1,"text":"and yell at each other,"},"923":{"dur":0,"text":"two Repubicans,"},"924":{"dur":1,"text":"two Democrats."},"925":{"dur":2,"text":"He in fact invented that format."},"927":{"dur":4,"text":"He's like older than time and it was great\nworking for him because he was independent."},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"He did not have NewsCorp or Hearst \nor anybody over him."},"937":{"dur":4,"text":"He bought his own time on NBC in \nNew York and in Washington D.C."},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"and then he syndicated it out through PBS."},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"So on the one hand, I loved \nthe independence and the idea"},"947":{"dur":3,"text":"of pursuing ideas for the sake of ideas \nand not because we had some sort of agenda."},"951":{"dur":3,"text":"On the other hand, he was crazy."},"954":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm talking bona fide, crazy."},"957":{"dur":1,"text":"We would have a loudspeaker."},"959":{"dur":3,"text":"Imagine my voice booming throughout \nthe day, saying Natasha bring it down."},"963":{"dur":1,"text":"And you're like \"Bring what down?\""},"964":{"dur":1,"text":"And you're all of a sudden grabbing \neverything at your

Columbia."},"976":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Yes Dr. McLaughlin\", and you put all of \nyour papers out and paper, paper,"},"980":{"dur":1,"text":"give me paper."},"982":{"dur":3,"text":"So we'd give him paper and we'd go through \nthe paper and you know \"Ugh...\""},"985":{"dur":5,"text":"And he'd draw it out and then this is good, \nno this isn't good and he would tear it up"},"991":{"dur":5,"text":"and go on just like that for a long time \nand it was chaotic because it was"},"997":{"dur":4,"text":"his personality and it was a daily, it felt \nlike a daily show but it was a weekly show."},"1001":{"dur":3,"text":"It was only 22 minutes and we're like\n\"Dr. McLaughlin, we shouldn't really"},"1004":{"dur":4,"text":"start the show until Thursday because all \nthe

months."},"1015":{"dur":2,"text":"He would turn over as many \nas five people a day."},"1018":{"dur":4,"text":"We would call- we had Randstad on triple\nspeed dial and we would just send more"},"1023":{"dur":1,"text":"bodies down to help right?"},"1025":{"dur":2,"text":"And I learned from that."},"1027":{"dur":3,"text":"There's such a huge cost in

back to some of those early days of\nhand-collecting those conversations"},"2120":{"dur":3,"text":"online and trying to inform brands of \nwhat people were saying about

activating"},"2436":{"dur":1,"text":"and finding people's passion areas."},"2438":{"dur":3,"text":"But if I start adding like, I also want to \nbe the best at marketing and be the

you know grow into the type"},"2461":{"dur":2,"text":"of professional that you want to be or \nthe leader that you are?"},"2464":{"dur":2,"text":"[Leslie] The first thing I love \nthinking about is mentorship"},"2467":{"dur":1,"text":"across three axes."},"2468":{"dur":2,"text":"The first is going to be a role model."},"2471":{"dur":1,"text":"And a role model is somebody that's \ngoing to be your rockstar,"},"2472":{"dur":2,"text":"like Marissa Mayer and Sheryl Sandberg, \nif there was a poster of them,"},"2475":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd have them on up on my

having more \nrole models at the C-Suite and at"},"2494":{"dur":4,"text":"the highest levels of design, development, \noperations and business"},"2499":{"dur":1,"text":"is incredibly important."},"2500":{"dur":1,"text":"I think the other thing across that axis,"},"2502":{"dur":2,"text":"so you have role models \nand you have mentors."},"2504":{"dur":3,"text":"Mentors are people that are in \nyour industry and have at least"},"2507":{"dur":3,"text":"I would say ten to twenty years \nof experience above what you do,"},"2511":{"dur":3,"text":"and bring perspective and help you \nthink about things in a way"},"2514":{"dur":1,"text":"that you're not currently thinking about."},"2516":{"dur":1,"text":"Now there's reverse mentorship."},"2517":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of people that I've worked with were \ntwenty, thirty years older than me"},"2520":{"dur":4,"text":"and in return, I'd teach them things like \nSkype, Cloud computing, Google Docs,"},"2525":{"dur":2,"text":"texting, Emoji, you know?"},"2528":{"dur":3,"text":"Seriously, that was what I would do \nand then their kids are like,"},"2531":{"dur":1,"text":"Mom you're so cool, you use Emoji."},"2533":{"dur":4,"text":"And the third kind of mentorship \nand this is the one that Dave Grice"},"2537":{"dur":2,"text":"was for me at that law firm, is a sponsor."},"2539":{"dur":4,"text":"Get yourself a sponsor, first thing to do \ntomorrow is figure out who is your sponsor."},"2544":{"dur":3,"text":"Your sponsor is going to have two levels \nabove you in the organization."},"2547":{"dur":4,"text":"If you're a start-up, then it has to be\nsomeone as senior as you possibly can get,"},"2551":{"dur":3,"text":"if it's a small team and that sponsor is \nsomeone that you're going to say,"},"2554":{"dur":2,"text":"hey, I need your help politically blocking\nand tackling- the bigger the organization,"},"2557":{"dur":3,"text":"the more politics plays into \nyour advancement more than"},"2561":{"dur":2,"text":"your actual qualifications, as much\nas we hate to admit it."},"2564":{"dur":3,"text":"It's about seeing the opportunities \nand knowing when those emerge."},"2567":{"dur":2,"text":"Because oftentimes those are discussed \nin closed-door meetings"},"2569":{"dur":4,"text":"that those sponsor people are in \nand sponsoring them also means"},"2574":{"dur":2,"text":"advocating for them."},"2576":{"dur":4,"text":"Sitting down, saying I want to- Julie has \nwhat it takes, Leslie has what it takes"},"2581":{"dur":2,"text":"to take on this role."},"2583":{"dur":1,"text":"Well you know she doesn't yet \nhave this area."},"2585":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, I'll help her through that."},"2586":{"dur":3,"text":"And I would want to make sure that \nshe gets this new position."},"2589":{"dur":2,"text":"So role model, mentor, sponsor."},"2592":{"dur":1,"text":"Figure out who yours are."},"2594":{"dur":3,"text":"And then for me, I

way that I wanted to emulate \nand in the case of the gal who"},"2609":{"dur":4,"text":"I brought in to help me navigate leaving \nJess3, she had brought her team"},"2613":{"dur":4,"text":"from 2 to 1500 globally and at the time \nJess3 was running a very global,"},"2618":{"dur":3,"text":"almost like a supply-chain company \nbecause we had so many contractors"},"2621":{"dur":4,"text":"in so many

networking within that world."},"2656":{"dur":4,"text":"Two, it comes down also to, when money \nchanges hands, that's when boards either"},"2661":{"dur":4,"text":"get built or get added to so as people are \nraising rounds and looking at that,"},"2666":{"dur":1,"text":"know that piece of it."},"2667":{"dur":4,"text":"And three, making sure that \nyou're letting people know"},"2672":{"dur":1,"text":"you're interested in that position."},"2674":{"dur":3,"text":"In the next couple of years, I'm going to \ncall it my letter writing

senior leaders"},"2690":{"dur":3,"text":"at the Fortune 500 companies, Fortune 5000\ncompanies I eventually want to work with,"},"2694":{"dur":2,"text":"so positioning yourself, if that's \nsomething you do want to go after"},"2697":{"dur":2,"text":"and if anybody does want to talk about\nthat because that's something I feel that"},"2699":{"dur":3,"text":"especially women, there's just not enough

someday but you \njust don't know how to"},"2738":{"dur":1,"text":"get out that information."},"2739":{"dur":1,"text":"So whether it's boards or other things, \nI think there are network
