to know what"},"114":{"dur":2,"text":"inspired you to write a book."},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"And with this book\nwhat inspired me"},"119":{"dur":4,"text":"was doubt, or\nskepticism, or mistrust,"},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"whatever you want to call it."},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"Because a few years\nago I was reading"},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"about someone who\nsuffered a brain injury,"},"130":{"dur":5,"text":"and his behavior changed in this\nreally drastic way after it."},"135":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was reading\nthis story and I just"},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"said to

there's no way\nthat can possibly be true."},"162":{"dur":4,"text":"So I set out to try to\ndisapprove these stories"},"166":{"dur":3,"text":"and I ended up, in the\nend, proving myself wrong."},"170":{"dur":1,"text":"These stories were true."},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"But I realized that they offered\nkind of an interesting insight"},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"into the way the brain works."},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"So what kind of\nstories were these?"},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, I'm sure we've all heard\nstories of people getting"},"182":{"dur":4,"text":"injured and then they\nlose the ability to speak,"},"186":{"dur":1,"text":"or their memory\ngoes on the blink,"},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"or they're paralyzed in part of\ntheir body, things like that."},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"So it wasn't stories like\nthat, because I'd already"},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"heard things like that."},"194":{"dur":1,"text":"Instead these were\nstories about things"},"196":{"dur":4,"text":"they were very startlingly\nspecific talents"},"200":{"dur":1,"text":"that people lost."},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"For instance, I think we\nall know generally

still tell\nplants apart just fine."},"228":{"dur":3,"text":"They can recognize different\npeople's faces no problem."},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"But elephants, dogs, raccoons,\nturtles, whatever, they all"},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"look exactly the same to them."},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"They cannot tell\nthese animals apart."},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"Or kind of the opposite\nthing can happen."},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe some people can\nrecognize animals just fine,"},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"but all knowledge of plants\njust sort of-- poof--"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"disappears out of their mind."},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"And what's going on here\nis that our ancestors way,"},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"way back when, some people\nwere better than others"},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"at recognising and\nremembering certain animals,"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"certain plants,\nthings like that."},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"And it turns out the people who\nwere really good at

these animals are"},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"good companions."},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"Those people kind\nof had an advantage"},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"over the people who\nwere bad at

plants\ngot hard wired into our brain."},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"It gave those people\na big advantage."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"But the downside of\nhaving the hard wiring"},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"is that if that spot of\nthe brain gets injured,"},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"that knowledge\ncan just disappear"},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're going to\nhave a deficit suddenly."},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's what kind of was\ngoing on with these people."},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, kind of giving an insight\ninto how the brain evolved,"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"a little bit about its history."},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"The other story\nI heard I thought"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"was maybe even a\nlittle stranger."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, we've all heard\nstories about people who've"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"been injured in one\npart of their brain"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"and suddenly they lose\nthe ability to speak."},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"They just can't form\nwords, can't get"},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"sentences out of them."},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"But sometimes what's\nactually

that\nconnect the language centers"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"to the mouth, the teeth,\nthe tongue, and the lips."},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"So again, the\nlanguage center is OK."},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"It's that the wires sending\nthe information are broken."},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"But one thing you learn\nabout neuroscience"},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"when you start reading\nis that there's"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of different\nways for information"},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"to move around in the brain."},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a lot of back\nalleys, a lot of detours,"},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"things like that."},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"Information can go through\na lot of different routes."},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"So sometimes the\ndirect connection"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"is broken but there\nare back alleys"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"that the information can take."},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"Specifically, there\nare back alleys"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"that go from the\nlanguage centers"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"to the emotional\ncenters of the brain,"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"and from the emotional\ncenters they can still"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"access the teeth, the\ntongue, and the lips."},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"So when you're talking\nto these people"},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"where the direct\nconnection's broken"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"but this back route through\nthe emotions is still there,"},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"you try to engage\nthem in conversation,"},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"they just can't\nget the words out."},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"They're just\nstruggling to speak."},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you provoke\nthem, you get them mad,"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"you start to rile\nthem up a little bit,"},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"they can swear at you just fine."},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"They'll say you\nbeepity-beep-beep,"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"and then, you know, they'll\nsort of grab their mouth"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"because in a lot of\ncases they didn't even"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"realize that they\ncould swear like this."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"It just sort of bubbles up\nout of them unconsciously."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"Another thing that can\nhappen, very similar,"},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"is there are connections\nsometimes between the language"},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"centers, the parts of the\nbrain that process music,"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"and from there it can get\nto the teeth, the tongue,"},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"and the lips."},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"And with these people\nthey can't speak again"},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"but they can sing\nsong lyrics just fine."},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"An example of this was\nGabrielle Giffords,"},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"the Congresswoman from Arizona."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"A few years ago after\nshe got shot in the head,"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"she lost the ability to\nspeak, but she could still"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"sing a lot of song lyrics."},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"She was singing songs like\n\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun.\""},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"And I don't know why Cindy\nLauper was the song that"},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"ended up sticking in her\nhead, but she actually"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"re-learned,\nre-taught herself how"},"449":{"dur":4,"text":"to speak by practicing\nsinging these song lyrics over"},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"and over again."},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was sitting there thinking\nto myself one day like, wow."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"I bet you could write a whole\nhistory of the brain just sort"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"of based on these\ndifferent injuries"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"and what each one teaches you\nabout how the brain works,"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"what that part does, et cetera."},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"And then sort of the\ncartoon light bulb"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"went off over my head and\nI said, oh boy, you know,"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"I should write a book like that."},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"That would be a lot of fun."},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"And so that's where\nthis book came from,"},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"was trying to prove those\nother stories wrong, but not"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"only proving that\nthey were correct"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"but finding out that it had\na lot of interesting things"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"to say about the\nhistory of the brain."},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"Because until the\npast few decades or so"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"there really only was one\nway to study the brain."},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"You had to wait for injuries to\nstrike people and then see how"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"their minds changed afterward."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"Sometimes these were tumors\nor gun shots, lobotomies"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"that went wrong, rabies\ninfections, all these sorts"},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"of different things."},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"And there were some really\nmiraculous tales of recovery"},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"out there."},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"But if people's bodies\nrecovered, their minds didn't."},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"At least not quite."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"Because there was often\nsomething a little off,"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"something a little unusual\nabout the people afterward."},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"Some people started\nlying incessantly,"},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"some people lost\nall fear of death,"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"parents suddenly couldn't\nrecognize their children"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"anymore."},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"But in each case it gave\na very important clue"},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"about what that specific\narea of the brain did."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"And basically all of\nthe major breakthroughs"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"in the history of\nneuroscience came about"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"because of these sorts of cases."},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"And stories are probably more\nimportant to neuroscience"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"than maybe any other\nscientific field out there."},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm happy to be able to share\na few of those stories with you"},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"this afternoon."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're going to start with\nsomething sort of visceral,"},"563":{"dur":4,"text":"kind of a basic brain\nfunction, and that is emotions."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"So here's a picture of\nsomething that, if you saw it--"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"or if you actually saw\nthis in real life--"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"it would probably\ncause an emotion"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"to rise up inside of you."},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"So just a quick overview of\nsome of the emotional structures"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"And don't worry too much about\nall the details, but just"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"a quick overview."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"If a big tiger jumped\nup in front of you"},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"like this, first thing\nthat would happen,"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"obviously, is your\neyes, your ears,"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"your senses would take\nin the information"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"and they would send it to a\nstructure in the center there"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"called the thalamus, the big\noval, the yellow oval there"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"in the middle."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"The thalamus is\nreally a relay center."},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"It takes information\nin and starts"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"sending it to other parts of\nthe brain for more processing."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the places it\nsends the information"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"is to the hippocampus,\nthe long green thing"},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"going around the outside."},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll talk a little bit\nmore about that later,"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"but the hippocampus\nis basically involved"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"with forming and\nstoring memories."},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"That's its basic role."},"622":{"dur":5,"text":"Another place the thalamus sends\ninformation is to the amygdala."},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"The amygdala is\ninvolved in processing"},"629":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of different emotions,\nbut its basic job is to say, OK,"},"634":{"dur":0,"text":"so what?"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"There's something\nin front of me."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm getting some information\nabout it, but so what?"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"Should I care about\nthis thing or not?"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"And in this case the amygdala\nis going to say, OK, you know,"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"there's this big\ncat in front of me."},"646":{"dur":0,"text":"It's growling."},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"It's starting to run at me."},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"It's probably something I\nshould care about right now."},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's going to\nsend information"},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"to another structure called the\nhypothalamus, the purple thing"},"656":{"dur":0,"text":"there."},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"And what the\nhypothalamus does is"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"it's really kind\nof the interaction"},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"between the brain the body."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"So the hypothalamus is going to\ngive you a shot of adrenaline."},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"It's going to make\nyou want to run away."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"It's going to make you\nwant to do something"},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"with that information."},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's other parts\nof the brain that"},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"do get involved with\nemotions, but that's"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of a basic overview\nof the limbic system,"},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of how the emotional\ncenters in the brain work."},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"But because these are\norganic brain structures,"},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"if you suffered damage\nto one of these parts"},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"this process can go awry."},"691":{"dur":5,"text":"And this story of one of these\nemotional centers going awry"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"involves a woman who\nwas born in Iowa."},"699":{"dur":5,"text":"She was growing up there in the\n1960s, and when she was young"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"she had perfectly normal\nemotional responses."},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"In particular, she had a\nperfectly normal fear response."},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"So for instance,\nwhen she was young"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"she was at her\nneighbor's house one day"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"and she remembered\na doberman came out"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"and it kind of cornered\nher in the kitchen."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"Her heart started pounding,\nher throat went dry."},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"Pretty typical fear response."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"But at about the\nage of nine or ten"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"she came down with\nthe very rare disease"},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"that ended up destroying both\nof the amygdala in her brain."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"She was left with what\nher doctors described"},"739":{"dur":4,"text":"as two black holes where\nher amygdala should be."},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"And basically since that point\nshe has not felt a lick of fear"},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"in her life."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"And studies involving\nthis woman--"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"in the medical literature\nshe's known as SM."},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm just going to call her\nSarah, just to kind of give her"},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"a name."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"But stories involving\nSarah are actually"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of a hoot to read\nabout because they basically"},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"involve scientists\ntrying to think up"},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"ever-more-elaborate\nways to frighten her."},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"So for instance, one time\nthey decided, well, you know,"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"we're going to drive\nher to this pet store."},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to expose her\nto some spiders and snakes,"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"see how she reacts to that."},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, on the drive to the\npet store Sarah was saying,"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"you know, I'm not\nreally that into snakes."},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't think I'm going to like\nthis whole experience a lot."},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"But once she got\nthere she practically"},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"jumped out of the car, ran\ninside, grabbed the snake out"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"of the clerk's hand, let\nit wrap itself around her."},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"She started playing with it."},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, she was\nhaving a good time."},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"And the part I remember reading\nabout that was really startling"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"was that the snake--\nit was, like,"},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"flicking its tongue at her."},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"And every time it tried to\nflick its tongue at her,"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"Sarah was trying to grab\non to the snake's tongue,"},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"like trying to time\nit and grab it."},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"And I admit, I'm\nno reptile expert,"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"but I'm pretty\nsure snakes do not"},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"like having their tongues\ngrabbed like that."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"They don't respond well to that."},"822":{"dur":0,"text":"But she didn't care."},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"She was having fun and just\nplaying with this snake."},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"Another thing they\ntried to do is"},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"they tried to bring\nto this haunted house."},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"It was in an old lunatic asylum."},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"There were a lot of dark corners\nand creaking floorboards,"},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"pretty spooky."},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"They matched her up with five\nother women about her age"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"as kind of a control\ngroup and they sent her"},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"through this haunted house\nto see what would happen."},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"And the other women, they were\nkind of ducking their eyes,"},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"they would scream\nevery once in a while."},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, pretty typical\nresponses in a haunted house."},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"But Sarah didn't care."},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"Sarah would look at\nin and kind of go, eh,"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"and then kind of wander\nahead, kind of wandering into"},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"places she shouldn't have been,\npoking her nose into areas."},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"And toward the end of the\ntrip through the haunted house"},"864":{"dur":1,"text":"this monster jumped out."},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"It was an actor in a\ncostume, obviously."},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"But a monster jumped\nout and said, rawr,"},"870":{"dur":1,"text":"and tried to scare her."},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"And Sarah didn't blink, she\njust kind of looked at it."},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"But she got kind of\ncurious because it"},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"had kind of this bloody\ngoo on the side of its mask"},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"and she wanted to know\nwhat it felt like,"},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"so she started walking\ntoward the monster."},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"Then she kind of lunged at it."},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"And she actually ended\nup scaring the monster,"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"because he didn't expect\nto get backed down"},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"into a corner in this\nlittle haunted house."},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"So every test they would\nrun her through they"},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"could not find any\nsituation where she looked"},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"like she was feeling fear."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"But they want to be good\nscientists about this"},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"so they said, well, let's\nexplore some other things."},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"One thing they wanted\nto make sure of-- she's"},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"obviously not showing fear,\nbut maybe she's just sort of"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"blunted to all emotions."},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe fear is just\nan obvious one,"},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"but maybe she really can't\nfeel any emotions very well."},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"So what they did is they started\nshowing her a bunch of

step."},"1162":{"dur":3,"text":"She was locking her\nattention onto things."},"1165":{"dur":2,"text":"Because if you remember\nat the snake store"},"1167":{"dur":1,"text":"or at the haunted\nhouse, it's not"},"1169":{"dur":1,"text":"like she was just\nindifferent to these things"},"1171":{"dur":2,"text":"where she was like, OK,\na snake or a monster,"},"1174":{"dur":1,"text":"she was fascinated\nwith these things"},"1175":{"dur":3,"text":"and she was really locking her\nattention onto these things."},"1178":{"dur":1,"text":"Which is important if\nyou think about it,"},"1180":{"dur":2,"text":"because our ancestors\nway back when--"},"1183":{"dur":2,"text":"if a snake went slithering\nthrough the grass"},"1185":{"dur":1,"text":"or something like that\nthey wanted to make sure"},"1187":{"dur":1,"text":"they paid close\nattention to that."},"1189":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't want to\nfind a deadly snake"},"1190":{"dur":2,"text":"and then get distracted by a\nmonkey or a cloud or something"},"1193":{"dur":0,"text":"like that."},"1194":{"dur":2,"text":"You really want to pay\nclose attention to it."},"1196":{"dur":1,"text":"But because of her\namygdala

damage."},"1213":{"dur":1,"text":"And overall, I think\nthat there's even"},"1214":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of a more interesting\nand important lesson there,"},"1217":{"dur":2,"text":"and that-- excuse me."},"1220":{"dur":3,"text":"And that is, we normally\nthink about emotions"},"1223":{"dur":2,"text":"and logical thinking\nor reasoning"},"1226":{"dur":2,"text":"as being kind of\nseparate in the brain."},"1228":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, if anything\nwe think about emotions"},"1230":{"dur":3,"text":"as kind of disrupting\nour ability to reason."},"1234":{"dur":3,"text":"But one of the big insights in\nthe past about 30 or so years"},"1237":{"dur":2,"text":"of neuroscience is\nthat emotions really"},"1240":{"dur":3,"text":"do play a very important\nrole in every day reasoning."},"1243":{"dur":2,"text":"They really, really\nare important."},"1246":{"dur":1,"text":"And in fact, when\nyou start to look"},"1247":{"dur":2,"text":"at cases of people like\nSarah or

behave"},"1257":{"dur":4,"text":"in really strange,\nreally irrational ways."},"1261":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, it's the\nlack of emotion"},"1263":{"dur":1,"text":"that's starting to\nmake them behave"},"1265":{"dur":1,"text":"in these really odd ways."},"1266":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's not so much that reason\nand emotion are different"},"1269":{"dur":2,"text":"or they're kind of\nopposed,

works."},"1277":{"dur":2,"text":"But again, it's a\nreally important lesson"},"1280":{"dur":2,"text":"for the past three decades\nor so of neuroscience."},"1282":{"dur":2,"text":"And emotion really is\nfundamental to a lot"},"1285":{"dur":1,"text":"of different thinking\nin the brain,"},"1286":{"dur":2,"text":"including how our\nlogical brain works."},"1288":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's thanks to\npeople like Sarah"},"1290":{"dur":2,"text":"we've gotten these insights."},"1293":{"dur":2,"text":"So again, now with\nsomething pretty basic,"},"1295":{"dur":1,"text":"pretty visceral- emotions."},"1297":{"dur":1,"text":"For the next part\nof the talk I want"},"1299":{"dur":2,"text":"to jump to something\na little higher-level"},"1302":{"dur":6,"text":"and talk a little bit
