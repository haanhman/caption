we"},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"need to be more creative\nand more effective"},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"at product design and\nproduct development?"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"So for example, how\ncan we be

of\npast history that"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"might shape how we think\nand perceive the world."},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the best ways\nto cultivate mindfulness"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"is through attention training."},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"And we train our attention\nthrough meditation."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, meditation is a broad term."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like the

a lot of activities."},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"There are a lot of\nways to meditate."},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"But the simplest and most\nwidely form of meditation"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"is to sit and focus\non the breath."},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"The breath is the\nfoundation for meditation."},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is because it's free\nand it's easily accessible."},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"It's there when you need it."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"And it calms the\nnervous system down."},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"So just to demonstrate,\nso let's try this now."},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"So come to a comfortable seat."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"And find like some\nkind of posture"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"that allows you to be relaxed\nand alert at the same time."},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"One word that I like\nto use is dignity."},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you think\nabout what it means"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"to feel dignified\nin your

choose\nto close by the eyes,"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"or you can keep them open."},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"You can have than half\nopen, half closed."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"And then bring the\nawareness within."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"Just rest the mind."},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"If you choose to\nkeep your eyes open,"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"you can gently\ngaze at something,"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"softly gaze at something, maybe\n18 inches in front of you."},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"And just pause for a moment."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"And then shift into\nfocused attention"},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"by bringing the\nawareness to the breath."},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"OK, you could also choose any\nother object of meditation."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"Sometimes people focus\non a candle or a mandala."},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"You can notice the\nrising and falling"},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"of the breath in the body."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"And in this form of\nmeditation, your awareness"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"is steady and focused."},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"So if the mind wanders,\njust notice the thoughts"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"without judgment, and then\ngently bring the awareness back"},"639":{"dur":0,"text":"to the breath."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"Take a few more breaths\nin stillness here."},"709":{"dur":5,"text":"And then slowly open the eyes,\nbring the awareness back."},"715":{"dur":0,"text":"OK."},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, I don't know\nabout you, but I"},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"find meditation to be incredibly\ndifficult, particularly"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"in this day and age when we\nhave so many things competing"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"for our attention."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"We are constantly\ndistracted, and our minds"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"are notorious at wandering\nfrom thought to thought."},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"So it is really hard\neven just to string"},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"a few moments of uninterrupted\nthought together."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"And for years I tried\nmeditation off and on,"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"hoping that it would give me\nsome refuge from the stress"},"744":{"dur":0,"text":"that I experienced."},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"And I thought that meditation\nwas about relaxing the mind"},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"and cleansing the\nmind of all thoughts."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"But I found that to\nnot be true for me."},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"Meditation is really hard work,\nand it takes a lot of practice"},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"to get there."},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"But that hard work is worth it."},"762":{"dur":4,"text":"We're are getting better insight\ninto how meditation affects"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"the brain thanks to\nadvances in FMRI technology."},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"So a study of people who\nmeditate versus people"},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"who don't found that brain\nareas linked with attention"},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"and sensory processing are\nthicker in people who meditate."},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's not just a correlation."},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"They found that the longer\nthat people meditated,"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"the thicker those parts\nof the brain can become."},"786":{"dur":4,"text":"So we can really change our\nbrains through mental training."},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"And even though focusing\nthe mind is hard work,"},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"it doesn't take\nlong to experience"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"the benefits of meditation."},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"So just meditating for 20\nminutes a day for four days"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"can result in\nsignificant improvements"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"in cognitive skills."},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's not just\ncognitive skills"},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"that improve with meditation."},"807":{"dur":4,"text":"So in 2009, Antoine\nLutz and his team"},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"tested participants before\nand after participating"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"in an intensive three-month\nmeditation retreat."},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"And they practiced mindfulness\nmeditation on a daily basis."},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"Meditators were found to\nbe significantly better"},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"at selectively training their\nattention compared to people"},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"who were just\nstarting the practice."},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"And just earlier\nthis year, there"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"was a study published from\nthe University of Miami"},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"that reported that students who\ntook a seven-week mindfulness"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"based training course showed\nsignificant improvement"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"in attention and\ndiminished mind wandering"},"846":{"dur":4,"text":"compared to a control group\nthat didn't participate in this."},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"And they had increased\nmind wandering"},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"over time and diminished\nattention and focus over time."},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"So when we create this habit of\npracticing focused attention,"},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"it becomes easier with practice."},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"Focused attention\nis like a muscle,"},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"one that gets stronger\nwith exercise."},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"Just like core, when you\npractice forearm plank, which"},"868":{"dur":4,"text":"is one of my favorite\nstrengthening exercises to do."},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"So the more you do it,\nthe easier it becomes."},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's this clarity of\nmind, this focused attention,"},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"that is paramount to the\nactive product development."},"883":{"dur":4,"text":"A cluttered mind leads to\ncluttered UI and design."},"887":{"dur":5,"text":"And an unfocused mind leads\nto a confused experience."},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"Focus refers to paying\nattention to what"},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"is most important and\nmeaningful in the moment,"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's also an\nact of letting go."},"901":{"dur":4,"text":"Simplifying and decluttering\nare also mindfulness practices."},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"And there are ways to practice\nliving in the present moment."},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"In product development,\nlack of focus"},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"often stems from a\ndeeper issue around ego."},"916":{"dur":1,"text":"So for example,\nmaybe we don't want"},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"to cut features\nbecause we don't want"},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"to disappoint early adopters\nwho want power and flexibility."},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"Or maybe we don't want to\ngive up potential revenue"},"927":{"dur":2,"text":"opportunities, even though\nit doesn't make sense"},"929":{"dur":1,"text":"for the product\nor for the users,"},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"because we don't want to\nleave money on the table."},"933":{"dur":4,"text":"Or maybe we want to add\nfunctionality to a product"},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's\ntechnically possible."},"940":{"dur":4,"text":"And in any of these cases,\nit all comes back to ego."},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"So mindfulness\npractices help people"},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"let go of their ego\nand deal with whatever"},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"is getting in the way of\nsimplifying and decluttering."},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"And then simplification\nthen becomes"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"less of an act of\nruthless elimination"},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"and more an act of\nlove and compassion"},"961":{"dur":4,"text":"for the users who ultimately\nbenefit from the product."},"965":{"dur":2,"text":"Now let's talk about empathy."},"968":{"dur":4,"text":"Empathy, like focus, is crucial\nfor great product design."},"972":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, many design leaders I\ntalk to-- including ones here"},"975":{"dur":3,"text":"at Google-- will say\nthat the number one"},"978":{"dur":3,"text":"skill that they look for when\ninterviewing potential people"},"981":{"dur":2,"text":"to join their team is empathy."},"984":{"dur":2,"text":"It's one of the top things\nthey look for when hiring."},"986":{"dur":6,"text":"And yet empathic thinking is\nincreasingly difficult for us."},"993":{"dur":3,"text":"Our constant connection\nto digital technology"},"996":{"dur":3,"text":"skews us
