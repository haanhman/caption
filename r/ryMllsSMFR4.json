private sector developers."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"So, they've got financial models\nthey're trying to look at."},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"So, there's a scale of the\nproject itself that each"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"developer has an opinion about."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"But then there's the scale of\nthe neighborhood itself and what"},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"makes sense, and are you\ntrying to maintain that scale."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"Or you could have a scale\nof a neighborhood that is"},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"predominately, let's say a\nquarter of big box retail."},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"Neighborhoods are behind that."},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"You got two different scales\nright up next to each other."},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you can begin to\ntransition between large scale,"},"708":{"dur":4,"text":"small scale by inserting some\nnew development that transitions"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"and builds a more complete\nneighborhood in terms of uses,"},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"which then makes it more\nwalkable in terms of you don't"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"have to get in your car\nand drive three miles."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"So, these

happens."},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"Crosstown is a good\nexample of huge buildings."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"One large building in the\ncity sits predominately in a"},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"residential surrounded \nby mostly residential"},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"and small scale commercial."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"You'd say hypothetically\nsomeone might say,"},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"well, that's out of scale."},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, it is if you\njust measure scale."},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"But if you measure the uses\nand how it blends and how it"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"connects, that

you"},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"understand its intentional\nby how its put together."},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"So, it's.."},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"- Ashley, to get\nthose, you

Right."},"1301":{"dur":3,"text":"Our goal is A -- not to slow\ndown any work that's happening"},"1304":{"dur":3,"text":"or any projects that are\nhappening but really look at

counties"},"1382":{"dur":5,"text":"to come up with a common vision\nfor connectivity long term."},"1388":{"dur":5,"text":"So, we focused a lot on green\nspace but also on sort of the"},"1393":{"dur":4,"text":"effects of green space and\ninvesting in green space,"},"1398":{"dur":4,"text":"which, you know, I think so many\npeople can attest to today with"},"1403":{"dur":2,"text":"so much success that\nwe've had with green spaces."},"1405":{"dur":4,"text":"It is truly transformational\nfor the community"},"1410":{"dur":1,"text":"and for the region."},"1411":{"dur":1,"text":"- And so much of that stuff\nwas happening organically."},"1412":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, there was a Greenline."},"1414":{"dur":1,"text":"And then there was the\nVollintine-Evergreen Greenline."},"1415":{"dur":1,"text":"And then the Wolf River\nConservancy starts talking about"},"1417":{"dur":1,"text":"doing what it's doing."},"1418":{"dur":2,"text":"And

Whitehaven."},"1424":{"dur":1,"text":"But there's not\nthat holistic vision, right?"},"1426":{"dur":1,"text":"Is that a fair analogy?"},"1427":{"dur":1,"text":"- Absolutely."},"1428":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I think in terms of\nhow the Greenprint plays in,"},"1430":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, in one sense, it\nprovides a model for us in"},"1433":{"dur":3,"text":"figuring out, you know, what's\nthe best way to kind of pull all"},"1436":{"dur":2,"text":"of this alignment together and\nmake sure that we're honoring"},"1439":{"dur":4,"text":"those sort of projects and\nplans that are in place."},"1443":{"dur":3,"text":"But it also provides, I\nthink, a good foundation for us."},"1447":{"dur":3,"text":"We just went through a \npretty robust planning process"},"1450":{"dur":1,"text":"across the region."},"1451":{"dur":3,"text":"We talked about, you\nknow, specifically how,"},"1454":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, communities connect to\nthat network and in this case,"},"1459":{"dur":3,"text":"how the city of Memphis sort\nof anchors into that network."},"1462":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, we've got a lot

areas"},"1473":{"dur":2,"text":"that we know we'll\naddress in Memphis 3.0."},"1476":{"dur":1,"text":"- We just have a minute left."},"1477":{"dur":2,"text":"I've heard you speak before\nabout Memphis

chance"},"1496":{"dur":1,"text":"of getting that money."},"1497":{"dur":1,"text":"- I think you're\nabsolutely right."},"1499":{"dur":6,"text":"I mean, I think there were\nso many factors of why Shelby"},"1506":{"dur":2,"text":"County was awarded\nthat $60 million."},"1508":{"dur":1,"text":"Chief among \nthose factors was"},"1510":{"dur":3,"text":"because we had\nthe Greenprint
