That is the last thing we need!\""},"913":{"dur":6,"text":"The days went by, and things continued on as they were.

His mind would wonder,"},"936":{"dur":8,"text":"but his thoughts changed too fast to be remembered. He would pace around his small room like a caged animal, or stare out the window."},"945":{"dur":10,"text":"The unhealthy cycle continued. Connie continued to be pushed around by her husband, being way too submissive to him, and Toby remained in his room."},"957":{"dur":5,"text":"Before he could think twice, he would begin to chew on his hands, tearing the flesh from his fingers."},"964":{"dur":7,"text":"He would gnaw his hands until they bled.

His memory grew glitchy as well."},"991":{"dur":12,"text":"He'd start missing memory of minutes, hours, days, and so on. He would begin talking nonsense, about things completely unrelated to conversations he would have."},"1004":{"dur":12,"text":"He'd go off about seeing things, sharks in his sink as he washed the dishes, hearing crickets in his pillows, and seeing ghosts outside his bedroom window."},"1016":{"dur":6,"text":"All the nonsense landed him in a counselor's office. His mother grew too anxious about his mental health,"},"1023":{"dur":4,"text":"she decided it would be good for him to talk to a professional about what he was feeling."},"1029":{"dur":10,"text":"Connie walked Toby into the building, holding his hand and guiding him in. She walked him up to the front desk and began talking to the lady who sat behind it."},"1040":{"dur":9,"text":"\"Mrs. Rogers?\" The lady asked. \"Yes that's me,\" Connie nodded, \"We're here to see doctor Oliver, I'm here with Toby Rogers\""},"1050":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Yes, right this way,\" The lady stood up and lead them down a long hallway."},"1055":{"dur":7,"text":"Toby looked at the framed artwork down the halls and tuned in to the sound of the lady's high heels on the hardwood floor."},"1063":{"dur":10,"text":"She opened the door to a room with a table and two chairs. \"If we can get him to sit in here for a few minutes, I'll get the doctor,\" She smiled and held the door open."},"1074":{"dur":8,"text":"Toby stumbled into the room and sat down at the table.

He stared, eyes widened, the ringing growing louder and louder until suddenly the loud voice of the counselor broke his trance."},"1238":{"dur":7,"text":"\"Toby!\" She yelled. Toby jumped and fell sideways out of his chair and back up into the corner."},"1247":{"dur":11,"text":"Doctor Oliver stood up, holding her clipboard to her chest. A surprised look in her eyes. Toby met her eyes again, his breath hitching as he twitched."},"1260":{"dur":12,"text":"That night Toby laid in bed. His eyes dazed as he stared straight up at his ceiling. He could feel himself begin to doze off, when he heard the scattering of footsteps down his hallway."},"1273":{"dur":3,"text":"He sat up and looked towards the doorway, his door wide open."},"1277":{"dur":8,"text":"There was no light, everything was lit by the luminescent blue glow of the moon through his window, leaving a cold lighting."},"1287":{"dur":8,"text":"He stood up and slowly made his way towards the doorway, when suddenly the door, which was previously wide open, slammed in his face."},"1297":{"dur":7,"text":"He gasped and fell back. His was out of breathe when he hit the ground and he began breathing heavily, his eyes wide open."},"1305":{"dur":9,"text":"He waited for a few seconds before getting back up on his feet. He reached out and grasped the cold door handle with his bandaged hand and creaked it open."},"1315":{"dur":11,"text":"He looked out into the dark hallway and tiptoed out of his room. The window at the end of the hallway lit up the darkness with blue moonlight as he padded his way down."},"1328":{"dur":11,"text":"He could hear footsteps rustling around him, and faint giggling let by the pitter patter of small feet, which sounded like a child had run in front of him,"},"1339":{"dur":11,"text":"giggling and running around. The hallway was a lot longer than he had remembered. It seemed endless... like the ride home from the hospital."},"1351":{"dur":7,"text":"He heard a door creak in front of him. \"Mom?\" he called out in a shaky voice."},"1358":{"dur":5,"text":"Suddenly a door slammed behind him and he jumped and turned around."},"1365":{"dur":6,"text":"Behind him he heard a long eerie groan from behind him, that sounded to croak right in his ear."},"1371":{"dur":6,"text":"He turned around as fast as he could and was suddenly face to face with none other than his dead sister."},"1378":{"dur":11,"text":"Her eyes were clouded white, her skin pale, and the right side of her jaw only dangling on by tissue and muscle, glass protruding from her forehead,"},"1389":{"dur":14,"text":"and black blood leaking down her face, her blonde hair pulled up back in a ponytail as it always was, wearing her grey t-shirt and athletic shorts which were dirty and spotted with blood."},"1404":{"dur":12,"text":"Her legs were bent in ways they shouldn't be. She stood, emitting a long croaking noise, only an inch away from Toby's face. Toby yelped and fell back."},"1417":{"dur":8,"text":"\"AW!\" he started to crawl backwards away from her, not able to break the eye contact he held with her, blank, dead eyes."},"1426":{"dur":5,"text":"He dragged himself backwards until he backed up into something.He stopped for a second."},"1433":{"dur":11,"text":"Everything was dead silent except for his heavy breathing and crying. He slowly looked up to meet the blank face of a tall dark figure that stood over him."},"1446":{"dur":13,"text":"Behind the tall dark mass where rows of children, looking to range from 3 to 10 years, their eyes completely black and dark black blood leaked from their eye sockets."},"1460":{"dur":7,"text":"He screamed and stood up as fast as he could only to be tripped by dark black tendrils that wrapped around his ankle."},"1468":{"dur":4,"text":"He fell straight on his stomach and got the wind knocked out of his chest."},"1473":{"dur":7,"text":"He tried to scream out but he couldn't make a sound. He wheezed out, before it all went black."},"1482":{"dur":6,"text":"Toby woke up with a start. He screamed out and sat up as fast as he could, completely short of breathe."},"1489":{"dur":8,"text":"He wheezed out and held his chest with his bandaged hands. It was just a dream.... just a dream."},"1499":{"dur":8,"text":"He laid back down on his bed and rolled over on his side. It felt like a giant weight had been lifted off his chest as he took in deep breathes."},"1509":{"dur":14,"text":"He stood up and padded over to his window. He saw nothing. Nobody was out there. No ghosts. No figures. Nothing. He heard the rustling and coughing of his father out the doorway."},"1524":{"dur":6,"text":"His door was closed. He walked over and opened it. Looking out into the hallway once again."},"1532":{"dur":5,"text":"He padded down the hallway and into the kitchen where he found his dad standing and having a smoke in their living room."},"1538":{"dur":6,"text":"Toby waited a second and watched him from around the corner before a burning feeling started deep in his chest."},"1546":{"dur":12,"text":"Deep, boiling, anger took over him. He heard the little imaginary voices in his head. \"Do it, Do it, Do it,\" they chanted."},"1559":{"dur":10,"text":"He turned away and held his arms. He felt like he actually had control over himself, unlike he did for the past few weeks since he got home from the hospital."},"1569":{"dur":7,"text":"He actually had complete thoughts for just moments before they were clouded by the chanting of the little voices in his head."},"1578":{"dur":18,"text":"\"Kill him, he wasn't there, he wasn't there, kill him, kill him,\" they continued on. Toby trembled. No. No he wasn't going to do it. What, was he going crazy? No."},"1598":{"dur":7,"text":"He won't kill anyone. He can't. He hated his father, but hated no way he was going to kill him. That was it."},"1606":{"dur":8,"text":"The last thought he had before he fell into an idle state once again. The influence of the voices in his head was too much."},"1615":{"dur":10,"text":"He began to silently walk up behind his father. He reached over the counter to the knife holder in the kitchen and pulled out a the largest knife that had been resting in the case."},"1627":{"dur":7,"text":"He gripped it in his hand. He felt a sensation take over his chest. He let out a snicker."},"1636":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Heh... hehe... hehehehehe!

Get off of me you little fucker!\" he yelled and with his other hand he threw an off center punch towards Toby's shoulder, but he didn't stop."},"1681":{"dur":6,"text":"The look in Toby's eyes was not sane.
