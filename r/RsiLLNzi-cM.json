{"0":{"dur":7,"text":"Translator: Gustavo Rocha\nReviewer: Capa Girl"},"14":{"dur":2,"text":"Good afternoon, my name is Michelle Rhee,"},"17":{"dur":3,"text":"I am the former chancellor of the Washington DC schools"},"20":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm also currently the CEO of an organization called Students First."},"25":{"dur":3,"text":"And the whole idea behind Students First is a simple one,"},"28":{"dur":1,"text":"and it is that:"},"30":{"dur":4,"text":"if you look over the last twenty to thirty years in this country,"},"34":{"dur":3,"text":"at the decisions that we have been making about education,"},"37":{"dur":2,"text":"they have largely been driven by special interest groups."},"40":{"dur":1,"text":"So you have textbook manufacturers,"},"42":{"dur":1,"text":"you have teacher's unions,"},"43":{"dur":1,"text":"you have testing companies."},"45":{"dur":4,"text":"You've all these organizations that have tremendous resources"},"50":{"dur":4,"text":"and therefore tremendous influence on how decisions get made."},"54":{"dur":1,"text":"So, that's the way the world works."},"56":{"dur":4,"text":"The fact those organizations exist is not actually the problem."},"60":{"dur":5,"text":"The problem that we face is that there is no organized national interest group"},"66":{"dur":2,"text":"with the same heft that, say, the teacher's union"},"68":{"dur":4,"text":"that's advocating on behalf of children in education."},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"So, when children are left out of the equation"},"74":{"dur":2,"text":"and no one is defending what is good and right for them"},"77":{"dur":1,"text":"and you have all these other special interests"},"79":{"dur":5,"text":"what you end up with is a landscape that is very skewed towards the adults"},"84":{"dur":2,"text":"and very skewed away from children."},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that's exactly what Students First aims to try to do,"},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"is balance that equation out"},"92":{"dur":3,"text":"and make sure that we have millions of members across the country"},"95":{"dur":3,"text":"that are advocating for what children deserve."},"99":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I am often asked,"},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"because I was both the superintendent of a school district"},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"and now I run this organization, people always say,"},"106":{"dur":3,"text":"\"What's wrong with education in America today?\""},"109":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Why are we doing so poorly?\""},"112":{"dur":1,"text":"And often times people say, you know,"},"114":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Give us what the biggest issue in education is.\""},"117":{"dur":2,"text":"And I always refuse to answer that question."},"120":{"dur":4,"text":"I refuse to answer it because actually what is wrong with our system is pretty complicated"},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"and when you try to distill it down to just one thing"},"128":{"dur":3,"text":"then it sort of implies that if you solve that one thing"},"131":{"dur":1,"text":"you're gonna fix all of the problems,"},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"when in fact that is actually not true."},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"But people don't like taking no for an answer,"},"138":{"dur":3,"text":"and so usually -- It is the press, the media, they're very persistent"},"141":{"dur":3,"text":"and they go to me on, it's like, \"Come on, tell us what it is!"},"145":{"dur":1,"text":"It's the teacher's union, isn't it?"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"Or the parents, or we don't have enough money?"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"Come on, tell us what it is.\""},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"And you've actually probably heard a lot of this too,"},"155":{"dur":2,"text":"you go to your cocktail parties"},"157":{"dur":4,"text":"you and your friends sort of bemoaned the state of public education in our country,"},"162":{"dur":1,"text":"and then inevitably it sort of devolves down into"},"164":{"dur":5,"text":"what we need to do is invest more in our schools."},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"The question is: is that really right?"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I'm gonna show you some data,"},"174":{"dur":5,"text":"the first slide, when Americans are asked how much money"},"179":{"dur":4,"text":"they think we are spending on public education in America today."},"184":{"dur":1,"text":"What do they say?"},"186":{"dur":5,"text":"They think that we spend about four thousand dollar a year per kid."},"191":{"dur":4,"text":"The reality is that we spend several times that,"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"actually about ten thousand dollar a year."},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's a huge disconnect"},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"and that is not the only disconnect"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"because when those same people are asked"},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"they will very confidently tell you"},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"that they believe if we spent more money on education"},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"we would get better results."},"214":{"dur":1,"text":"So take a look at this:"},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"the red line shows the expenditure growth on education"},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"over the last few decades in this country"},"223":{"dur":4,"text":"and the blue line shows our academic achievement levels,"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"of our children in both reading and math"},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"and as you can see"},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"we have grown several times what we are spending"},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"and yet our children's academic progress"},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"has remained pretty stagnant."},"239":{"dur":4,"text":"This creates an incredibly difficult dynamic"},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"in these top economic times"},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"where people are still trying to figure out what to cut in the budgets, etc."},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"Because if, for example, in the last few decades"},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"we had tripled the expenditures"},"257":{"dur":3,"text":"and the achievement levels had also tripled,"},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"then you would be able to say, \"Ok, if you cut our budget by ten percent"},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"this is the loss that you are gonna see.\""},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"But we actually can't show that at all,"},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"in fact, in the last couple of years"},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"there've been several states that have cut their education budgets"},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"and seen their academic achievement levels rise"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"so we're in this really tough quandary right now"},"279":{"dur":4,"text":"about -- you know, what the relationship is"},"284":{"dur":3,"text":"between expenditures and progress."},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"So why is there this disconnect?"},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"Where is all of this money going?"},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"If we have grown the amount of money that we are spending so much"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"and we haven't seen the results, what's happening?"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm gonna tell you a very quick story from when I was the chancellor in Washington DC."},"302":{"dur":4,"text":"In 2007 I took over the Washington DC public schools,"},"307":{"dur":5,"text":"at the time they were largely known as the most dysfunctional"},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"and lowest performing school district in the entire nation."},"316":{"dur":5,"text":"Just to give a sliver of data to elucidate that for you:"},"322":{"dur":5,"text":"of all of the 8th graders who were attending school in DC"},"327":{"dur":5,"text":"in 2007 only 8% of them were on grade level in mathematics"},"333":{"dur":4,"text":"8 % -- which means that 92% of our kids"},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"did not have the skills and knowledge necessary"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"to be productive members of society."},"343":{"dur":5,"text":"So, it was no surprise that the young upstart mayor"},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"who had just been elected, his name was Adrian Fenty,"},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"decided that as his major priority"},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"he was gonna take on fixing the schools."},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"Because his theory was: you cannot have a great city"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"without a great public school system."},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"So, he decided to introduce legislation"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"that would allow him to take over"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"mayoral control of the schools."},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"And he got the legislation past"},"372":{"dur":5,"text":"and in June of 2007, as his first act of having control of the schools,"},"377":{"dur":4,"text":"he nominated me as the city's first school's chancellor."},"382":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, I was a 37 year old Korean girl from Toledo, Ohio,"},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"who had never run a school much less a school district."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"So people were looking at him and saying,"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"\"This guy's crazy."},"395":{"dur":4,"text":"Why would he think that she is a person"},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"who can fix the most dysfunctional school district in the country?\""},"403":{"dur":6,"text":"And so for days the thought that was teeming through everybody's mind was,"},"409":{"dur":4,"text":"What on God's green Earth is Adrian Fenty thinking?"},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was pretty much what I was thinking"},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"as I was sitting in my office"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"the first few days of my tenure,"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"thinking, where do you start when you have to fix"},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"something where every single thing is broken essentially?"},"427":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I was lucky enough to have lots of people who wanted to come in and help"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"and a number of these people had actually seen"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"what had been going on in the school district for several decades"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"and they had lot of thoughts about what needed to change."},"440":{"dur":4,"text":"Over and over again in my conversations with them"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"what they said to me was, \"You have to find out, Michelle,"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"where all of the money is going.\""},"450":{"dur":4,"text":"Because we were spending almost more money in Washington DC,"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"per child, than any other urban jurisdiction in the country"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"yet our results were absolutely abysmal."},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"So, when you went into the schools"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"you saw dilapidated school buildings,"},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"you saw teachers who had to buy supplies with their own money,"},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"it did not feel like one of the richest school districts in the nation."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"So it made sense to us that we would try to figure out where the money was being spent."},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I sent my team out,"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"I said, you know, go look at every spreadsheet,"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"every excel document you can,"},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"tell me where we're spending the money."},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"So, a couple of weeks later my special assistant comes back to me"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"and he says: \"Ok, I did exactly what you said,"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"I looked at all of the largest budget items"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"and tried to figure out where they are going.\""},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"He said, \"I have found two very interesting things.\""},"497":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, in education speak, interesting is code for whack --(Laughter)"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the first thing that he says is,"},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Number one: we are spending about ninety million dollars a year"},"510":{"dur":5,"text":"transporting a few thousand special education kids through the system.\""},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I do the quick back of the envelope math,"},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"'cause that sounds a little nuts"},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"and it turns out that it's about 18,000 dollars"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"per year per kid on transportation."},"526":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I said, I don't know anything about running bus routes,"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"but I'm pretty sure I can do it for less than 18,000 dollars a year."},"533":{"dur":5,"text":"For 18,000 dollars a year you could buy the kid a Saturn the first year,"},"539":{"dur":4,"text":"and a personal chauffeur for the Saturn every year after that."},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I am confident that we can do it more effectively."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"and the good news is that we're gonna be able to take the savings"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"and push it down into the classroom"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"where it's gonna have more of an impact on kids."},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"And he said, \"Actually, not so fast.\""},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"See, the problem is that the district had done such a poor job"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"of transporting the special needs kids to their schools in the past"},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"that now we're under a court order, a consent decree"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's this court appointed special master,"},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"and he has the responsibility for transporting the kids to school every day,"},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"he's allowed to spend as much money as he wants,"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"and all we can do at the end of the year is pay the bill."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"We have absolutely no ability to control cost."},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"And I said, that is the craziest thing I have ever heard!"},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"And he said that's because you haven't heard titbit number two -- (Laughter)"},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"He said i'm trying to figure out where are all these children going."},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"Washington DC is only a few square miles wide and long,"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"you could be doing laps around the city all day"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"and you still shouldn't be able to burn off 18,000 dollars worth of fuel,"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"so where is all the money going?"},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"It turns out that we were not just doing a bad job"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"of transporting these special education kids,"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"we were doing a very bad job of educating them as well."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"And this sort of culture became"},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"that parents would sue the school district"},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"because their kids weren't getting the services and resources that they needed."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"We would inevitably lose that lawsuit,"},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"because we were, in fact, doing a pretty sucky job"},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"and then, the court would prescribe a remedy"},"638":{"dur":4,"text":"and most often that remedy was that they would send them to a private school"},"642":{"dur":4,"text":"and we would be required to pay the tuition to that private school."},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was not just that, but every kid had a different remedy."},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you had a situation where you might have a housing complex,"},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"that had ten special needs kids living in it,"},"656":{"dur":4,"text":"and each of these ten kids would all be assigned to a different school"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"in these far-flung places, in Virginia and in Maryland."},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"So you'd have ten different buses roll up in the morning"},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"with ten different bus drivers"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"and ten different bus matrons who were making sure that the kids are ok on the bus,"},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"all going in different directions to these far-flung places."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"That was one of the reasons"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"that we were spending all of this money and not seeing any results."},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, this is actually not just unique to Washington DC."},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"If you look at this next slide you will see"},"690":{"dur":5,"text":"that since the 1970s we have had more than 26 states"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"have court mandated, sort of education finance cases,"},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"that have resulted in really, really dramatic increases to funding,"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"education funding."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"And the whole goal of that was to try"},"708":{"dur":5,"text":"to equalize things and make the education achievement levels"},"713":{"dur":5,"text":"of minority kids more... equal to where it was for other children."},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"Have we succeed to that?"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"No is the quick answer."},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"If you look at the minority achievement level in these 26 states,"},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"it really hasn't gone anywhere,"},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"in fact, a review of three states in particular"},"730":{"dur":4,"text":"shows that the achievement levels of the minority kids in these three states"},"735":{"dur":5,"text":"where they had these increases actually didn't even keep up with the national averages."},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"This is not just about the courts,"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"it is about lots of different special interest groups."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"You have the state governments, you have the federal government,"},"748":{"dur":5,"text":"you have school board, everybody wants to put in set-asides."},"754":{"dur":4,"text":"So, they say, we want some of this money to go to curriculum development,"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"we want some of the money to go to this community program,"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"we want some of the money to go to textbook adoptions,"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"and they mandate these set-asides and what it results in"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"is that of the 10,000 dollars that we are spending per child,"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"actually only about half of it is going into the classroom"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"where we think it's gonna have the most impact,"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"the rest of it is going to these other things."},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"So, this slide actually jives more with people's perceptions"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"of how much money is being spent,"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"because that's what they see in the classroom."},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"So, let's get to what needs to happen about it."},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"It's actually pretty simple."},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"We need to stop spending money on things that do not work"},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"and start putting our money towards the things that do."},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"More specifically what that means in a school district"},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"is that we should set really specific goals"},"807":{"dur":4,"text":"for what we expect a classroom or a school to achieve,"},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"we have to give people the freedom"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"and the autonomy to make the decisions"},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"about where those dollars are gonna be best spent to get to that goal."},"820":{"dur":4,"text":"Then we have to measure whether or not they met the goal or not,"},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"and then we have to have some accountabilty,"},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"so, if you did meet the goal or exceeded the goal"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"then we're gonna look at what you did"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"and we're gonna share those best practices with others."},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you did not meet the goal"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"then we're not gonna let you spend the money in the same way."},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"But that is not the way that we run things."},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"So, in order to change the system"},"842":{"dur":4,"text":"it's not just gonna require a change with the courts and the federal government."},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"It actually also requires a cultural change."},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"And let me tell you why. As a parent, and I have two kids,"},"854":{"dur":4,"text":"I had this perception of what school should look like for my two daughters."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"So when my daughter went to kindergarten,"},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"I thought, I want a grandmotherly woman"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"who has had a long teaching career,"},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"who will take my daughter on her lap, and read her a book"},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"and if she's only in the classroom with 15 or 16 other kids,"},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"that's gonna be better for my child."},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"What I don't want is for her to be sitting in front of"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, computers, in front of a computer screen"},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"because that seems cold and rigid and that sort of thing, right?"},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is what we believe"},"886":{"dur":3,"text":"we hold as our -- sort of beliefs."},"889":{"dur":4,"text":"But the reality actually is that the research shows"},"894":{"dur":2,"text":"that class size largely doesn't matter."},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"If you have a smaller class size versus a larger class size,"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"it doesn't have that much impact on a student's achievement levels,"},"901":{"dur":4,"text":"and the latest data that's coming out from some of these new programs"},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"that utilize technology pretty heavy in the classroom"},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"shows very good results for kids"},"911":{"dur":4,"text":"because you can differentiate for the individual needs of every child."},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"So, at the end of the day what we have to do"},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"is ensure that we are not continuing"},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"to spend more money and not fix the system"},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"and expect that we're gonna get a different result."},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"What we need to do is something very very different"},"933":{"dur":2,"text":"we have to reinvigorate the system"},"935":{"dur":3,"text":"by investing in what works and by innovating."},"939":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the bottom line is that the next time you go to a cocktail party"},"943":{"dur":3,"text":"where you hear your friend Ted say"},"946":{"dur":4,"text":"that we've gotta spend more money on education to fix it."},"951":{"dur":3,"text":"You should say, \"Do we, Ted? Do we?\""},"955":{"dur":2,"text":"Because really what we ought to be doing is"},"958":{"dur":3,"text":"ensuring that we are"},"962":{"dur":3,"text":"not over mandating and over prescribing"},"965":{"dur":2,"text":"where the dollar should be spent."},"968":{"dur":5,"text":"That we're innovating around new strategies that can help kids learn"},"973":{"dur":3,"text":"and that at the end of the day, we should funnel our resources"},"976":{"dur":3,"text":"to where we know it's working for kids."},"979":{"dur":3,"text":"That is surely gonna make you the head of the party."},"983":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."}}
