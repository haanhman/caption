linear algebra."},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"And different books\nemphasize different aspects"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"and use different languages."},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"And they also try to aim\nat

I'll be providing\nwith your problem sets readings"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"from each of the\nrecommended texts."},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"So what I really encourage you\nto do is find a group of people"},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"to work with every\nweek, and make sure"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"that you've got all the\nbooks covered between you."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"This'll give you as\nmuch

I guess\nthe last thing to say"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"is if this stuff\nwere totally trivial,"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"you wouldn't need to be here."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"So ask questions."},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're confused\nabout something,"},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"lots of other\npeople in the class"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"are also going to be

questions."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"Don't hesitate to interrupt."},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"Just raise your hand, and I\nwill do my best to call on you."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is true\nfor

question."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"Someone else will\nalso be confused."},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a very valuable\nto me and everyone else."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"So before I get going\non the actual physics"},"456":{"dur":5,"text":"content of the class, are there\nany other practical questions?"},"462":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: You said there\nwas a

be\nwalking to school"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"and your leg is\ngoing to fall off,"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"or a dog's going to jump out\nand eat your person standing"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"next to you, whatever."},"481":{"dur":0,"text":"Things happen."},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"So we will drop your\nlowest problem set score"},"484":{"dur":0,"text":"without any

technical\nnames for these properties"},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"later on in the semester."},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"But to avoid distracting you\nby preconceived notions of what"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"these things mean, I'm going\nto use ambiguous labels, color"},"676":{"dur":0,"text":"and hardness."},"677":{"dur":10,"text":"And the empirical fact is that\nevery electron, every electron"},"687":{"dur":7,"text":"that's ever been observed\nis either black or white"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"and no other color."},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"We've never seen\na blue

properties."},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"OK?"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, what I mean\nby this is that it"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"is possible to\nbuild a device which"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"measures the color\nand the hardness."},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"In particular, it\nis possible to build"},"731":{"dur":5,"text":"a box, which I will call a color\nbox, that measures the color."},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"And the way it works is this."},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"It has three apertures,\nan in port and two out"},"741":{"dur":4,"text":"ports, one which sends\nout black electrons"},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"and one which sends\nout white electrons."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"And the utility of this\nbox is that the color"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"can be inferred\nfrom the position."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"If you find the particle,\nthe electron over here,"},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"it is a white electron."},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"If you find the electron\nhere, it is a black electron."},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"Cool?"},"766":{"dur":4,"text":"Similarly, we can\nbuild a hardness box,"},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"which again has three\napertures, an in port."},"772":{"dur":6,"text":"And hard electrons\ncome out this port,"},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"and soft electrons\ncome out this port."},"790":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, if you want, you're free\nto imagine that these boxes are"},"794":{"dur":5,"text":"built by putting\na monkey inside."},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"And you send in an\nelectron, and the monkey,"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"you know, with the ears,\nlooks at the electron,"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"and says it's a hard electron,\nit sends it out one way,"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"or it's a soft electron,\nit sends it out the

detail"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"the workings inside\nthis apparatus."},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"And here's something I\nwant to emphasize to you."},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"It can be built in\nprinciple using monkeys,"},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"hyper intelligent monkeys\nthat can see electrons."},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"It could also be built using\nmagnets and silver atoms."},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"It

inside."},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"But if you want a\nlittle idea, you"},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"could imagine putting a monkey\ninside, a hyper intelligent"},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"monkey."},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"I know, it sounds good."},"856":{"dur":5,"text":"So a key property of these\nhardness boxes and color boxes"},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"is that they are repeatable."},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"And here's what I mean by that."},"865":{"dur":3,"text":"If I send in an electron,\nand I find that it comes out"},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"of a color box black, and\nthen I send it in again,"},"872":{"dur":1,"text":"then if I send it into\nanother color box,"},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"it comes out black

box"},"904":{"dur":1,"text":"will come out the\nwhite aperture again."},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"And 0% of the time will it\ncome out the black aperture."},"909":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is

they be correlated?"},"978":{"dur":3,"text":"Might knowing the color infer\nsomething about the hardness?"},"981":{"dur":5,"text":"So for example, so being\nmale and being a
