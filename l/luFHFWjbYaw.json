movement continues,"},"51":{"dur":2,"text":"more facets of it also continue to emerge."},"54":{"dur":2,"text":"One of those facets is green business."},"57":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, what does that mean, and how can it help\nthe environment?"},"60":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, here to answer that question is Ryan\nWolber, certification manager for the Illinois"},"65":{"dur":1,"text":"Green Business Association."},"66":{"dur":3,"text":"And you are here as part of the program through\nthe Charleston Chamber of Commerce."},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we thank you for stopping by the studio\nto talk about green business."},"73":{"dur":1,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nThank you for having me."},"75":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nWell, Ryan, tell us a little bit about what"},"76":{"dur":1,"text":"your organization does."},"78":{"dur":2,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nWell, so the Illinois Green Business Association"},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"is a 501 C-3 non-profit."},"83":{"dur":5,"text":"We focus on engaging businesses, on large\nand small levels across the state, to really"},"88":{"dur":2,"text":"incorporate sustainability into their business\npractices."},"90":{"dur":2,"text":"We do this through three main programs."},"92":{"dur":5,"text":"We have our green business certification program,\nwhich covers nine areas of business sustainability,"},"98":{"dur":5,"text":"from pollution prevention, to energy conservation,\nwater conservation, to even engaging the community."},"103":{"dur":4,"text":"Our second program is our public engagement\naspect, along with education."},"107":{"dur":4,"text":"That includes green drinks on a monthly basis\nto engage community leaders and businesses"},"112":{"dur":1,"text":"to our upcoming annual green business summit."},"114":{"dur":5,"text":"That summit, our annual summit is really an\nend of the year celebration, get-together"},"120":{"dur":4,"text":"event to talk about what were the successes,\nwhat can we do to improve, and where is this"},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"industry trending."},"125":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, this year will be in Tinley Park,\nOctober 15th."},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"It will be a great event."},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"And that kind of wraps up our educational\naspect."},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"Our third program is our direct installation\nprogram."},"135":{"dur":6,"text":"We partner with various utility companies,\nAmeren Illinois, Nicor up in the Chicagoland,"},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"suburb area, to install energy efficient equipment."},"144":{"dur":6,"text":"We'll go into businesses, small, large, mostly\non a smaller scale, and do energy installations."},"150":{"dur":5,"text":"That can be lighting upgrades, faucet aerators\nthat actually infuse a little bit of air jets"},"155":{"dur":4,"text":"into the water, streaming to make it a little\nmore efficient, water efficient."},"160":{"dur":4,"text":"Both of those installations then have direct\nfinancial savings for a business."},"164":{"dur":3,"text":"So, those are the three main programs that\nwe as an organization reach through."},"168":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"So, now tell us where your offices are located\nat."},"172":{"dur":1,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nYeah."},"173":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the IGB, we were founded eight years ago,\nfive years ago in 2008."},"177":{"dur":5,"text":"Three college students at the U of I got together,\nthey were doing off-campus recycling with"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"residents and businesses."},"184":{"dur":5,"text":"And then, someone asked a question: why is\nGreen Street, the main street on campus, not"},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"green?"},"190":{"dur":1,"text":"There was trash everywhere, litter."},"191":{"dur":6,"text":"And so, they started researching various business\nprograms, ways to engage communities and businesses,"},"198":{"dur":1,"text":"to make them more environmentally friendly."},"199":{"dur":4,"text":"And they found the California Green Business\nprogram, based out in the San Francisco Bay"},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"area."},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"And they've been in existence for about ten\nyears now, ten, fifteen years."},"207":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, went out to California, worked with\nthem, collaborated, to then bring back a green"},"212":{"dur":1,"text":"certification program."},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's where we're based out of: Urbana\/Champaign."},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"And we still have our main offices there,\nbut then we have partnerships across the state"},"220":{"dur":1,"text":"in seven different communities now."},"221":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you cover and travel to all the different\nparts of the state."},"225":{"dur":1,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nYes."},"226":{"dur":5,"text":"Yes, we're kind of all along the I-74 corridor,\nUrbana\/Champaign, Bloomington\/Normal, Peoria,"},"231":{"dur":6,"text":"Galesburg, Charleston, and the Eastern Illinois\nUniversity region, along with Oak Park River"},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"Forest, LaGrange, and Tinley Park region."},"239":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nSo, the whole idea started with some college"},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"students, U of I students."},"242":{"dur":1,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nYes."},"243":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nNow, are they still involved in the project?"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nYes, they're the three original founders."},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"We're a four-person staff, so I'm the new\naddition."},"250":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, we have a very dedicated Board of\nDirectors, business leaders, community leaders,"},"255":{"dur":4,"text":"that meet on a daily basis and really focus\non a strategic vision; where do we see the"},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"organization going, and how can we get there?"},"260":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's talk a little bit about how the term\n'green' has evolved."},"265":{"dur":4,"text":"When did it sort of start to become a little\nmore mainstream, and how has that term changed"},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"over the years?"},"270":{"dur":1,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nWell, I'd say the 'green' term started back"},"272":{"dur":5,"text":"in the 70s, 80s; really, it was attributed\nto more of the hippie era movement, as you"},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"could say."},"279":{"dur":5,"text":"But it really caught on in, I would definitely\nsay early 2000s, \"Inconvenient Truth,\" Al"},"284":{"dur":4,"text":"Gore really led the charge and brought green\nback to the mainstream."},"289":{"dur":4,"text":"But in the last five years with the recession\nand economic downturn, businesses were looking"},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"for a way to cut costs."},"294":{"dur":5,"text":"How can we improve our bottom line: increase\nprofits, increase revenue."},"299":{"dur":5,"text":"And they found that being more resourceful,\nmore conservative with their resources, with"},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"energy usage and water usage, was a great\nplace to start."},"308":{"dur":4,"text":"So, that is, I would say, the newest addition\nof the green movement, is the more business"},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"angle and being more efficient with your resources."},"315":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nWell..."},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, sorry."},"317":{"dur":3,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nNo, I was going to add that while that's the"},"320":{"dur":4,"text":"general nationwide aspect, then it's broken\ndown into various areas."},"325":{"dur":5,"text":"Western part of the United States, California,\nactually has very vigorous pollution programs"},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"and regulations."},"331":{"dur":4,"text":"So, that's more motivated by a regulatory\npush."},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"Southern United States has a stronger water\nfocus."},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"So, through drought, and those reasons."},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"Illinois is really focused on the energy savings,\nthe water savings, and the business aspect"},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"of it."},"347":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nOkay, so let's talk about some simple things"},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"that businesses can do to become more green."},"352":{"dur":1,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nYeah."},"353":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nWhat are some practices?"},"354":{"dur":1,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nI would definitely encourage all businesses"},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"to get an energy efficient audit through their\nutility provider."},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"If you look at your utility bill, there will\nbe a little portion where it says you're paying"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"a small fee to a proficiency program."},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"So, businesses and people are already paying\na small part of their utility bill for these"},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"efficiency programs."},"370":{"dur":5,"text":"And that money is then used as incentives\nfor businesses to get these fantastic upgrades."},"375":{"dur":4,"text":"They can see a payback on energy efficient\nlighting, upgrade probably in three to five"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"months."},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"And in the business world, a three to five\nmonth payback is very, it's very good; it's"},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"very unheard of."},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"And os, that's the first step; I would encourage\nall businesses and residents to take advantage"},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"of that program."},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"The next step is something people don't think\nof, but I would really encourage people to"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"shop local."},"396":{"dur":4,"text":"Support your local community, keep the dollars\nin the community, but then also, that cuts"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"down on transportation costs."},"402":{"dur":4,"text":"That cuts down on pollution, cuts down on\ngasoline usage, and carbon emissions."},"407":{"dur":5,"text":"Other steps businesses can take are your standard\n'reduce, reuse, recycle,' making sure to keep"},"412":{"dur":6,"text":"as many items out of the landfill; that can\nhelp with cutting that down, the carbon costs"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"on transporting the waste to the landfill."},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, that's another way businesses can\ngo green."},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"Very small and simple steps."},"426":{"dur":3,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nSo, not necessarily overhauling and redoing"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"everything in your building all at once."},"431":{"dur":1,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nNo."},"432":{"dur":6,"text":"When we work with a business, we will go through\npurchasing, and their entire supply of items,"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"and their electronic usage."},"441":{"dur":5,"text":"And if they have just purchased brand new\nitems that aren't energy star or energy efficient,"},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"we'll then assist them in writing a policy\nthat states that in the future, when buying"},"451":{"dur":4,"text":"new items, and then when the do an overhaul,\nthey will then purchase more eco-friendly"},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"items."},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"Because it's not very sustainable for a business\nto purchase all new items that are energy"},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"inefficient and toss the old ones."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it doesn't have to be a complete overhaul."},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"Small steps can make a big difference."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nSo, does your organization, you're dealing"},"469":{"dur":4,"text":"with more mid and smaller businesses, not\nlarge industries, correct?"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nYes, that is correct."},"475":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"476":{"dur":5,"text":"So, talk about some of the, there's two organizations\nin our region here in Charleston and Mattoon,"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"tell us about those and what they're doing,\nand how you're helping them."},"484":{"dur":1,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nYeah."},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we are currently working with the Lumpkin\nFamily Foundation and the Charleston Chamber"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"of Commerce."},"490":{"dur":4,"text":"The Charleston Chamber of Commerce is recently\nenrolled, so the first step of the process"},"495":{"dur":4,"text":"for them right now is going through our checklist,\nour green business checklist and the assessment"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"of that checklist."},"501":{"dur":5,"text":"And we have three different branches of our\nprogram, and that covers office and retail,"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"restaurant and cafe, and then hotel and hospitality."},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"Because each sector has different needs and\nrequirements, and can become more environmentally"},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"friendly in different ways."},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"So, they'll go through office and retail checklist."},"517":{"dur":5,"text":"And in that checklist, there are nine sections,\nabout 270 items, that they'll look through."},"522":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the first step for them is to be kind\nof going through the list, seeing what are"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"they doing right now, what do they want to\ndo in the future, maybe what's not the best"},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"for their business at this time."},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, that's a first step for the Chamber\nof Commerce."},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"And they already have talked about doing energy\nefficient lighting, cutting down on their"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"utility bill, and then engaging the community."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"They really want to highlight that through\ntheir programs, because they do a lot in this"},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"area, and they want to make sure that that's,\nthat they can incorporate sustainability into"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"those practices."},"551":{"dur":4,"text":"The Lumpkin Family Foundation; they're doing\na lot in terms of sustainable transportation"},"556":{"dur":7,"text":"for their employees, for the foundation itself\nwhen they travel for businesses, along with"},"563":{"dur":5,"text":"practices within the building, for program\nawareness, really, program awareness in terms"},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"of engaging their employees."},"570":{"dur":6,"text":"So, having a very comprehensive, green business\npolicy handbook that all the employees, upon"},"576":{"dur":5,"text":"being hired by the Family Foundation, they\nhave to sign on and agree to these policies."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"They have a quarterly green warrior award."},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, they track the points of who does\nthe most environmentally friendly activities,"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"and then they receive recognition for those\nactivities."},"591":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nSo, it seems like, in addition to physical"},"594":{"dur":5,"text":"things like changing out the lighting, there's\nalso a, I don't know, a behavioral change"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're trying to implement, that's part\nof your program?"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nYes."},"602":{"dur":5,"text":"I would say over 50% of our items in our program\nare more behavioral change, because we strongly"},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"believe that, while energy efficient equipment\nis fantastic, it's great, if a business is"},"612":{"dur":5,"text":"not using those items in a more sustainable\nmanner, if you don't engage in behavior change,"},"617":{"dur":5,"text":"then you can, then those savings and those\npositive impacts aren't necessarily seen."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"It's very important to change the culture\nof a business."},"626":{"dur":3,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nSo, Lumpkin and the Chamber are more of the"},"629":{"dur":4,"text":"office related; what are some of the, you\nsaid there's the food service industry, like"},"633":{"dur":4,"text":"those people, what are some of the things,\nlike, that they would be looking at, if it's"},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"a restaurant, in terms of energy savings and\nbecoming more green?"},"641":{"dur":1,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nYeah."},"642":{"dur":5,"text":"For restaurants, we focus on buying organic,\nbuying local, buying fair-trade if possible."},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"So really, on the purchasing side; that's\nreally where you'll see a big difference between"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"the office and retail and the restaurant\/cafe,\nis the purchasing aspect."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"Then also, how they use those resources."},"658":{"dur":5,"text":"But a lot of the businesses are doing those\npractices already, with restaurants: rotating"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"their stock to make sure it's kept fresh,\nthere's no waste."},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"Things of that nature."},"667":{"dur":6,"text":"Along with supporting, whether it's through\nstocking locally grown items or partnering"},"674":{"dur":5,"text":"with farmers to encourage them to create a\nmarket for locally grown in the area."},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"That's where yo'll see a big difference in\nthe restaurant\/cafe to the office and retail"},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"section."},"684":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nSo, for someone like the Charleston Chamber,"},"687":{"dur":4,"text":"how long does that process take by the time\nyou guys come in and they look through this"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"big checklist of stuff to get that all implemented?"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"What's the average time to implement?"},"695":{"dur":3,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nI would say it, that's a very good question,"},"698":{"dur":4,"text":"and I get that every time I talk to a business\nwho is possibly interested in enrolling in"},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"our program."},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"And that really depends on the business."},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"Three to six months is average."},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"Three months, I think, is the fastest we've\nseen a business go through, so that's the"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"idea."},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"But we do act as a consultant to the business."},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"We've worked with accounting firms, and they\nhave approached us saying, \"You know, it's"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"tax season."},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"We need to put, to table this for a month\nor so.\""},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, then we'll re-approach it."},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"There's no time limit on how long they can\nstay in the certification program."},"733":{"dur":4,"text":"They go through at their own pace, and they\nimplement things as they go along."},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"And it can take a while because it's such\na comprehensive list."},"742":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, we collect verifications for each\nitem, proof of each green practice."},"747":{"dur":4,"text":"So, whether that's documentation of their,\nreceipts of their organic foods purchased,"},"752":{"dur":5,"text":"or a copy of the green employee handbook that's\nsigned by all the employees and the staff,"},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"or photos of the energy efficient lighting."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"That way, we can come back green washing."},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"ARe you familiar with the term 'green washing?'"},"763":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nNo, tell us about that."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nGreen washing is where people falsely advertise"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"as being environmentally friendly."},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"For example, you'll commonly see a sock or\nitem of clothing saying that it's reusable,"},"774":{"dur":5,"text":"or made from reusable items, and then you'll\nlook and it will say 5% of this is made from"},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"bamboo."},"780":{"dur":5,"text":"Is 5% of it really make that a reused item,\na reusable item?"},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"In our opinion, it does not."},"788":{"dur":6,"text":"And so, we use our certification to create\na known and a verified standard of business"},"794":{"dur":5,"text":"practice that people can recognize is truly\nenvironmentally friendly, that the business"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"is upholding to those standards."},"802":{"dur":4,"text":"And if people are curious and they want to\ninquire, we will send the verification proof"},"806":{"dur":4,"text":"to them, and they can see this how 'a, b,\nand c' the business is going through and they"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"are a green business."},"811":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nSo then, how many of those verifications does"},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"a business have before they get the certification\nfrom you?"},"818":{"dur":1,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nVery good question."},"819":{"dur":5,"text":"So, when they go through the checklist, they\nhave to accomplish 50% of the items and apply"},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"them."},"826":{"dur":5,"text":"We leave a lot of flexibility because some\nbusinesses, larger groups, we certified Busey"},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"Bank, and they were a larger business, and\nthey were able to have the capital to do a"},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"lot of energy efficiency upgrades."},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"And they could do a lot of those more technological\nupgrades."},"841":{"dur":4,"text":"A smaller business may not have, a mom and\npop store may not have that, those dollars"},"845":{"dur":1,"text":"on hand to do that."},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we have other options like education and\nemployee engagement."},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it's a checklist that is tailored to the\nbusinesses."},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"They can choose their own green path to become\ncertified."},"857":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that checklist you said had how many,\nabout how many things?"},"861":{"dur":1,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\n270 items on it."},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"So, on average they'll complete 140, 135."},"864":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"865":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, you complete that, and then what's\nnext?"},"869":{"dur":6,"text":"You get the certification, and does that qualify\nyou for, you know, discounts on things, or"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, what does that do for the business?"},"877":{"dur":1,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nYeah."},"878":{"dur":3,"text":"So, once they're certified, then we'll market\ntheir business through our marketing avenues"},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"and our marketing department as a green certified\nbusiness."},"884":{"dur":3,"text":"It goes out to our newsletter, all of our\nsocial media outlets."},"888":{"dur":4,"text":"We'll assist them in creating marketing packages\njust for that business alone."},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"They'll have access to our logo."},"895":{"dur":4,"text":"We have gone into grants with other businesses\nand non-profits who have finished our program,"},"900":{"dur":1,"text":"because of the partnership we formed."},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"So, there's that opportunity, as well."},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, every three months, every quarter,\nwe'll go in and check in with the business"},"908":{"dur":3,"text":"to make sure they're still fulfilling those\ngreen practices."},"912":{"dur":1,"text":"And what do they want us to see?"},"913":{"dur":5,"text":"Do they need assistance with energy efficiency,\nor water efficiency, or in composting more?"},"919":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we're their go-to green consultants for,\nafter the period of time that they're certified."},"923":{"dur":3,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nAnd then, does that, once they're certified,"},"927":{"dur":1,"text":"does the process kind of evolve?"},"928":{"dur":5,"text":"Do they sort of revisit that checklist and\nsay, well, now these things apply, and then"},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"look at more ways of becoming more green,\nI guess."},"937":{"dur":1,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nYeah."},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"They will do that, they can do that throughout\nthe entire process, and afterwards if they"},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"so choose."},"943":{"dur":3,"text":"But after three years, they have to go through\nre-certification."},"946":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the certification has a time limit."},"949":{"dur":4,"text":"And they can choose to go through again, we\nhope they do."},"953":{"dur":3,"text":"All of our businesses to-date have gone through\nre-certification."},"956":{"dur":4,"text":"And once they do that, the cost of re-certifying\nis half of the original cost."},"961":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, then that process, then once they\nstart the re-certification, we ask that they"},"965":{"dur":4,"text":"move up, you know, 10% more items, or 15%\nmore items."},"969":{"dur":4,"text":"That's very negotiable, but we do hope that\nthey will then become more environmentally"},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"friendly, and not just receiving credit for\nthe items they are currently performing."},"977":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nWell, you had mentioned before Busey Bank"},"979":{"dur":7,"text":"as one of your larger businesses, it has several\nbanks throughout the region."},"987":{"dur":4,"text":"Talk about what they did, and what kind of\nreturn they're seeing on their, I guess, I"},"992":{"dur":2,"text":"mean, they're talking about businesses and\nreturn on investments."},"994":{"dur":1,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nYep, are in line."},"995":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes."},"996":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori CAsey:\nTalk about what they did, and what their process"},"998":{"dur":1,"text":"was like."},"999":{"dur":1,"text":">>Ryan Wolber:\nSo, they actually, we certified Busey Bank"},"1001":{"dur":3,"text":"headquarters and
