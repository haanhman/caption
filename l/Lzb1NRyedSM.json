{"0":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have a session this afternoon."},"3":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't have my piece of paper\nactually on what the exact title is."},"10":{"dur":1,"text":"On networking disciplines."},"12":{"dur":5,"text":"And, first of all, I'd like to thank\nmy colleague Katie Ross in economics,"},"17":{"dur":4,"text":"who actually, organized this session."},"21":{"dur":3,"text":"And, from my view point as an economist,"},"25":{"dur":3,"text":"this is remarkably a multidisciplinary,\nsession."},"29":{"dur":2,"text":"And, that word's used a lot."},"31":{"dur":2,"text":"The chancellor was using it this morning."},"33":{"dur":4,"text":"And particularly for people in economics,\nthey're very, nervous about that."},"37":{"dur":3,"text":"All right?\nAnd, you know even publishing in PNAS,"},"41":{"dur":1,"text":"i mean, what does that count for,\nyou know?"},"43":{"dur":4,"text":"That's not really\nan economics journal right."},"47":{"dur":4,"text":"[LAUGH] And, at the same time some\neconomists are reaching out, you know."},"51":{"dur":4,"text":"Berkart Skipper's been involved\nin neuroscience, this morning's,"},"56":{"dur":3,"text":"taught by Brenda McCowan, one of her\nco authors of one of the papers is"},"60":{"dur":5,"text":"Oscar Jorder who is a macro, monetary\neconomist in the Economics Department."},"65":{"dur":5,"text":"But the main reason I'm bringing this up\nis that we have three speakers today."},"70":{"dur":4,"text":"Two of them really, multidisciplinary in,\ncross disciplinary."},"74":{"dur":4,"text":"So one, Susan Athey is an economist\nwho has worked a lot with,"},"80":{"dur":1,"text":"people in other disciplines."},"81":{"dur":4,"text":"And the other, Raisa D'souza, who I'll\nintroduce later, is also really working,"},"86":{"dur":7,"text":"across the disciplines, and, you know, and"},"94":{"dur":3,"text":"this is one of the hopes, is, and actually\none of the interesting issues, you know."},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"We're looking at big data,\nwe're looking at networks."},"99":{"dur":3,"text":"People outside the social sciences\nreally developed those skills."},"103":{"dur":2,"text":"To what extent will we,\njust bring them in house and"},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"do it all on their own and\nto what extent will we reach out and, and"},"109":{"dur":3,"text":"actually work with people in other\ndisciplines who are using these methods."},"112":{"dur":1,"text":"We'll see how it goes."},"114":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, so first of all i would like\nto introduce, our first speaker,"},"118":{"dur":3,"text":"Susan Athey, who's the Economics\nof Technology Professor"},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"at the Stanford Graduate School\nof Business."},"123":{"dur":4,"text":"She has a PhD in economics many research\ninterests including internet, options,"},"128":{"dur":1,"text":"econometrics, and machine learning."},"131":{"dur":5,"text":"She has reached out, she for a while\nwas Chief Economist at Microsoft and"},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"for quite a while has been\na consultant at Microsoft, and"},"140":{"dur":3,"text":"that's really, influenced her research and"},"143":{"dur":4,"text":"interaction with others, and also,\ninfluenced, the people she's working with."},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"She's won many awards including member\nof the National Academy of Sciences and"},"152":{"dur":5,"text":"American Academy of Arts and\nSciences, but in addition,"},"157":{"dur":3,"text":"economics is really,\nreally tough on giving out awards."},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, i don't really understand why,\ni don't see how it helps the discipline."},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"But there is one award given by\nthe American Economic Association."},"169":{"dur":6,"text":"The John Bastes, John Bates Clark award is\ngiven not every year but every other year"},"175":{"dur":4,"text":"to that American economist under the age\nof 40, who is adjudged to have made"},"179":{"dur":4,"text":"the most significant contribution to\neconomic thought and knowledge and"},"183":{"dur":3,"text":"Susan Athey has won that award, so\nwe\u2019re very delighted to have her speaking."},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you [APPLAUSE]\n>> Thanks so much and"},"189":{"dur":7,"text":"thanks for putting together"},"196":{"dur":4,"text":"such a wonderful conference, i was,\ntalking with, Matt Jackson earlier and"},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"said you know, one thing, one rule\ni think I've learned from today is,"},"204":{"dur":4,"text":"you never wanna go on stage after\nsomeone who has 750,000 YouTube hits."},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"[LAUGH] So, you know,\nwe'll all just have to do our best."},"212":{"dur":1,"text":"That was really fabulous."},"213":{"dur":1,"text":"I really enjoyed your presentation."},"214":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm, so, I'm gonna talk to today\nabout a different type of network,"},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"a market network where\nthe interactions of the individuals"},"225":{"dur":5,"text":"are not as much social interactions but\nactually competitive interactions."},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"And, so this, in some sense,\nthis observation that you can think about"},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"markets as networks is an old one and\nthere are, you know,"},"238":{"dur":4,"text":"a variety of economic studies over\nthe years that have taken that, that tack,"},"242":{"dur":4,"text":"but i would say that the sort\nof micro economics of the,"},"247":{"dur":4,"text":"especially that part that's been sort of\nsteadying some of the modern platform"},"251":{"dur":4,"text":"markets, like eBay and so on,\nhaven't really, taken that approach and so"},"256":{"dur":5,"text":"today I'm gonna be talking about bringing\ntogether some tools from economics for"},"261":{"dur":4,"text":"studying competitive behavior with,\nwith networks."},"266":{"dur":4,"text":"So i wanna, i wanna start out actually\nby talking about, A\/B tests and"},"270":{"dur":6,"text":"experimentation in general, and that's\ngonna segue into the, the network idea."},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"So one of the things that,\nif, for those of us who have"},"280":{"dur":4,"text":"been sort of collaborating with, with tech\nfirms and, and doing experiments we've,"},"284":{"dur":4,"text":"we've observed that, A\/B testing,\nthat is randomized controlled trials,so"},"289":{"dur":4,"text":"that if you're a tech firm you call\na randomized controlled tile an A\/B test,"},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"has become incredibly important for\nbusiness and business practice."},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"So, something,\nsomebody like Google will run 10,000 or"},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"more randomized controlled\ntrials every year,"},"305":{"dur":5,"text":"nothing changes on a website like\nAmazon or Google without an A\/B test."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay?\nSo this is actually a,"},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"a really important phenomenon for\nour society."},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"It also is affecting, governments and"},"318":{"dur":4,"text":"development organizations who\nare trying to also, test the effects of"},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"all sorts of policy interventions,\nand, and really, technology and, and"},"327":{"dur":5,"text":"digitization has made it possible\nto do that on a much larger scale."},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"We also see that in,in newspapers and"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"everybody else who's\nproviding our information."},"337":{"dur":5,"text":"So, one of the, the observations, though,\nabout how these, these tests are run and,"},"342":{"dur":6,"text":"and what they do is that they actually,\nreally miss out on a lot."},"348":{"dur":4,"text":"So, a typical A\/B test at Google would,"},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"would test sort of two different\nversions of a search algorithm."},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"And the way they would do\nthe randomization, is they'll take, say,"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"one percent of users or half a percent\nof users as they come on to Google and"},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"they'll allocate them\ninto a treatment group."},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"They're actually going to be running\nhundreds of experiments at the same time."},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a little more complicated than that,\nbut so,"},"370":{"dur":4,"text":"you're much more likely to be in an\nexperiment than you are a control group."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"But you're gonna get\nallocated on a user basis."},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"This is something that you\ncan learn very very quickly."},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"Should i use a different color blue?"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"Should i change my fonts?"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"Should i re-rank out my\nresults in a different way?"},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"And i can very very quickly\nlearn about that in a day or so."},"388":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm gonna have a result, I'll have\na significant a significant result, and"},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"i can decide to, to roll out and\nrelease these new features."},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"It's actually really important for\ninnovation, because say, at a company life"},"400":{"dur":4,"text":"Facebook, pretty much anybody can,\ncan change the code of Facebook."},"404":{"dur":4,"text":"An intern can change the code that\nproduces what you see on Facebook."},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"And so how do you, how do you allow that\nkind of decentralized rapid innovation?"},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"Where you have a very objective\nway to evaluate that impact."},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"And that is to put it through an A\/B test."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"And if it looks good,\nthen you ship that, you ship that code,"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"you release it to the wild immediately."},"424":{"dur":5,"text":"So it's really kind of central to the way\ninnovation happens in these large firms."},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you're going to be testing users,\nit's very cheap,"},"433":{"dur":5,"text":"very easy, you're not really going to\nhave a good idea of how those tests"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"affect the businesses that\nare operating on your platform."},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you're eBay,\nyou have two sides of the market,"},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"you have users and you have,\nand you have sellers."},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"If you're a search engine,\nyou have users and you have advertisers."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're Amazon you'll have,\nyou know, the users and"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll have the third party sellers and\nso on."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"Facebook would have users and advertisers."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's very easy to test what users like."},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"But trying to understand,\nadvertiser responses or"},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"seller responses is a much\nmore difficult problem."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":">> And it's these agents\nthat i wanna focus on today."},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"So, interestingly even though it's,\nit's, seems,"},"472":{"dur":5,"text":"should be like sorta obvious to everyone\nthat randomizing at the user level-"},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"Is not a good way to learn about\nadvertiser seller response."},"481":{"dur":4,"text":"That is the standard practice\nin every major tech firm."},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"So what you would typically\ndo is you might say, okay,"},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to do something that's\ngoing to re-rank my sellers."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to make lower priced\nsellers appear higher on eBay,"},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"something like that."},"495":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm going to take particular types of\nadvertisers and rank them higher in,"},"499":{"dur":5,"text":"in, beside your search results,\nand I'm gonna experiment on users."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"So what's gonna happen\nis each advertiser or"},"507":{"dur":5,"text":"each seller is only gonna see about 1% of\ntheir traffic affected by the experiment,"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"which is like background noise to them."},"515":{"dur":4,"text":"So the, from the seller perspective,\nthis experiment really didn't happen."},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we're gonna learn\nis how the users respond."},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"So we can see if i put you know,\nlow price sellers higher on eBay,"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"i can see how much more the users click,\nhow much more the users buy."},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"So i can learn about the user effects."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"But I've no idea what happens to the,\nto the, to the sellers, but"},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"it's very common just to look at\nthe metrics and say, oh gee i got"},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"this many more sales, without actually\ntaking into account that the sellers might"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"later change their prices or changed\ntheir behavior or you can quit eBay."},"544":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay so, with advertisers like what\nmight happen, is the first of all,"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"the advertisers are going\nto notice the effect."},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"Second of all,"},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"the advertisers will influence each other\neven if they don\u2019t change their behavior."},"558":{"dur":5,"text":"So if i take one advertiser and put it up\nhigh on the page they're gonna get lots"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"of clicks and they're gonna, they're ha,\ntherefore have to spend a lot of money and"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"if they have a budget they\nmight run out of money."},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"If they run out of money they're off\nthe page and that's gonna lead another"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"advertiser to go to the top position and\nthen they might run out of money, too."},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's interaction effects,"},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"even if the advertisers don't\nchange anything at all."},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"But then of course in an economic world,"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"they have incentives to change what they\ndo if you change the way the market works."},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"And so indeed they'll change that as well."},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"And so\nall of those things are generally ignored."},"591":{"dur":0,"text":"So why are they ignored?"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not that people are stupid."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's actually that\nit's just very hard and"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"very expensive to do\nsomething other than this."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"The user experiments are really cheap."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me kind of give a general framework\nfor thinking about these kinds of"},"603":{"dur":4,"text":"problems and that is to think about\nthese marketplaces as bipartite graphs."},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is gonna, I'm gonna use the word\nseller for, for sellers or advertisers,"},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"just, just have one term."},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"In but all in e-commerce marketplaces\nas well as online advertising sellers"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"are going to compete with each\nother to attract user attention and"},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"ultimately purchases."},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"And so users or consumers on these\nplatforms are going to enter queries or"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"select products from a menu,"},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"and the platform is going to use\nvarious algorithms for ranking them."},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"So the economic market design problem for\nthe platform and"},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"that's who the economists often think from\nthe platform's perspective they're going"},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"to try to figure out what are the ways to\nrank sellers that get the most consumers"},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"to my marketplace that keep the sellers\nhappy in my marketplace and so on."},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"And there, the tools they have or\nthe little dials they turn,"},"649":{"dur":6,"text":"would be things like fees for listings,\nfees for clicks, or, percentages of sales."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"So just to see how this might work,\nyou know, suppose I'm shopping for"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"my kids on eBay."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"And, first of all they say, oh Mommy i\nwant a \"How to Train Your Dragon\" costume,"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"so i can look on eBay for\n\"How to Train Your Dragon\" costumes."},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"Then my, my little one might see me\nsearching for my middle one and say,"},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"oh no, no mommy you were searching for\ncostumes, i want a \"Frozen\" costume."},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"So f might also search for\nFrozen costumes."},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we might start thinking\nabout toys and search for"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"\"How to Train Your Dragon\" toys."},"682":{"dur":4,"text":"So all three of these search queries are\nqueries that could be entered by a user."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"And so eBay is gonna show a set of\nsellers in response to each one."},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"But, of course, there's gonna be overlap."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"People who sell How to Train Your Dragon\ncostumes also sell How to"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"Train Your Dragon toys."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"But then there's people who\nspecialize in costumes and"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"people who specialize in toys."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is going to lead to,"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"a bipartite graph where I've\ngot two types of, of guys."},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"I've got sellers and"},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"they're competing because they're\nboth showing up on the same query."},"711":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, the sellers, some sellers might\nshow up on both query A and query C."},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"Some sellers show up on query A and\nquery B Some might show up on B and"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"C, some might show up on all of them,"},"722":{"dur":4,"text":"and this is going to lead to\ninteractions among all of them."},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"So one thing that's really cool about\nthis is that actually i can measure this."},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"I can measure this directly and"},"731":{"dur":5,"text":"actually as the the marketplace designer,\ni can control this, i can manipulate it."},"737":{"dur":4,"text":"So, unlike, kind of, social networks where\nwe think of them as being sort of more"},"742":{"dur":4,"text":"organic, and, and we can manipulate them\nsomewhat i can put a monkey in the cage."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"But on here I've,\nI've sort of got my monkeys but"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"i can actually manipulate you know,\nhow close friends they are, if you like."},"752":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay."},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"And that, that's a, a really\ninteresting and powerful methodology."},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"But it's one, this is one that's really\nbeen explored from this perspective"},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"in a only very little way across\nall of the disciplines that are,"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"that are engaging with\nthese tech companies."},"767":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay."},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me tell you,\nquickly sort of, this is, and"},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"this is a real world problem\ni should say that, you know,"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"I've, this is been a focus of a number\nof years of consulting for me."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm sort of telling you stories about,\npartly based on my experience with that."},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"So there's sort of three types of\nsolutions to dealing with this problems."},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"The first two are to continue\nto do your user experiments but"},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"to try to do a better job with them."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll, and I'll touch on those,\nI'll touch on the first one briefly,"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"talk a little bit more about the second\none, and then the third one is the one"},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"that, it really uses the network\nscience most deeply."},"802":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the first is to just modify your\nevaluation of short-term user experiments."},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is where an economist or\na social scientist can come in."},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"So just, actually, by the way, if those of\ninterested like how does social sciences"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"add value to, to the hundreds of\nmachine learning people in a tech firm,"},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"well this slide is a very\nsimple example of how"},"820":{"dur":4,"text":"one social scientist can have\na very large impact, very easily."},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"So you conceptualize the problem and"},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"you attempt to address it\nwith alternative measures."},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"So, for example, on,\nin search, an advertiser's"},"833":{"dur":4,"text":"bid is going to be responsive to how,\nwhat the quality of their clicks are."},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"That is, if I'm selling auto insurance and\nyou put me up on, and you put my ad up"},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"when somebody searches for dental floss,\nthen the person might click on my ad,"},"846":{"dur":4,"text":"but I'm not going to sell very much auto\ninsurance so that's a low quality click."},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"On the other hand, if they put\nme up on somebody searching for"},"853":{"dur":3,"text":"car insurance,\nthat might lead to a high quality click."},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"And so if you ignore advertiser behavior\nthen you are going to be very tempted if"},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"you're especially if you need to, like,"},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"make more money this quarter like\nYahoo did for a number of quarters."},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"You might be very tempted to put auto\ninsurance ads on dental floss queries."},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"Because in the experiment it's going to\nlook like it's going to make you a lot of"},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"money because the auto insurance\nguy's paying 30 dollars a click."},"877":{"dur":4,"text":"So you get a few more clicks, that's very\nnice, except for later on you think they"},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"might lower their bids if you keep\nthrowing them up against dental floss."},"884":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay."},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"So they, but that will never show up in a\nuser level experiment cause the advertiser"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"won't actually see the change and\nrespond to it."},"891":{"dur":4,"text":"So one way to kind of avoid this\ninnovating in the wrong direction"},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"is to change what you measure."},"897":{"dur":3,"text":"So if, of course, if i put up auto\ninsurance on dental floss, then somebody"},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"clicks on the ad, they're very likely\njust to click, to click right back"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"to the dental floss query cuz they weren't\nreally interested in auto insurance."},"907":{"dur":4,"text":"So what i can do is that even though i\nactually made money from that click."},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"When i count the money i made from the\nexperiment I'm through that money away,"},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not gonna count it,\nI'm gonna say that's bad money."},"918":{"dur":3,"text":"That is bad money in the sense\nthat that's not sustainable money."},"921":{"dur":3,"text":"And so when i evaluate the experiment\nI'm only gonna count good clicks."},"924":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is also something that you know,\nI'd advise to news media organizations as"},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"well, when they start becoming data\ndriven, there's a temptation to put,"},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"like, kind of junky headlines and so on."},"935":{"dur":1,"text":"You've all seen more and\nmore of this, right,"},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"like you've got weird in all\nthe newspaper headlines these days."},"940":{"dur":3,"text":"The weird thing you found out about this,\nthat's because people click on that, but"},"943":{"dur":2,"text":"it doesn't really make you like\nthe New York Times in the long term."},"945":{"dur":2,"text":"So we'd throw away those, those,\nthose clicks and not count them even"},"948":{"dur":2,"text":"though the New York Times in\nthe short run makes money from them."},"951":{"dur":3,"text":"A second example of this is that\nadvertisers spending is gonna respond to"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"the return on investment and so\nyou can say, you can just tell the, the,"},"959":{"dur":3,"text":"the engineers you know you cannot\nbuild algorithms that, that- For"},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"whatever reason raise price is for\nadvertisers."},"965":{"dur":1,"text":"You're just, you're not allowed to do it."},"967":{"dur":2,"text":"You, you're, you're,\nyou have to solve a constrained problem."},"969":{"dur":2,"text":"You can try to improve\nyour ranking algorithms,"},"971":{"dur":3,"text":"but if it raises prices we're\nnot gonna ship that product."},"975":{"dur":2,"text":"That's also of course a very\nlimiting thing to do, but"},"977":{"dur":4,"text":"it's a way to to, to sort of prevent\nyourself from harming the marketplace."},"982":{"dur":2,"text":"Now as you can see these types\nof solutions, they can help,"},"984":{"dur":3,"text":"they're sort of a band-aid, but\nthey're not really a fundamental solution."},"988":{"dur":3,"text":"So the second thing, and\nthis is actually really the bread and"},"991":{"dur":3,"text":"butter of economics, but\nalmost no other science."},"995":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is where we're kind of unique and\nweird I would say,"},"998":{"dur":3,"text":"is that economist's actually believe\nthat we can build models and"},"1002":{"dur":4,"text":"make predictions about counter factual\nworlds that nobody has seen before."},"1006":{"dur":3,"text":"So you know, many people think\nwe're quacks for doing this."},"1010":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, people inside economics\nthink that we're quacks for"},"1013":{"dur":3,"text":"doing that as well, but\nit is something that we try to do and"},"1017":{"dur":3,"text":"we have at least a, a set of,\nof well, a pretty well defined

simple"},"1029":{"dur":4,"text":"model that relates short term\noutcomes to long term responses."},"1033":{"dur":4,"text":"The second is to, to do something more\ncomplicated we call a structural model,"},"1038":{"dur":3,"text":"where we actually write down\na functional form equation for"},"1041":{"dur":4,"text":"what somebody's objectives are, and then\nassume that they follow those objectives."},"1046":{"dur":4,"text":"And so if we change their environment, we,\nif we know what their utility function is,"},"1050":{"dur":3,"text":"we can predict what they'll do to\nmaximize that utility or even solve for"},"1053":{"dur":0,"text":"a new equilibrium."},"1054":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay?"},"1055":{"dur":3,"text":"So just to give some\nexamples of each of these,"},"1058":{"dur":4,"text":"here' s an experiment that I ran on\nBing where I, I swapped search results."},"1063":{"dur":3,"text":"So I tried do see what would happen if you\ntook the thing in the first position and"},"1066":{"dur":3,"text":"moved it down tot he third postilion, or\nmoved it down to the fifth position, or"},"1070":{"dur":2,"text":"moved it down to the tenth, ten,\nthe, to the tenth position."},"1073":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what we found in this\nrandomized controlled experiment"},"1076":{"dur":3,"text":"was that you lose about half\nyour clicks a little more"},"1079":{"dur":3,"text":"than half your clicks if you move from\nthe top position to the third position."},"1083":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay?\nAnd of course,"},"1084":{"dur":2,"text":"this is a very big policy issue right now,\nas well."},"1088":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is a, a general effect,"},"1089":{"dur":4,"text":"but you might imagine that this\neffect is really quite heterogeneous."},"1094":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the effect of re-ranking\nstuff is gonna matter a lot."},"1097":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, if you know what you're looking for,\nif you type in Bank of

third position."},"1104":{"dur":4,"text":"So in fact, in our experiment, we threw\nout those really, really clear queries,"},"1108":{"dur":3,"text":"because that was just viewed as\nunacceptable to the user, and,"},"1112":{"dur":2,"text":"but even within queries that\nare not quite that clear cut,"},"1115":{"dur":3,"text":"there often is something that,\nthat could be more or less navigational."},"1119":{"dur":1,"text":"That can be more or\nless clear where you wanna go."},"1120":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's other types\nof effects as well."},"1122":{"dur":3,"text":"So, in some work with [INAUDIBLE]\nwe've been working on modifying"},"1126":{"dur":4,"text":"machine learning methods to try to, to\nestimate heterogeneity in causal effects."},"1130":{"dur":3,"text":"So this actually requires changing\nmachine learning methodology because"},"1134":{"dur":3,"text":"that methodology is designed to predict\noutcomes, not to predict causal effects."},"1138":{"dur":2,"text":"And causal effects are actually,\nthere's no ground truth."},"1141":{"dur":0,"text":"So I don't know for"},"1142":{"dur":3,"text":"any of you in the audience exactly\nwhat your personal causal effect is."},"1145":{"dur":2,"text":"Therefore, traditional\nmachine learning methods,"},"1148":{"dur":3,"text":"which work on trying to predict people's\noutcomes using observed outcomes"},"1152":{"dur":2,"text":"as a ground truth don't\nwork exactly right."},"1154":{"dur":2,"text":"So I won't go through all the,\nthe details of that."},"1156":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a the National Academy\nhad a recent symposium and"},"1160":{"dur":2,"text":"I have a talk on that that's\navailable there if you're interested."},"1162":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm just gonna show you now, applying that\nmethod to the search the search example"},"1168":{"dur":3,"text":"we're using a machine learning\nmethod called regression trees,"},"1171":{"dur":4,"text":"except for modified to predict causal\neffects rather than just predict outcomes."},"1176":{"dur":4,"text":"And so what we get when we apply this\nmethod is that we get a partition of"},"1180":{"dur":5,"text":"the query space into subsets, and within\neach subset we estimate a causal effect."},"1186":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we're able to see, for\nexample, if the query is classified"},"1189":{"dur":3,"text":"to be a good candidate for images and\nalso to be likely to be about celebrities,"},"1193":{"dur":3,"text":"there was no effect of re

don't really care about\nthe informational query."},"1203":{"dur":2,"text":"The results, but for\nother types of queries,"},"1206":{"dur":3,"text":"there was actually a very large effect,\neven larger than average, for"},"1209":{"dur":4,"text":"example things that were, that were rated\nto be related to Wikipedia references,"},"1214":{"dur":2,"text":"more informational queries\nhad a much larger effect."},"1217":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, we can then, the,\neach row here is a subset of the sample."},"1222":{"dur":4,"text":"We can actually estimate the treatment\neffects in each part of the sample, and we"},"1227":{"dur":4,"text":"can then use that to under, to do a much\nbetter job predicting what's gonna happen."},"1231":{"dur":0,"text":"Cuz we can say,"},"1232":{"dur":4,"text":"well, you know, here is some here is some\nbranch where there's a really big effect."},"1236":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I can try to understand,\nwell are, did those types of advertisers,"},"1240":{"dur":1,"text":"are they very sensitive to quality?"},"1242":{"dur":1,"text":"Are they very active?"},"1244":{"dur":5,"text":"There, there's more likely to be a big\na big response by the advertisers in,"},"1249":{"dur":2,"text":"in those parts of the,\nof the of the space."},"1254":{"dur":4,"text":"So, this is obviously sort of, it doesn't\nrequire a lot of assumptions, but,"},"1259":{"dur":1,"text":"it's also very limited."},"1260":{"dur":3,"text":"I can say qualitatively whether\na particular change is likely to affect"},"1263":{"dur":3,"text":"a particular type of advertiser and\nwhether that's gonna have an effect, but"},"1267":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm not gonna be able to be,\ndo a very good job of putting quantitative"},"1270":{"dur":2,"text":"responses on exactly how much\nof an effect it's going to have."},"1273":{"dur":2,"text":"So, a second approach that I've used,"},"1275":{"dur":3,"text":"is to actually build this\nfull structural model."},"1279":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're gonna assume in my first\npaper on this we assumed that the,"},"1282":{"dur":2,"text":"the advertisers maximized profits."},"1285":{"dur":3,"text":"It turned out that that model did\na pretty lousy job predicting behavior."},"1288":{"dur":4,"text":"So we then build a much more richer model\nwhere we allowed advertisers to have one"},"1293":{"dur":3,"text":"of a, of a dozen objective functions\nwith some of them trying to"},"1296":{"dur":3,"text":"get to the top position, some of\nthem had budget constraints, and so"},"1300":{"dur":4,"text":"we actually used the fact that we were\nconstantly experimenting on every week."},"1304":{"dur":4,"text":"We're changing something about how\nthe system works and we have lots and"},"1309":{"dur":1,"text":"lots of stimuli."},"1310":{"dur":3,"text":"And if we see the same person\nresponding to ten different stimuli,"},"1314":{"dur":3,"text":"we can classify which\ntype of person they are."},"1317":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, we, we, use this behavioral model,\nand then we have to go back and"},"1322":{"dur":5,"text":"try to calculate if I made some other\nchange that I've never made before,"},"1327":{"dur":2,"text":"how do I think they would respond?"},"1330":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's where we get into one of\nthe big network computational problems."},"1333":{"dur":5,"text":"My, my paper actually looks at a subset\nof the keyword Bids on the system,"},"1338":{"dur":4,"text":"I've got tens of millions of bids\nthat I'm modeling in my sample."},"1343":{"dur":5,"text":"That's a subset of all of the different\nkeyword bids in the dataset."},"1348":{"dur":3,"text":"So in principle I would be\ncomputing an equilibrium betwe-,"},"1352":{"dur":3,"text":"of a game between a couple\nof hundred million players."},"1356":{"dur":3,"text":"That's hard, you know,\nmy computers can't do that very well."},"1360":{"dur":4,"text":"But, if I can use something about the\nnetwork structure, to, to say that well,"},"1364":{"dur":5,"text":"really, you know, these they don't all the\nhundred million, or couple hundred million"},"1369":{"dur":4,"text":"don't care equally about the other couple\nhundred million, we can find communities"},"1374":{"dur":4,"text":"and segments and try to compute equilibria\nthere, and then try to reconnect them."},"1379":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'd say this area is,\nis very much open for"},"1381":{"dur":4,"text":"research how to compute large scale\nequilibrium in sort of a reasonable way."},"1386":{"dur":3,"text":"So we are doing it in a very hacky way for\nour paper cuz that's not the main point of"},"1390":{"dur":3,"text":"our paper, but it's a, it's a,\nsomething that is very useful for these,"},"1393":{"dur":2,"text":"these tech firms and\nit's gonna become more and more common for"},"1396":{"dur":3,"text":"all of people studying networks to\nhave these very, very big networks."},"1400":{"dur":1,"text":"To try to worry about."},"1401":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay?"},"1402":{"dur":4,"text":"So the last thing I'll mention,\ntalk about is network experimentation."},"1407":{"dur":3,"text":"And so in network experimentation,\nwe're trying to think about"},"1410":{"dur":2,"text":"actually running experiments\non the network itself and"},"1413":{"dur":4,"text":"really take advantage of, it's run, not\nuser experiments but cellar experiments."},"1418":{"dur":1,"text":"Directly experiment on them."},"1420":{"dur":4,"text":"So to do that the, the sort of way\nthat's developing in a, in a but rapidly"},"1425":{"dur":4,"text":"growing literature, is to think about\ngrouping my sellers into communities."},"1429":{"dur":3,"text":"Now I should say,\nthis is mostly applied to like Facebook,"},"1433":{"dur":1,"text":"not to my market networks."},"1434":{"dur":2,"text":"But for, for\nthe user networks where it's been applied."},"1437":{"dur":4,"text":"We, we group the sellers into communities,\nin, in, my seller context I'm going to"},"1442":{"dur":3,"text":"do it by taking a bipartite graph\nweighting links between advertisers and"},"1445":{"dur":3,"text":"queries using weights in terms\nof how much business they do."},"1450":{"dur":3,"text":"And the big problem I have is\nthat spillovers are large."},"1453":{"dur":2,"text":"There's it's not like there's just\nthe guys who do toys on Ebay and"},"1456":{"dur":2,"text":"just the guys over here who do laptops."},"1458":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a lot of people who\ncross over a lot of categories."},"1461":{"dur":2,"text":"On eBay and on Search."},"1463":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we do the experiment at the\ncluster level, watch them for a long time."},"1467":{"dur":1,"text":"So just to kind of see\nhow this might work,"},"1469":{"dur":2,"text":"I could run a community\ndetection algorithm."},"1471":{"dur":3,"text":"Something like, oops, is that,\nno, my fonts aren't messing up,"},"1474":{"dur":0,"text":"I thought they were okay."},"1475":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me see, am I gonna lose."},"1477":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, I'll see,\nI've got a PDF on here somewhere."},"1480":{"dur":3,"text":"So what the Newman Et Al algorithms\nare doing is they are trying to find"},"1484":{"dur":3,"text":"communities where there is lots of\ninteraction within a community and not"},"1488":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot across and these orange units are\nones that have a lot of spill overs, okay?"},"1492":{"dur":4,"text":"So then I am going to randomize at\nthe community level, and try to you know,"},"1497":{"dur":1,"text":"analyze that data."},"1498":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, I've got a bunch of problems."},"1500":{"dur":2,"text":"One is how do I deal with the spillovers?"},"1502":{"dur":1,"text":"My observations aren't\nactually independent."},"1504":{"dur":1,"text":"So, how do I do my statistics?"},"1506":{"dur":5,"text":"And also these kinds of designs make it\neasy to study, like, well, what would"},"1511":{"dur":3,"text":"happen if a whole community got treated or\nif a whole population got treated?"},"1514":{"dur":2,"text":"But they make it actually very hard\nto study pure effects, because most"},"1517":{"dur":3,"text":"people either had all their peers\ntreated or none of their peers treated."},"1520":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't see a lot of in between."},"1524":{"dur":4,"text":"So one, one, but, one approach to this,\nproposed recently by some computer"},"1528":{"dur":4,"text":"scientists, was to basically\ndefine being treated as having,"},"1533":{"dur":3,"text":"a, say over 60% of your neighbors treated."},"1536":{"dur":2,"text":"And then use propensity score\nweighting to adjust for"},"1538":{"dur":2,"text":"non-random assignment to this condition."},"1542":{"dur":4,"text":"But there's, this is really an open\nresearch area of how to do this, and"},"1546":{"dur":3,"text":"this is something that\nI've been working on."},"1549":{"dur":3,"text":"So let me briefly tell you about\nthe way that we've been studying,"},"1553":{"dur":3,"text":"testing hypotheses about\npeer effects in networks."},"1556":{"dur":3,"text":"So to do that, I first just need to really\nbriefly introduce the approach we would"},"1560":{"dur":4,"text":"use to studying networks if we were\nexperiments on networks if I just had"},"1566":{"dur":0,"text":"direct effects."},"1567":{"dur":1,"text":"So imagine I'm, I've got an experiment."},"1568":{"dur":3,"text":"I've got treated guys in yellow and\nthe control guys and"},"1572":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm trying to test hypotheses."},"1575":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the approach that has\nbeen growing in popularity"},"1578":{"dur":2,"text":"in doing this is something\ncalled randomization inference."},"1581":{"dur":1,"text":"This is how we can do the statistics."},"1583":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, the way it works,"},"1584":{"dur":2,"text":"is I can say I'm gonna have\npotential outcomes for each unit."},"1587":{"dur":2,"text":"Say, unit A, I saw him being treated."},"1590":{"dur":2,"text":"So Yi of one is his outcome\nif he was treated, but"},"1592":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't know what his outcome would have\nbeen if he'd been the control group, and"},"1595":{"dur":2,"text":"that's my fundamental problem for\ninference."},"1598":{"dur":3,"text":"Wi is his treatment assignment\nis one because he was treated."},"1602":{"dur":0,"text":"So now I can say,"},"1603":{"dur":5,"text":"well, what-, how can I figure out,\nwhat the affect of the treatment is?"},"1608":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, first of all, I can say what's my\npoint estimate of the treatment affect,"},"1612":{"dur":4,"text":"the average of the control guys\nis I've got two and four, the,"},"1617":{"dur":2,"text":"so the, the, the sum is six,\nthe average is three."},"1620":{"dur":5,"text":"In the, in the treatment group I've got,\nthree and five the average is eight."},"1625":{"dur":1,"text":"Oops, I, I flipped the sign there."},"1627":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to see what's the P value of,\noh, no, no."},"1630":{"dur":0,"text":"I did the opposite ones."},"1631":{"dur":2,"text":"Three, these are the real treatments so\nthree, two, five,"},"1634":{"dur":2,"text":"four are the real treatments and I want\nto understand what the P value is so"},"1637":{"dur":1,"text":"the treatment effect is negative two."},"1639":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the Randomization Inference\napproach says,"},"1641":{"dur":2,"text":"well under the null hypothesis\nthere is no effect of anything."},"1644":{"dur":4,"text":"I actually know what you're\noutcome would have been"},"1648":{"dur":1,"text":"if you hadn't gotten the treatment."},"1650":{"dur":3,"text":"Or I know what your outcome would have\nbeen if you had been in the control group."},"1653":{"dur":4,"text":"So I fill in under the null that\nyour outcome would have been"},"1657":{"dur":3,"text":"the same under either of those and that's\nwhat's called a sharp null hypothesis."},"1661":{"dur":4,"text":"A sharp null hypothesis is one where you\nknow exactly what would have happened in"},"1665":{"dur":6,"text":"the alternative treatment regime,\nwithout under the null hypothesis."},"1671":{"dur":4,"text":"And so then what I can do is I can say,\nwell I can imagine under the null,"},"1676":{"dur":3,"text":"it doesn't matter what the treatment\nassignments were, so I can think about"},"1679":{"dur":4,"text":"all sorts, redrawing in lots of different\nways what the treatment vectors are,"},"1684":{"dur":2,"text":"each of those, if it was equal\nprobability of treatment and control,"},"1686":{"dur":3,"text":"would have equal probability, and in each\ncase, I can figure out what the test"},"1690":{"dur":4,"text":"statistics would have been if those,\nthat had been the treatment assignment."},"1695":{"dur":3,"text":"So I know that these two guys were\ntreated and these were control."},"1698":{"dur":3,"text":"If I re-labelled them then I would\nget a different test statistic."},"1702":{"dur":5,"text":"But if I of course, if there's no effect\nthen that test statistic would be"},"1707":{"dur":3,"text":"just another estimate of what this\ntest statistic is under the null."},"1710":{"dur":2,"text":"I've got a full distribution,\nso I can say, you know,"},"1713":{"dur":2,"text":"the test statistic is less than\nnegative two a third of the time,"},"1715":{"dur":3,"text":"it's greater than two a third of the time,\nand that's gonna give me an,"},"1719":{"dur":2,"text":"that's actually gonna give me\na statistical significance level"},"1721":{"dur":3,"text":"that doesn't depend on large samples,\nit doesn't depend on anything really."},"1725":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it's quite general, so\nthis approach is gonna be really good for"},"1728":{"dur":3,"text":"working on networks where we might have,\nwe don't wanna make a lot of assumptions."},"1733":{"dur":4,"text":"But the problem is that\na lot of the assumption,"},"1737":{"dur":2,"text":"the hypothesis you might want to\ntest in networks aren't sharp."},"1740":{"dur":4,"text":"So if I want to say, I wanna imagine\ntests where there's peer effects,"},"1744":{"dur":2,"text":"the problem is that if\na treatment has an effect on me,"},"1747":{"dur":3,"text":"then I don't know what my outcome would\nhave been if I hadn't been treated."},"1750":{"dur":4,"text":"So these are what we call\nnon-sharp null hypotheses and so"},"1755":{"dur":4,"text":"in our recent paper what we do is we\ntry to actually figure out how to do"},"1759":{"dur":2,"text":"those types of things, So\nI'm going to, I'm gonna,"},"1761":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm running out of time I'm just going\nto give you one example that shows you"},"1766":{"dur":5,"text":"how we can turn a non-sharp hypotheses\ninto a sharp hypotheses and actually use"},"1771":{"dur":4,"text":"this this Fisher randomization inference\napproach for very complex hypothesis."},"1776":{"dur":1,"text":"Which allows us to then do correct"},"1778":{"dur":3,"text":"tests of very interesting experiments and\nnetworks."},"1782":{"dur":2,"text":"So here's my little network and what I'm,"},"1784":{"dur":2,"text":"what I'm gonna start by doing\nis picking two focal units A and"},"1787":{"dur":3,"text":"B, this guys treated, this guys\ncontrolled, the red ones are focal."},"1791":{"dur":4,"text":"And I want to test the hypothesis that\nfriends of friends don't have any impact,"},"1795":{"dur":2,"text":"that only your friends have an impact."},"1797":{"dur":4,"text":"So in order to test that hypotheses,\nI'm gonna first take my focal units and"},"1801":{"dur":4,"text":"take all of their direct friends and I'm\ngoing to call those buffer units, okay?"},"1806":{"dur":3,"text":"The buffer units are gonna\nbe their friends and"},"1809":{"dur":3,"text":"then the auxiliary units are gonna\nbe their friends of friends."},"1813":{"dur":4,"text":"And so under my no hypotheses that\nfriends of friends don't matter,"},"1818":{"dur":3,"text":"changes to the treatment\nstatus of the auxiliary units"},"1821":{"dur":3,"text":"should not affect the outcomes\nof my focal units."},"1825":{"dur":1,"text":"And so what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna take,"},"1827":{"dur":2,"text":"instead of thinking that I've got\nall this data from a big network,"},"1830":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm gonna pretend that I only\nran an experiment on those guys."},"1834":{"dur":3,"text":"And I didn't touch their friends\nwhen I ran my experiment, and"},"1837":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm gonna pretend that I only randomized\ntheir friends of friends, and"},"1840":{"dur":3,"text":"then I'm gonna use that as the variation\nthat I analyze in my experiment."},"1844":{"dur":4,"text":"So I can do that, and I can look at\nthe probability of all the different"},"1848":{"dur":3,"text":"friends of friends assignments,\nonly randomizing the auxiliary units"},"1852":{"dur":3,"text":"I can come up with a test statistic, and\nthen I can come up with a distribution"},"1855":{"dur":2,"text":"of what the test statistics\nshould be under the null."},"1857":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, have a valid hypothesis test for\nwhether friends of friends matter."},"1861":{"dur":3,"text":"And this turns out to be a very, very\ngeneral approach you can work for lots and"},"1864":{"dur":3,"text":"lots of hypotheses, you need a very good\nnetwork to get good statistical power."},"1868":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we're trying to push this forward,\nin terms of testing much more interesting"},"1872":{"dur":3,"text":"hypotheses on things like Facebook and\nso on, and network experiments."},"1876":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, so let me stop there."},"1878":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"1879":{"dur":6,"text":"[APPLAUSE]"}}
