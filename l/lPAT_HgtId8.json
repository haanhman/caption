{"4":{"dur":1,"text":"My name is Ben Alsop."},"5":{"dur":3,"text":"I am the Citi Money Gallery curator at the\nBritish Museum"},"9":{"dur":1,"text":"and welcome to my corner!"},"10":{"dur":2,"text":"I've always been interested in museums."},"12":{"dur":2,"text":"As a child I was kind of the annoying kid\nthat would want to go to a museum"},"15":{"dur":1,"text":"when I was spending time with my relatives"},"17":{"dur":1,"text":"or when I was on holiday, or a school trip."},"19":{"dur":2,"text":"And it didn't really matter what museum"},"21":{"dur":1,"text":"but I remember them having quite an affect\non me."},"23":{"dur":2,"text":"So I remember going to the Dorset Tank Museum\nand leaving there"},"25":{"dur":2,"text":"and wanting to be involved in tanks"},"28":{"dur":1,"text":"to drive a tank for instance"},"29":{"dur":2,"text":"and then I remember going to the Yelverton\nPaperweight Museum"},"31":{"dur":1,"text":"and wanting to be a paperweight."},"33":{"dur":5,"text":"But whatever the museum I went to, I really\nenjoyed the atmosphere"},"38":{"dur":1,"text":"and I never really thought I'd be a curator"},"40":{"dur":1,"text":"because I didn't even know what a curator\nwas."},"41":{"dur":3,"text":"I didn't understand the whole infrastructure\nthat goes behind a museum"},"45":{"dur":3,"text":"and luckily through volunteering, through\nstudy that I did"},"49":{"dur":2,"text":"I kind of found my way into the British Museum"},"51":{"dur":1,"text":"and I've been here for something like 8 years."},"53":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's an amazing place to work."},"55":{"dur":3,"text":"So my job here at the British Museum is as\nthe Citi Money Gallery curator."},"59":{"dur":4,"text":"Now this gallery charts over 4,500 years of\nmonetary history"},"63":{"dur":2,"text":"but also we tell a history of the world through\nmoney."},"66":{"dur":4,"text":"Now money is that great through-line through\nhistory."},"70":{"dur":2,"text":"It touches all manner of different areas of\nsociety"},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"and all 4 corners of the globe."},"74":{"dur":3,"text":"What you think about money is exactly the\nsame as what someone thought about"},"77":{"dur":4,"text":"50 years ago, 1,000 years ago, 2,000 years\nago."},"81":{"dur":1,"text":"It still consumes people in the same way"},"83":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's what I find fascinating."},"84":{"dur":3,"text":"Charting a history of money you can also see\nthe history and movement of ideas"},"88":{"dur":2,"text":"of religion, of politics."},"90":{"dur":3,"text":"You will see portraits of some of the most\nfamous and influential people in history"},"94":{"dur":4,"text":"but you will also see objects that just ordinary\npeople have been using for 4,500 years"},"99":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's what I find most fascinating I\nsuppose."},"102":{"dur":5,"text":"It's that idea that what have in the gallery\ntouches all elements of society"},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's something that you, when you enter\nthe gallery"},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"immediately have an affinity with."},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't need to know a great deal about\nthe history of money."},"113":{"dur":2,"text":"You know what money is, you know how it affects\nyou"},"115":{"dur":3,"text":"and therefore you can put yourself in the\nshoes of someone 2,000 years ago."},"119":{"dur":1,"text":"The way the Citi Money Gallery works is"},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"on one side it's how money is used by those\nin power"},"123":{"dur":2,"text":"so central banks, authorities, rulers"},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"and on the other side it's actually how money\nis used in general society"},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"because there can be a tension between those\ntwo things."},"132":{"dur":4,"text":"I particularly love the way that money is\nused once it's entered into general society,"},"136":{"dur":1,"text":"into public usage."},"137":{"dur":4,"text":"So what I want to draw your attention to is\none particular object that I find fascinating"},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"and one which through a bit of social media"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"and through trying to talk about the object\nto the general public"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"I actually found out more information than\nI knew to begin with"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"and the department knew when it came into\nthe collection."},"152":{"dur":1,"text":"So let me show you something."},"154":{"dur":6,"text":"If I show you this, which is a shilling coin\nof George V."},"161":{"dur":4,"text":"He's got a wonderfully big, bushy mustache\non one side."},"165":{"dur":1,"text":"Now if you see this as a coin that's fine"},"167":{"dur":1,"text":"but you could also see it as a canvas."},"169":{"dur":5,"text":"So you could see it as a material which you\ncan use to send a message"},"174":{"dur":4,"text":"or make an inscription, or do a design."},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's what drew me to one particular\nobject that we have."},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"What someone has done is they've taken a 1\nshilling coin"},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"and on the other side they've written a message"},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"and they've written a message of love"},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"from Fred to a lady called Nellie"},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"and they wrote this in 1916"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"and on it he's inscribed the word 'France'."},"196":{"dur":3,"text":"Now these fit into this idea of love tokens"},"199":{"dur":1,"text":"and we have a number of these in the collection"},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"and they date back to the 18th and 19th centuries"},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"when they were at their height"},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"when they were used most famously by people\nwho had"},"208":{"dur":1,"text":"been convicted of a crime"},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"and were to be sent to penal colonies in America\nor Australia"},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"for committing a crime in Britain."},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"And so they would take a coin, they would\nsmooth it down"},"216":{"dur":1,"text":"and they would put a message on it."},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"Things like 'To my loving mother, from your\nunfortunate son'"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"or 'When this you see remember me'"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"and they used it because coins are durable."},"225":{"dur":4,"text":"If you come into the Citi Money Gallery you\nwill see thousands of years worth of coins"},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"and some of them, especially the gold and\ngood quality silver"},"231":{"dur":1,"text":"look as good as they day they were made."},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"These are durable objects."},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"And often they are some of the best objects\nto tell us about society"},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"when no other objects exist."},"239":{"dur":4,"text":"So this guy Fred took a coin, smoothed down\none side"},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"and wrote a message of love."},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"Now using one of these"},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"which is a register."},"250":{"dur":5,"text":"So every objects that comes into the Museum\nis given an independent registration number"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"it's very own independent registration number."},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"Now we do it digitally, but before the dawn\nof computers"},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"if you can image such a thing"},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"we used to write it all down."},"262":{"dur":6,"text":"So this is a register and in it I'm looking\nfor a particular reference to this token that"},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"I mentioned."},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"The reference itself says very little indeed."},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"It simply says that the token came into the\nMuseum"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"presented by Mrs Carvell of Hampstead in 1966."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"Now I have no other information."},"282":{"dur":4,"text":"So I wanted to maybe find out more about who\nthis Fred and Nellie were."},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean I didn't really hold out much hope."},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"As I said we didn't really have much information\nto go on."},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"So I wrote a blog, and the blog was put up\non the British Museum website"},"295":{"dur":4,"text":"and in it I explained the coin, how it fits\ninto our wider collection,"},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"how it's on display in the Citi Money Gallery"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"and how it would be amazing if we could maybe\nfind out some more information."},"305":{"dur":4,"text":"This love token was tweeted by the British\nMuseum"},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"and it did rather well,"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"it was retweeted by Gary Kemp from Spandau\nBallet,"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"which is interesting because it's a silver\ncoin and I always thought he was more interested"},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"in gold..."},"320":{"dur":4,"text":"and then just a few weeks later the Museum\nwas contacted by a lady called Joy."},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"Now she came up with some really compelling\nevidence that suggested that the Fred and"},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"Nellie on this coin"},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"were actually her grandparents."},"331":{"dur":4,"text":"She said that they were married in 1916, her\ngrandparents Fred and Nellie,"},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"they were married actually in London."},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"He went off to fight at the Somme in 1916"},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"and fought in the First World War."},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"In 1966, which is when the token actually\ncame into the Museum's collection,"},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"so it is at this point that we record it in\na book such as this,"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"is the year that Nellie died."},"353":{"dur":5,"text":"Now we can never be certain that this is the\nFred and Nellie mentioned on the coin"},"358":{"dur":4,"text":"but rather wonderfully as well, Joy did send\na photograph of Fred and Nellie"},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"and there they are on their wedding day if\nI remember rightly."},"366":{"dur":4,"text":"And there's Fred in his uniform and there's\nNellie sitting by his side."},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"So what I particularly found fascinating about\nthis story"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"and fascinating about this object"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"is that it's taking something really every\nday"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"really utilitarian."},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a coin, they're mass-produced"},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"but they're completely changing the nature\nof it."},"382":{"dur":6,"text":"It's no longer a coin to be used in exchange,\nor trade, or to pay for something"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"it becomes a testament to two peoples' relationship"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"so an image has been removed from it"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"and on it has been inscribed this message"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"'From Fred to Nellie France 1916'"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"The words are simple, there's no great flowery\nlanguage"},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"but you know exactly what is being said."},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"And of course he is making this token"},"405":{"dur":4,"text":"not entirely sure if he will come back from\nFrance in 1916."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"It really does show that these objects which\nare"},"412":{"dur":4,"text":"kind of utilitarian and very usable and very\ndisposable to some extent"},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"can actually be fascinating"},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"and talk not of money, talk not of trade and\nexchange"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"which are obviously very important parts of\nhistory"},"425":{"dur":5,"text":"but it can also just talk about human relationships."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"So if there was a curator I'd like to swap\ncorners with"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"it would probably be my colleague Eleanor\nwho works in the Asia department."},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"She works with the Korean Gallery and it's\na gallery like the Citi Money Gallery"},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"which combines both the contemporary and the\nancient."},"443":{"dur":7,"text":"So I'd love to find out more about what she\ndoes."}}
