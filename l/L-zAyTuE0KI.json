So we\u2019re going to make some smart choices today with the snacks that we\u2019re"},"19":{"dur":3,"text":"going to do.

I\u2019m going to add three cups of dried rolled"},"47":{"dur":5,"text":"oats to my bowl and in the same bowl I\u2019m\ngoing to add seeds.

There\u2019s going to be some cinnamon in there so one teaspoon of cinnamon. You"},"61":{"dur":4,"text":"can put nutmeg in or allspice or whatever\nspice you have. Now to get this all bound"},"66":{"dur":3,"text":"nicely we\u2019re going to add three quarters\nof a cup of honey. Now I\u2019ve just softened"},"69":{"dur":3,"text":"that honey so you can see how easy it is to\njust pour. So just pop the bottle into some"},"73":{"dur":4,"text":"boiling water to let it stand or if you\u2019re\nworried about it sticking to your jug, put"},"78":{"dur":3,"text":"boiling water in your jug first, fill it, tip it out, then put the honey in, the honey"},"82":{"dur":5,"text":"just falls straight out. So much easier. I\u2019ve\nalso got some olive oil so half a cup of olive"},"87":{"dur":6,"text":"oil going in there to bind as well and vanilla. I\u2019m using vanilla extract; it\u2019s much better"},"93":{"dur":4,"text":"then vanilla essence which is kind of like\na science, science class in a bottle when"},"98":{"dur":3,"text":"you use essence.

So take a spoon and just"},"152":{"dur":5,"text":"give that a really good mix and make sure\nthat all the oats and all the seeds are completely"},"158":{"dur":4,"text":"covered with moisture, being the oil, the\nhoney and the eggs."},"162":{"dur":4,"text":"So once you get it like so \u2013 it smells nice,\nyou can smell that lovely cinnamon in there,"},"167":{"dur":5,"text":"really beautiful. Alright so easy right? Five\nminutes, not even. Take a bowl or a dish around"},"172":{"dur":4,"text":"about this size. You\u2019ll soon know when you\npush the muesli into the dish that it\u2019s"},"177":{"dur":4,"text":"going to need to be about probably one and a half to two centimetres deep. So you don't want a great big long tray"},"182":{"dur":4,"text":"make it too thin so try and restrict it to a size around about like the one I\u2019m using here."},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"It\u2019s probably around about 30 centimetres by about, probably not even that."},"190":{"dur":5,"text":"Probably say 22 centimetres long by about 12 centimetres wide. That\u2019s just me guessing."},"197":{"dur":0,"text":"Just push that in"},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"and at the moment it\u2019s a bit sloppy so what we need to do is"},"203":{"dur":5,"text":"pop that in the oven for around about 20 to 25 minutes and the oven temperature"},"208":{"dur":4,"text":"needs to be quite low though so we\u2019re only\nlooking at 150 degrees Celsius. We don't really"},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"want that to colour, we just want it to set.\nSo the eggs start to set, the coagulation"},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"happens around the oats, makes fantastic muesli bars. So I\u2019m just going to pop that in the"},"220":{"dur":3,"text":"oven, the oven is preheated to 150 degrees\nCelsius."},"226":{"dur":4,"text":"So these are out of the oven now. Just a little tip when they\u2019re in the oven just make sure"},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"they\u2019re not browning too much. If you see\na little bit around the edges, you can\u2019t"},"233":{"dur":3,"text":"help that because that\u2019s the honey caramelising but realistically this should come out almost"},"237":{"dur":4,"text":"the same as it goes in. The only difference\nis that it\u2019s set. You can feel it. When"},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"it\u2019s in the oven through it\u2019s still a\nlittle bit soft because it\u2019s still warm."},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"You have to make sure that you cool it down. So it\u2019s much better to make this early,"},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"stick it in the fridge so it can get firm\nbefore you cut it."},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"So the idea is now I\u2019m going to use a serrated edge knife so that I can cut these muesli"},"254":{"dur":5,"text":"bars nice and straight and I can saw down\nthrough those seeds as well. Now you can cut"},"260":{"dur":6,"text":"these in any sizes you want, it just depends\non the size that you\u2019d like to give and"},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"the price that you\u2019d like to charge for\nit really. Okay so look, you can see that"},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"this stays together reasonably well and it\u2019s\nlike a \u2013 my mum used to make these and we"},"274":{"dur":1,"text":"used to call them flapjacks in England, a\nlittle bit the same."},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"So what I\u2019m going to do is just pop that on the board."},"278":{"dur":7,"text":"I\u2019m going to cut that down into two pieces and just pop that on the plate so you can see how delightful they look."},"299":{"dur":7,"text":"I\u2019m going to take one of these little bars and I\u2019m just going to pop that into some wrap paper."},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"You can always take a little bit of the muesli bar out at the end as well if you wish"},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"and you can tie that with a little bit of string which makes it look quite nice as well, so."},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019ll just pop that just up on there as well so a really lovely snack, really good."},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"So very easy, takes five minutes to make, 15 to 20 minutes in the oven."},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"Make sure you make them in advance because you need to make sure they set"},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"so when you cut them up you get some nice shapes out of them as well. That one is really easy."},"352":{"dur":4,"text":"Next up I\u2019m going to do an apple and sultana muffin which is guaranteed to be a crowd pleaser."},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay so now onto our second snack, our healthy snacks,"},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"we are going to do some apple and sultana muffins you are going to really love"},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"this one it just takes one bowl, mix it up,\nput it in the oven and everybody is going"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"to love it. Okay so let\u2019s get on with these muffins."},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"We\u2019re going to take 125 grams of melted\nunsalted butter,"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"just melt it in the microwave or in a small pan."},"377":{"dur":5,"text":"We\u2019re also going to add our milk which is 200 mls of light skim milk,"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"half a cup of raw sugar,"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"Give that a little bit of a mix up first."},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"and one egg."},"400":{"dur":4,"text":"So basically all of the wet ingredients go in together with the sugar first, get that little bit mixed up."},"404":{"dur":5,"text":"Make almost like a batter, this recipe. So you add your one extra large egg."},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"The next stage is going to be adding flour\nand I do add cinnamon to this too so I normally"},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"put the cinnamon, add a couple of spoons of cinnamon, normally mix it with the flour because"},"421":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019m going to sieve the flour into this recipe.\nSieving not only will get rid of the lumps"},"426":{"dur":5,"text":"but it will also aerate this recipe. We are\nusing self raising flour anyway so we are"},"431":{"dur":5,"text":"going to get a nice light muffin. I\u2019m going\nto add this half at a time, so add half first,"},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"mix \u2013 this is where the whisk might come in handy guys. You might find that whisking"},"440":{"dur":6,"text":"that in helps you to get a nice lump free\nbatter. Yep so just gradually so maybe into"},"446":{"dur":6,"text":"two or even three goes, that way the cinnamon and the flour mix together nicely. So what"},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"you should have is a reasonably stiff batter\nat this stage."},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"Alright now right at the moment this is just\na base mixture. You could put anything into"},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"this mix, any sort of dried fruit is appropriate, any fruit, anything you\u2019d like, and today"},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019m choosing to use apples. Now apples,\ngranny smith apples are better, they\u2019re"},"469":{"dur":4,"text":"less sugar. If you\u2019re going to use a fresh\napple, peel it, core it, cut it into quarters,"},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"core it and cut it into nice reasonable size\ndice and you might need a little bit of lemon"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"juice on it if you\u2019re going to do this in\nadvance because otherwise it\u2019s going to"},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"go brown which you probably already know. Or, make it even easier, you can use canned"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"apples and they\u2019re pretty much already mushed up as well. They\u2019re supposed to be sliced"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"but in the can you\u2019ll notice that they are a little bit broken sometimes which is great"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"for this recipe. So I\u2019m going to add those.\nYou\u2019ll notice they\u2019ve been drained so"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"don't put all the liquid in from the can as\nwell and make these muffins too wet."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019m just going to add some sultanas and\nnow also this could be changed with dates"},"502":{"dur":6,"text":"or even raisins or even dried apricots, whatever you\u2019d like, pop those in as well. Then I"},"508":{"dur":5,"text":"suggest you change implements to stir this\nthrough at the end. But you stir that through,"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"so careful not to break up the apple too much because it is a little bit soft, and you can"},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"see you\u2019ve got almost just like a cake mixture here which is lovely. So just mix that through,"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"almost like fold it through really at the\nend. So the self raising flour makes sure"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"that these muffins are lovely and light as\nyou can see I\u2019ve got some that I\u2019ve made"},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"earlier, they\u2019re just beautiful and they\u2019re\nreally moist as well and that\u2019s because"},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"of the apple that\u2019s in them. It keeps its\nmoisture nicely."},"535":{"dur":4,"text":"You can use a variety of little cupcakes,\nlittle patty moulds, I chose green ones because"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"it matches the apple, you know I\u2019m all for\nthat. But I\u2019ve also got these really lovely"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"ones, they are \u2013 normally you see these\nin coffee shops. They look very glamorous."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"They really are just bits of paper folded\nup. You could make a fortune if you went into"},"550":{"dur":4,"text":"this business. You can pop those straight\ninto the muffin trays and you don't need to"},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"spray them, don't need to line them so it\nmakes them so much easier, it helps with the"},"558":{"dur":5,"text":"washing up as well. You can buy brown ones and you can also buy white but if all else"},"563":{"dur":4,"text":"fails how about just using the good old fashioned little cupcake cups, just like so."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"I\u2019ll do a couple like that just so you can see\nthe difference."},"571":{"dur":6,"text":"Alright now when you\u2019re going to use this\nmix, I would suggest two spoons and I would"},"577":{"dur":4,"text":"suggest going quite slowly because especially if you get the mixture up on the top of those"},"582":{"dur":5,"text":"muffin patty cases. So just take a spoon of\nthe mix, drop it in over the centre, and then"},"587":{"dur":6,"text":"it allows you to do that so that you don't\nspill the muffin mix anywhere else. So spoon"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"it off the other spoon, much easier. I\u2019ll\nshow you in one of these shallow ones so you"},"596":{"dur":5,"text":"can see what I\u2019m saying, and that way you\ncan control it more when it goes in. So two"},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"good spoonfuls in each one, so that\u2019s a\ngood portion control as well as a help to"},"606":{"dur":7,"text":"get it into the dish, and what we\u2019re going\nto do is just make the tops a little bit crunchy."},"614":{"dur":5,"text":"We\u2019re going to add a little bit of raw sugar,\na little bit of cinnamon and also I thought"},"619":{"dur":5,"text":"we might put some oats on the top. It makes it look really earthy, gives us another nutrient"},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"in this dish as well but it also helps to make it crunchy on the top. We all love the"},"628":{"dur":4,"text":"tops of muffins. There was a television series on about people buying just muffin tops because"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"no-one is really interested in the bottom,\nthey just like the top. So we\u2019re going to"},"636":{"dur":5,"text":"make the top really, really crunchy and very\ndecadent. Being healthy at the same time."},"643":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay now this mixture that I\u2019ve given you\nhere, this recipe will make you 12 decent"},"648":{"dur":6,"text":"size apple and sultana muffins. Just while\nyou\u2019re finishing off your little moulds"},"654":{"dur":6,"text":"here, just be mindful that you need to preheat your oven to around about 190 degrees Celsius."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"These need to go into a warmed oven and they take around about 15 to 20 minutes to cook."},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019m going to put a few little oats on the top. You don't have to do this, you can just"},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"leave them as they are but it does make it\na little bit crunchier and gives it a little"},"671":{"dur":8,"text":"bit more interest. They look nice as well.\nA little bit of brown sugar \u2013 not brown"},"680":{"dur":4,"text":"sugar, I mean raw sugar I should say, and\nlikewise you don't have to do this, I just"},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"like to do it, and I\u2019m just going to grab a little bit of cinnamon and just dust the"},"688":{"dur":5,"text":"tops with cinnamon as well. Beautiful. So you can\u2019t complain about the amount of"},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"work going into this one, it\u2019s like five minutes. It\u2019s one bowl. Yes it\u2019s a whisk"},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"and a spoon but that\u2019s it. You even don't\nhave to wash up these muffin tins, you can"},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"just wipe them out, they\u2019re fine. So easy and healthy and beautiful at the same time"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"so we\u2019re going to pop those in the oven\nand I\u2019ll be back soon."},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay so we\u2019ve got our lovely muffins out\nof the oven. They smell glorious, they\u2019re"},"713":{"dur":5,"text":"so nice. Who can resist a hot cake or muffin out of the oven? Now just to make sure that"},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"they are cooked, I\u2019ll give you a couple\nof little pointers. The first thing to do"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"is to just press the centre of the cake and\nmake sure it springs back up to the touch."},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"So in other words the mixture in the centre\nof the cake is not still wet. If it was your"},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"thumb would stay down, the thumb print would stay down in the cake, it would still be wet"},"733":{"dur":5,"text":"inside which is not good. Another thing you\ncan do is take one out of the tray and with"},"738":{"dur":5,"text":"the skewer, a wooden skewer if you can, just pop that into the cake or the muffin and remove"},"744":{"dur":5,"text":"it and it should be reasonably clean. If it\u2019s\ncovered in wet soggy mixture, chances are"},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"the cakes and muffins are still wet inside\nwhich is what we want to try and avoid it."},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"So once you\u2019re happy that they\u2019re cooked,\nthey\u2019re coloured nicely, not too dark, so"},"757":{"dur":4,"text":"around about 15 to 20 minutes, pop them onto a rack because the reason we use the rack"},"762":{"dur":4,"text":"is that we want to make sure that the air is circulating underneath. If we leave them"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"in the muffin trays then they\u2019re going to\nget a little bit soggy, a little bit damp,"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"a bit of condensation, so that\u2019s a good tip."},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"Beautiful, so there\u2019s our apple and sultana muffins ready to eat, looking great,"},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"and a nice healthy snack for your tuckshops."},"785":{"dur":5,"text":"So now we\u2019re going to do our tzatziki and\nvegetable batons or vegetable crudit\u00e9s, some"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"people might say \u2018crudites\u2019 but it\u2019s\nactually crudit\u00e9s and it sounds better, it\u2019s"},"794":{"dur":4,"text":"all in the name. So we\u2019re going to do some\nbatons of raw vegetables. I\u2019ve got capsicum,"},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"cucumber, celery and carrot to use. Then I\u2019m going to use a natural yoghurt, put some mint"},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"and lemon juice in and make a tzatziki with\na bit of garlic. So these are really healthy"},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"snacks for your tuckshop. So what I was going to do is just cut up a"},"811":{"dur":4,"text":"little bit of vegetable. And we\u2019ve got some\nnice celery there, some young celery in the"},"815":{"dur":6,"text":"inside, and I\u2019ve got some carrots here that\nI\u2019m going to cut into my batons and what"},"821":{"dur":6,"text":"I want you to do is cut your strips of carrot\nfirst, keep them nice and chunky, and what"},"828":{"dur":4,"text":"I do is cut down so that you have a base to\ncut on and then therefore the carrot is not"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"rolling all over the bench which sometimes\nis difficult to cut."},"838":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay so with this, now sometimes with a cucumber it\u2019s nice to take the seeds out. Not everybody"},"843":{"dur":5,"text":"likes the seeds. So I normally just cut the\nseeds out a little bit and cut the strips."},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"So I still leave the peel on, I don't peel it, that\u2019s a little bit more nutrients there"},"852":{"dur":5,"text":"for us but yeah, it\u2019s up to you if you want to leave the seeds in. I\u2019m using a Lebanese"},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"cucumber so that it\u2019s a little bit sweeter.\nAlternatively you could use a continental"},"862":{"dur":5,"text":"cucumber, one of the larger ones. So we want a nice bite size piece to go in this dish."},"868":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019m just going to cut my batons of carrot\nas well. Try and keep them all the same length"},"872":{"dur":4,"text":"so they look nice, nice and neat, and if you\nwant to you can pop a little bit of cherry"},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"tomato in these as well as a little crudit\u00e9s, it doesn\u2019t all have to be sticks, and you"},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"can also use some raw broccoli and raw cauliflower which is also very nutritious. People might"},"884":{"dur":4,"text":"turn their nose up at easing raw cauliflower\nbut it\u2019s actually the best way to eat it."},"889":{"dur":5,"text":"So cut it into smaller pieces for people. Okay so we\u2019ve got our carrots and our cucumber."},"894":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019m going to use a little bit of this celery\nhere and I\u2019m just going to take the younger"},"898":{"dur":4,"text":"pieces of celery, it\u2019s not nice using the\noutside celery leaves and celery stalks because"},"902":{"dur":5,"text":"they can be a little bit tough to chew.

Just add a little bit of green capsicum as well. So cut down each side when you\u2019re"},"933":{"dur":4,"text":"doing this and it leaves the centre seeds in there which is okay. If they fall out, just brush them away."},"941":{"dur":0,"text":"Perfect."},"943":{"dur":4,"text":"Alright so if you wanted to use a cup to put the crudit\u00e9s in"},"947":{"dur":3,"text":"put the tzatziki at the bottom and build the crudit\u00e9s up so every piece has a little"},"951":{"dur":4,"text":"bit on its bottom, or you can use one of your normal plastic containers with a small container"},"956":{"dur":3,"text":"for the dip. It\u2019s entirely up to you and also it depends on the type of packaging that"},"960":{"dur":4,"text":"you can get hold of.
