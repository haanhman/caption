Because, they simply could not compete"},"491":{"dur":5,"text":"with the un-level playing field, an advantage\ngiven by state law to Blue Shield. So, once"},"496":{"dur":4,"text":"Blue Shield notified the Department of its\nwithdrawal from Department of Insurance regulation"},"500":{"dur":5,"text":"of the new products sold in 2014, we told\nthem that they had a 180-day notice requirement."},"506":{"dur":5,"text":"As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, if they\nleave the market entirely (regulated by the"},"511":{"dur":4,"text":"Department of Insurance), a 90-day notice\nis insufficient.

Blue"},"591":{"dur":6,"text":"Shield agreed to mail the notices tomorrow.\nIn the notices, people are going to be told"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"that they're going to have the opportunity\nto stay in their current coverage, at their"},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"current price, with the current broader provider\nnetwork and doctors and hospitals until March"},"605":{"dur":5,"text":"31st. If all the policyholders decided to\nstay, as I said a moment ago, they would save"},"611":{"dur":5,"text":"$28.6 million. Now, why is there so much savings?\nAgain, because not only are their policies"},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"being cancelled, but they are also being told\nthat new policies they would move into, will"},"621":{"dur":6,"text":"have higher rates. And, as you know California\nlaw does not authorize the Insurance Commissioner,"},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"unfortunately, to regulate health insurance\nand HMO rates. So, these higher rates, are"},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"rates that the carriers are setting themselves\nand I don't have the ability, under state"},"636":{"dur":4,"text":"or federal law, to say they can't do. And\nwe need to change that as well."},"641":{"dur":5,"text":"Now for the existing Blue Shield customers\nwho are eligible for Federal Premium subsidies"},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"if they purchase health insurance through\nThe Exchange, we think it would make more"},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"sense for them to purchase in The Exchange\nand we would encourage them to do so. So of"},"654":{"dur":5,"text":"those 115,000 customers some number are going\nto have incomes low enough to qualify for"},"660":{"dur":4,"text":"federal premium subsidies in The Exchange.\nWe would encourage all those customers look"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"closely at The Exchange products to see if\nthey are eligible for a subsidy. Because,"},"667":{"dur":5,"text":"it may very well make sense for them to move\nright away to an Exchange product, and enjoy"},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"the benefit that subsidy all next year, as\nopposed to keeping their current policy into"},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"the first quarter of next year. And to do\nthat of course they simply have to call Covered"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"California, or go up on Covered California's\nwebsite, and take advantage of those opportunities;"},"686":{"dur":4,"text":"or, contact an agent or broker in their community;\nor talk to any of the enrollment counselors"},"691":{"dur":6,"text":"that are out there in the field. So, that\nis an option that is still available to them,"},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"and it's something that they should certainly\ntake advantage of."},"701":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, the other thing that we want to make\nsure people understand, is that this opportunity"},"707":{"dur":6,"text":"to stay in their current policy until March\n31st, ends on December 6.

But, they have to let"},"726":{"dur":4,"text":"Blue Shield know by December 6, if they want\nto take advantage of this opportunity."},"731":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, one of the other things these customers\nare going to have to weigh is whether they"},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"already expect to have health care costs early\nin 2014, that will help them and meet their"},"741":{"dur":5,"text":"deductible in 2014; versus whether it's important\nto keep a lower premium and broader provider"},"746":{"dur":4,"text":"network for the first three months of the\nyear. In other words, if these customers anticipate"},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"a major health expense in the first three\nmonths of next year, it might make more sense"},"755":{"dur":5,"text":"for them to move into new product, take advantage\nof the expenditure associated with that health"},"760":{"dur":5,"text":"expense, and the fact that that will move\ntowards meeting their deductible so then they"},"766":{"dur":5,"text":"can have additional health care coverage later\nin the year.

In"},"778":{"dur":4,"text":"the notice Blue Shield will inform policyholders\nthat if they wait to transition to a new policy"},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"in April, they'll have to meet a separate\ndeductible going forward from that point."},"786":{"dur":5,"text":"So they've got to decide when they're planning\nto incur major health care expenses, and what"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"would be best for them from an economic standpoint\nin terms beginning to spend down towards that"},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"deductible."},"797":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, for anyone in the individual market regardless\nof which health insurance you currently have"},"801":{"dur":6,"text":"coverage with, if you've received a December\n31st cancellation notice, you are going to"},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"want to find out if you're eligible for subsidies\nin The Exchange.
