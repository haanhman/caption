events?"},"32":{"dur":4,"text":"To put it in simple\nwords, what I do"},"36":{"dur":7,"text":"is create spaces that are\ndramatic and beautiful enough"},"44":{"dur":1,"text":"for a

flowers,\nbringing it to the apartment,"},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"and distributing it."},"126":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, to tell you the\ntruth, it was a nightmare."},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"I had

along."},"162":{"dur":1,"text":"Then, of course,\nthese are the '80s."},"164":{"dur":3,"text":"So the event industry was\njust getting going there."},"167":{"dur":1,"text":"There were just florists."},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"That's how I started--\njust doing flowers."},"173":{"dur":3,"text":"And then the '90s came."},"176":{"dur":4,"text":"And as far as I'm concerned,\na goddess was born."},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"A goddess by the name\nof Martha Stewart."},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"Martha taught\nAmerica and the world"},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"that it was perfectly fine\nto go into

one of\nmy first clients that came in"},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"and she said, Preston,\nlisten, I would"},"235":{"dur":5,"text":"love to create this setting that\nis so incredible that it looks"},"241":{"dur":5,"text":"like an opera set, that whenever\nmy guests walk in, they say,"},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"oh my god, this is just\nthe most incredible thing"},"249":{"dur":0,"text":"that I've ever seen."},"250":{"dur":4,"text":"You can see one of the images\nthat almost 20 years later, I"},"255":{"dur":3,"text":"think is still holds up."},"258":{"dur":5,"text":"The concept of event\ndesigning started developing."},"264":{"dur":4,"text":"Not only was it important to do\nbeautiful flowers in a table,"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"when my client walked into\na ballroom and saw a room"},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"and said, Preston,\nI hate the walls."},"274":{"dur":0,"text":"I said, no problem."},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"We can change it."},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"I hate the ceiling."},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, no problem,\nwe can change it."},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"And so emerged\nwithin my business"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"what's called event designing."},"288":{"dur":6,"text":"For us, that is translated\nin transforming a space."},"294":{"dur":4,"text":"A room that exists in a certain\nway, and each time the guests"},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"walk in, it looks different."},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"So today I have a few\nimages to show you"},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"of the concept of\ntransformation."},"306":{"dur":4,"text":"Recently, we did an\nevent, a wedding."},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"And you have to understand that\nfor transformation, there's"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"a few things that we use."},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"One of the things that\nwe use is set design."},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"Other is lighting,\nnew technology,"},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"but most importantly, flowers."},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"That is my tool."},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"The way that I design\nand create a space"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"is very heavily flowers."},"333":{"dur":0,"text":"Why?"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"If I could, I would just\ncover the world with flowers."},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"It's that simple."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"But anyhow, so this\nevent was over a pool,"},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"and it was a ceremony."},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"And the client wanted us to\ncreate this-- basically this"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"small building for her\ndaughter to get married."},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"And as you notice,\nin this section,"},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"we start creating with\nthousands of orchids,"},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"knitting them very carefully."},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"And finally, this is the\nproduct that ended up."},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you can see it\nfrom different angles."},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"This is one angle."},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"Another one."},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"And as you look closer,\nwe created this chapel"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"for the wedding\nof the gentleman."},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"Designing is about\ncreating surprises."},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"It's about creating\nelements that you walk in,"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're so in awe."},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"That is basically, I\nthink, the importance"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"of surprises in an event."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"As we move along, if\nyou notice the detail."},"394":{"dur":5,"text":"This is all crystals and\nflowers very carefully sewn in."},"399":{"dur":0,"text":"Tents."},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"I loved designing a tent."},"401":{"dur":0,"text":"Why?"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"You have this\nperfectly blank canvas"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"that you could create\nwhatever you like."},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think it's\nnot only the inside"},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"of the tent that's important."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"It's important also\nto design the outside."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"So, of course, in\nthis tent, we wanted"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"to create the feeling\nof a glass house."},"418":{"dur":4,"text":"As the guests walked in,\nthis is the interior."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"As we've been building\nit, and of course,"},"424":{"dur":5,"text":"the final project is this,\na clear looking space."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"Transforming at tent."},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"Transforming a space."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"And for the tables,\nof course, we"},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"did these tall accented pieces."},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"Another sample of\ntransformation is an event"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"that we did in the\nsouth of France"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"that we created a ballroom\nin a tennis court."},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"Ultimately the final\nproject is this."},"451":{"dur":4,"text":"And of course, creating certain\nstructure, the ceiling is open."},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"And of course, the\nsmallness of the table."},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"As we move on, we see a\nceiling transformation."},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"I did an event-- I happen\nto love French gardens"},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"by the way-- and while\ndoing this event,"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"I suggested to my\nclient that I wanted"},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"to create a [INAUDIBLE]\ngarden in the ceiling."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"And she thought I was\ncrazy, but anyhow,"},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"this is the final product."},"481":{"dur":4,"text":"It's an empty ballroom, and\nthis is the final product."},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"So what do I do?"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"What do I do?"},"489":{"dur":5,"text":"My job is to take my clients'\nfantasies and desires"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"and bring them to\nreality, as much as I can."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm not always successful, but\nI'll certainly keep trying."},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"We can see another\nform of-- of course,"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"this is all of the\ndetails of the wedding."},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"Another form of a restaurant\nis the popular Nobu Restaurant"},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"in 57th Street."},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"And they wanted to create\na winter wonderland."},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course, this\nis the final product."},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"The idea to having\nthe guests walk in"},"522":{"dur":4,"text":"and absolutely not\nrecognizing the room."},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"As we move on, events."},"530":{"dur":4,"text":"What is so unique about events?"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"I think one of the great\nthings at the moment"},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"is that there are these amazing\nartists out there, by the way."},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"They're really, really\nincredible people"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"that are creating\nincredible work"},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"that I consider to be artistic."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"But anyhow, this is\nan event that we did."},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"As a follow up, this is\na royal wedding actually"},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"that we did in the Middle\nEast where the bride very"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"dramatically walked\ndown the aisle."},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"She sits in the throne."},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the area that\nshe came out from."},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"This one, I think, is\nreally very interesting"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"because we did it\nin Jakarta, and I"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"wanted to create\na sculpture that"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"did not involve\nany flowers at all."},"574":{"dur":5,"text":"And I basically purchased\nliterally 10,000 light bulbs,"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"and anyhow, we created\nthis installation which,"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"in Chinese, means\ndouble happiness,"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"creating a dramatic statement."},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"Of course, this was for the\nparty portion of the evening."},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"As a surprise, the guests walked\nin and saw this sculpture."},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"This is an event in New York\nCity at the Waldorf Astoria,"},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"transforming the ballroom\nfrom this to this."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course the tails\nare very important."},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"The ceiling, if you see, we\ncreated this starry night."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"As we move on, this\nis a wonderful event"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"that we did that we wanted\nthe impression of moving"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"from spring to winter."},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"So as the guests walked\nin, this is what they saw."},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"As the evening progressed,\nit turned into spring."},"628":{"dur":6,"text":"Using technology, lighting,\nevery single new technology"},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"that emerged, we try to\nincorporate in creating events."},"639":{"dur":8,"text":"As we move on, so we went from\nflowers to transformation."},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's a new part\nof the business that"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"is emerging that I find that\nis incredibly interesting."},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"So a lot of clients\nand also businesses,"},"656":{"dur":4,"text":"they want to create a temporary\nstructure, just for one event."},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of times, they\ncall it pop-up place."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"They might keep\nit up for a week."},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes they'll keep\nit up for a month."},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"But there's a couple of\nstructures that we designed."},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"One of them that I\ndid, a bubble tent"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"that is the size\nof a football field"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"in the middle of the desert."},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"And as you walk in the\ntent, this is what you see."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you notice\nin this image, one"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"of the fun things\nthat I created was"},"690":{"dur":4,"text":"to create a dance floor that is\nmade out of all flowers, that"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"is covered that\npeople could dance,"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"and it basically was\nmade out of all flowers."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"This structure stayed up\nfor at least three weeks."},"703":{"dur":7,"text":"And another structure that\nwe built also is of course--"},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"and this, by the way, is at\nleast 20 to 30 feet high--"},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"so as we're building\nit of course,"},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"and then this is\nthe final product."},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the beautiful\nthings about the inside"},"722":{"dur":4,"text":"of the structure is that\nthe ceiling was retractable,"},"726":{"dur":6,"text":"meaning that at one point we had\nactually fireworks that amused"},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"and entertained the guests."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"As we move on, this\nis another section."},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"The dance was a\nlittle bit more fun."},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"I was so surprised\none day when I"},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"got a phone call and somebody\nsuggested that maybe I"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"should start doing\npublic exhibits."},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the problems\nwith the events that I"},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"do-- it's not really a\nproblem-- but one of the issues"},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"is, of course,\nthat it's only seen"},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"by a certain amount of\nguests, which is great"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"because these guests\nleave, and they"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"will carry this in\ntheir memory forever."},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"But the public exhibits\nfor the reason that I like"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"is because there's more\nthan many people that"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"comes to see it in many days."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"So this one is one that\nwe did in Los Angeles,"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"just a few orchids, not a lot."},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"And as you see, and again\nthe peacock concept took off,"},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"and we did another version\nin the south of France,"},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"and another version in\nCovent Garden in London."},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"We did move on from\npeacocks, and we"},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"created this bridal design\nat the public library"},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"at New York City."},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"And even when you\ncome into my office,"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"you see my dogs on my desk."},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"This is my desk, by the way."},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"These are the best dogs --\nyou don't have to walk them."},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"And, of course, this\nis an installation"},"817":{"dur":5,"text":"that we did in Jakarta\nwith 500,000 butterflies."},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"We created this large\nstructure in the middle--"},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"of course they weren't live,\nthese butterflies-- this is my"},"828":{"dur":0,"text":"[INAUDIBLE]."},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"So anyhow, for the\nnew year in Hong Kong,"},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"we created these installations."},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"Of course, it was\nthe year of the horse"},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"that we created\nthis installation."},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"At the moment, at the\nWynn in Las Vegas,"},"846":{"dur":4,"text":"Mr. Wynn, which as far as I'm\nconcerned is a brilliant man,"},"850":{"dur":4,"text":"had the idea of creating\nthis hot air balloon made out"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"of 100% flowers."},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"And also, he also created\na carousel made out"},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"of all flowers."},"862":{"dur":4,"text":"And of course the carousel is\nall mobile, and it goes around."},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"For me, this is an\namazing opportunity"},"870":{"dur":5,"text":"to be able to create my\nwork from florist to event"},"875":{"dur":3,"text":"design and, of course,\nnow it translate"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"into the public installation."},"881":{"dur":4,"text":"This is the most recent wedding\nthat I did for Mr. Sean Parker."},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"Mr. Sean Parker I think is\na brilliant, brilliant guy,"},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"and he just wanted to\ncreate the ultimate wedding"},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"that we had in Big Sur."},"894":{"dur":3,"text":"In Big Sur-- this is Mr.\nParker and his wife--"},"898":{"dur":5,"text":"the entire theme of the\nevent was Game of Throne."},"903":{"dur":4,"text":"The images-- everyone was\ndining outside in the park."},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"As you move along,\nthis is a night image."},"911":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the ceremony area."},"914":{"dur":3,"text":"As we move on, we see\nthem getting married."},"917":{"dur":4,"text":"So I think it's very\ntricky to do weddings"},"922":{"dur":4,"text":"outdoor, and the reason why is\nbecause it's so vast that you"},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"have to create statements that\nare so powerful that you could"},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"actually see the decor."},"933":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the traditional space."},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course, this is at night,\nthe wonderful lighting creating"},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"a fun event."},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"So what do I do?"},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"What do we do?"},"946":{"dur":6,"text":"I have a company that the\nmain purpose is to entertain."},"952":{"dur":4,"text":"The main purpose of my company\nis to get into my clients' head"},"957":{"dur":3,"text":"and truly try to\nsee what's there"},"960":{"dur":2,"text":"in order to bring\nit out for

replicate."},"1040":{"dur":4,"text":"Once we do that, then\ncomes the fantasy portion."},"1045":{"dur":4,"text":"How can we create something\nthat, either out of flowers"},"1050":{"dur":3,"text":"or of lighting, that\ntells the story,"},"1053":{"dur":3,"text":"that tells the story in\na way that it's noticed."},"1056":{"dur":3,"text":"As you notice, most of my\njob is not
