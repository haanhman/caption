that sexual assault\nis but a symptom of the problem."},"75":{"dur":3,"text":"The problem is the mindset\nof how these young men"},"78":{"dur":6,"text":"are being programmed to think about,\nto talk about, and to treat women."},"84":{"dur":1,"text":"Before I dive into the whole talk,"},"86":{"dur":2,"text":"I feel like I have to preface\na few disclaimers."},"88":{"dur":1,"text":"Number one: I'm going to mess up."},"90":{"dur":2,"text":"I just accepted\nthat that's going to happen."},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm probably going\nto blank out at some point,"},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"so please be

of humanity"},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"to better prioritize the women and girls."},"151":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, what's interesting\nis that some schools call me"},"155":{"dur":2,"text":"because, you know, at the end of the day,"},"157":{"dur":3,"text":"they care about what's going on\nin their locker rooms."},"160":{"dur":5,"text":"But before I ever started in locker rooms,\nI worked in girl

suddenly, I was that girl\nin the locker room,"},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"having tough love conversations"},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"with men about the importance\nof respecting women."},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"It probably helped that I worked\nat FOX Sports and ESPN,"},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"and that I grew up in Texas\nwhere football is a

schools were hiring me"},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"because they had an incident\ngoing on in their locker rooms,"},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"and other schools\nwere just legitimately concerned,"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"and I had one head coach call me,"},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"and he said he was worried\nbecause he had a daughter,"},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"and the way in which these young men\nwere talking about women,"},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"that was so disrespectful."},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"Sure enough, I fly out\nand I am sitting there,"},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"and halfway through my talk -"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"we're sitting in a circle in the locker,\nyou can imagine, the only girl -"},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"and halfway through my talk,"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"one of the guys\nraises his hand and he says:"},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"\"You know, I get it,\nit's important to 'respect' chicks,"},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's cool to fuck chicks.\""},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"You can imagine, the coach is like,\n\"You gotta be kidding me.\""},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"He is sitting there, shaking his head,"},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"looking down at the ground."},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, I look up at this kid,\nand I said, \"Okay, says who?\""},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"There is this long

goes by,"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"I look up and I say, \"Here is the thing,\nI am not necessarily disagreeing,"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm just saying you made\na really opinionated

yourself."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"He came up to me after the talk,\nand he gave me a really awkward hug,"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"and he said, \"Thank you,\""},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"and I looked at him,\nand I said, \"For what?\""},"370":{"dur":5,"text":"And he said, \"No one has ever\nasked me to think for myself."},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to thank you for the invitation.\""},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I have a thousand\nstories of adventures,"},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"being the only girl in the locker room."},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"I have stories that would\nmake you laugh, and make you cry,"},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"and they would make you cringe,\nand they would break your heart."},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"But more than anything else,\nthey would leave you hopeful."},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"You see, I was put on the planet\nto empower women."},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"I was made known of that\nat a really young age,"},"401":{"dur":4,"text":"but it wasn't until I stood in a room\nfull of alpha dudes that I realized"},"406":{"dur":4,"text":"that I'd been missing the point,\nonly preaching to half the sky."},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"That violence against women\nis not a women's issue,"},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"although we are incredibly\ncapable creatures."},"418":{"dur":5,"text":"Violence against women is a human issue,\nand it requires all of us participating."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"And the truth is, the majority\nof these young men"},"426":{"dur":4,"text":"feel that they have never been invited\nto sit at our table."},"432":{"dur":4,"text":"And because I'm not Santa,\nand I can't fly to every single school -"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"although Lord knows I have tried,"},"438":{"dur":6,"text":"I have spent 220 days a year\non the road for the past three years."},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we created the first ever\nProtectHer program,"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"that can be integrated\ninto college locker rooms,"},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"to invite young men to broaden\ntheir definition of manhood."},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"Because we believe that in order\nto protect the dorm rooms,"},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"that we have to activate the hearts\nand the minds of the locker rooms."},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"A few things that I have learned\nbeing in the trenches with these guys"},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"is first and foremost, we have\nto make them aware of their programming."},"472":{"dur":4,"text":"We have to get the most distracted\ngeneration in history"},"476":{"dur":5,"text":"to pause long enough to be introspective,\nto ask the hard questions: \"Says who?\""},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"We know that they consume\nten hours of media a day."},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"Media that glorifies\nviolence against women,"},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"that's inherently disrespectful,\nthat's hyper sexualizing and objectifying."},"496":{"dur":5,"text":"We know that they consume\n3,000 brand images every day,"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"spoon-feeding them a definition of manhood"},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"that's been hijacked\nby a cheap cologne-wearing Ken doll,"},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"lacking a moral constitution,\nself-respect, and authentic confidence."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"We know that the majority\nof these young men"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"learn about sex through porn."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"So, maybe we can stop being so shocked"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"because they're doing exactly\nwhat we, as a society,"},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"are programming them to do,\nand they're doing it very well."},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"So maybe, as a society,\nwe can better educate them"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"on sex and healthy relationships."},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"We need to have\na conversation about identity."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"We have to broaden\ntheir definition of manhood"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"because the consensus\nin the locker room, right now,"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"is very easy and pretty achievable."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"It's be as rich as you can,\nbe as famous as you can,"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"and bang as many girls as you can."},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, it's interesting,\nbecause my husband had a brilliant idea,"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"he said, \"What we have to do\" -"},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"and my husband is here,\nhe is a 6'9\" poster boy of feminism -"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause)"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"And his brilliant suggestion was,\n\"We have to get these young men"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"to stop viewing women\njust as sexual objects,"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"but to remind them\nthat women are human beings, too.\""},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"He said, \"So honestly, if I were you,\nI would just pull pictures"},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"of their girlfriends, and sisters,\nand moms from social media."},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd put it in your presentation.\""},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"That's my husband voice, by the way."},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"It was this brilliant idea."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"So, for the first talk\nthat I ever gave for Elite Eleven,"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"I pulled pictures\nof all the women that they love,"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"and I put up a slide, and it says,"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"\"One in four girls will be\nsexually assaulted on a college campus.\""},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course,\ntheir eyes glazed over, like,"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Here we go, we're going\nto have this conversation.\""},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"Then I click the next slide, and I said,\n\"But it's different when it's her.\""},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"And I memorized ten to fifteen names,"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"I said, \"It's different when it's Sarah,"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"and when it's Lauren,\nand when it's Jenny.\""},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"And now these guys are looking\nat their 16-year-old sister."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"Half the guys in the room started crying."},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"We have to reframe this issue"},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"to make this extremely personal to them."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"Number three, we have to have\na conversation about respect."},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"You can't give something\nthat you don't have."},"641":{"dur":4,"text":"We have to imbue these young men\nwith more self-respect,"},"645":{"dur":4,"text":"so that they're able to treat\nothers with more dignity."},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"What dawned on me was"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"that we are not teaching enough\nemotional education in school right now,"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"we are certainly not teaching\nthese young men"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"how to create an authentic confidence,"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"so they are sourcing it\nfrom exactly where they know how."},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"Through performance, through popularity,\nand through possessions."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"We have to broaden\na definition of confidence"},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"that is not contingent\non social media highlight reels"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"and external validation."},"679":{"dur":4,"text":"Number four: We have to have\nreal talk with these guys."},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"I have yet to come into a locker room"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"where they use words\nlike \"consent\" and \"bystander.\""},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"Those are words that we use,\nin our shiny star studded PSAs."},"693":{"dur":4,"text":"I have yet to hear of a guy come in,\nand raise his hand, and be like,"},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"\"There's this really great opportunity\nfor us, bystanders, to intervene.\""},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"I have never heard of a guy be like,"},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"\"We were in the middle of hooking up,\nI'm not gonna lie, I paused, I was like,"},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"'I just wanna make sure that I officially\nhave your consent moving forward.'\""},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"That's not me poking fun\nat the intention behind these words."},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"That's just we have to give them\nreal language and real tools"},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"for the moments that we\nare asking them to be brave."},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"We have to work with them,\nand be in conversation with them,"},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"to offer them language\nwhen they see something sketchy,"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"being able to say, \"Yo, we don't do that.\""},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"That in the middle of hooking up,\nto give them language like,"},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Yo, I just wanna make sure\nthat you're cool with us having sex.\""},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"Because as long as we're talking\nto them like academic robots,"},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"I think we're setting

universities"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"when this stuff happens\nin their locker room;"},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"we're at pandemic levels,\nthis is happening everywhere."},"766":{"dur":4,"text":"Instead,
