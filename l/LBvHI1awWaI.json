January 7th, 2008"},"28":{"dur":1,"text":"at three o'clock in the afternoon,"},"30":{"dur":3,"text":"in a small conference room\non the top floor of our building,"},"33":{"dur":3,"text":"the president of the company\nwanted to have a quick meeting with me,"},"36":{"dur":2,"text":"which wasn't unusual since he was my boss."},"39":{"dur":3,"text":"But the meeting turned out\nto be even more brief than expected."},"44":{"dur":1,"text":"He fired me."},"46":{"dur":6,"text":"And I'll never forget how his words\njust sucked the breath right out of me,"},"53":{"dur":3,"text":"and I left the conference room\nin a dazed state,"},"56":{"dur":4,"text":"and I went home and curled up in my bed\nin the fetal position for three hours."},"61":{"dur":3,"text":"And while I could go on\nin vivid detail about how I felt,"},"64":{"dur":3,"text":"what it did to my self-esteem,\nmy finances, and so on,"},"68":{"dur":1,"text":"what I now realize is,"},"69":{"dur":5,"text":"while that event created the greatest\namount of discomfort I had ever felt,"},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"it was that discomfort,"},"77":{"dur":2,"text":"the departure from my ordered life,"},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"that forever changed it for the better."},"83":{"dur":1,"text":"You see, friends,"},"84":{"dur":2,"text":"what makes you comfortable can ruin you,"},"87":{"dur":3,"text":"and what makes you uncomfortable\nis the only way to grow."},"91":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me say that again:"},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"What makes you comfortable can ruin you,"},"94":{"dur":4,"text":"and only in a state of discomfort,\ncan you continually grow."},"99":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I suppose if on January 8th,\nhad somebody come up and said,"},"102":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Gee buddy, getting fired is a good thing\nbecause now you're really going to grow!\""},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"I probably would have smacked them."},"108":{"dur":4,"text":"But, pretty quickly I became motivated\nto start a new journey,"},"113":{"dur":2,"text":"and after a couple years\nof work with my new team"},"115":{"dur":2,"text":"and a PhD friend\nat the University of Nebraska,"},"118":{"dur":1,"text":"we had this epiphany"},"120":{"dur":5,"text":"on how to illustrate and apply\nthe science of discomfort and growth."},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"We called the concept: the \"Growth Rings.\""},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"The Growth Rings represent\nliving environments"},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"that promote or hinder growth."},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"And that includes everything\nfrom your place of work,"},"138":{"dur":2,"text":"to even a fishbowl."},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"You see, what dictates\nthe size of a goldfish"},"143":{"dur":1,"text":"is its environment."},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"And while this goldfish\nlives in a very safe environment,"},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"it's also very limiting in most every way."},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"And when placed\nin a more robust environment,"},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"like, say, a small pond,\nthis can be the result."},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, it also means he could be eaten."},"160":{"dur":2,"text":"But friends, this is you -"},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"the environments\nin which you work, live, and play,"},"166":{"dur":3,"text":"they're all a proverbial fishbowl\nthat dictates your growth."},"171":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the first Growth Ring represents\na low-performing, low-growth environment,"},"176":{"dur":1,"text":"called stagnation."},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"Stagnation is understood\nby having to follow too many steps,"},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"and permissions, and minutiae."},"183":{"dur":4,"text":"That stifles creativity,\nindependent thought, and action."},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"To imagine an environment such as this,"},"190":{"dur":3,"text":"think no further than our state\nand federal governments."},"194":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, the antithesis\nof stagnation is chaos,"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"also low-growth and low-performing."},"200":{"dur":4,"text":"Chaos can be caused by internal\nor external events or conditions."},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"We see chaos occur at times\nin business mergers,"},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"natural disasters,\nand horrific events like 9\/11."},"211":{"dur":4,"text":"Chaos is having\nzero predictability or control"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"over inputs and outcomes."},"220":{"dur":1,"text":"Coming back down the Growth Rings,"},"221":{"dur":4,"text":"next to stagnation is\nthe most desirable environment: order."},"226":{"dur":4,"text":"Order is knowing that what you do,\nor what is happening in your environment,"},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"leads to a predictable outcome."},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"And in predictability, comfort is found."},"238":{"dur":3,"text":"But comfort is also\nwhat makes order so dangerous."},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"Because science shows that anytime\nyou continually do something,"},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"or even think about something\nthe same way,"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll eventually stop growing."},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"And this applies to every living thing -"},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"even our dog."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"You see, if Aspen had a chance,"},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"she'd choose comfort six days a week\nand twice on Sundays."},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"But too much growth-limiting order"},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"would have prevented her\nfrom becoming a therapy dog,"},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"and had this been allowed,"},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"think of the lives this gentle soul\nwould not be touching today."},"278":{"dur":5,"text":"So, before your order continues\nto limit the way you think and act,"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"remember what I said earlier:"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"Growth only occurs\nin a state of discomfort."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, think about the power of that phrase:"},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"Growth only occurs\nin a state of discomfort."},"294":{"dur":4,"text":"I can unequivocally state,\nI wouldn't be standing on this stage today"},"298":{"dur":4,"text":"without my uncomfortable,\norder-disrupting day, nine years ago -"},"304":{"dur":4,"text":"by the way I'm not recommending you go\nget fired to see if it leads to a TEDTalk."},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"When you feel discomfort hit,"},"313":{"dur":4,"text":"that means you've entered\nthe complexity ring."},"317":{"dur":4,"text":"Complexity is nothing more\nthan changed order,"},"322":{"dur":4,"text":"but when your order is changed,\noutcomes are no longer predictable,"},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"and it's unpredictability\nthat makes you uncomfortable."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"And while most times"},"333":{"dur":4,"text":"your visceral response to discomfort\nis not just \"No\" but \"Hell, no,\""},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"you can actually learn\nhow empowering it is"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"to consciously acknowledge discomfort,"},"343":{"dur":4,"text":"and then, when appropriate,\nchoose complexity over order."},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"And I know seeking discomfort sounds odd,\nand not many people do it,"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"but you have to learn to embrace it"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"because it's the only environment"},"355":{"dur":4,"text":"where sustained\nor exponential growth can occur."},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"362":{"dur":4,"text":"To weave high-growth complexity\ninto the fabric of your lives,"},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"there are three primary ways\nit can be triggered."},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"Complexity trigger number one\nis it can be forced upon you."},"376":{"dur":4,"text":"When I got fired, I didn't have\na chance to stay in order,"},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"complexity was selected for me,\nand when this happens,"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"how much you grow\ndepends on how you respond to it."},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I could have remained angry,\nI could have used it as an excuse,"},"390":{"dur":4,"text":"but what I actually learned\nis that I suck as an employee,"},"395":{"dur":5,"text":"and I'm much better off accepting\nthe risks of running my own company."},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"Complexity trigger number two:\nSomeone can help you get there."},"405":{"dur":5,"text":"This is the role of parents,\nteachers, coaches, and bosses."},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"Because left on their own,"},"413":{"dur":5,"text":"people will consciously or subconsciously\nselect the comfort of order."},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"And they then need to be\npushed into complexity"},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"in order to continue growing."},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"My youngest daughter\nspent most of her high school life"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"training to play tennis,"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"and her coach was\npretty familiar with our work"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"on complexity and the Growth Rings."},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I called him up one day\nto check on Maddie's progress,"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was able to phrase\nmy question like this, I said:"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Hey, Lee, how long has it been"},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"since Maddie's been pushed\ndeep into complexity?\""},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"Lee's response:"},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Hmm, funny you'd ask Bill.\nWe got there yesterday."},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"She broke down into tears\non the tennis court.\""},"456":{"dur":0,"text":"\"Huh.\""},"458":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, knowing how tough my daughter is,\nand the fact that she never cries,"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"told me she was deep into complexity."},"465":{"dur":5,"text":"But, friends, this is where critical\ndevelopmental decisions are made"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"because the old Bill,\nthe pre-Growth Ring Bill,"},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"would have intervened and wanted to know\nwhat was making her so uncomfortable."},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"Then I would have done everything I could\nto try and get her happy again."},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"What I really would have been doing"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"is removing the complexity,\nand putting her in order."},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"I actually would have been stifling\nher development."},"493":{"dur":5,"text":"But the new, post-Growth Ring Bill\nrelished in his daughter's discomfort."},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"500":{"dur":5,"text":"And it was the coach's next words\nthat told me everything I needed to hear."},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"He said, \"Bill, I've got to tell you,\nit took a heck of a lot more"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"to get her to the limits\nof complexity this month,"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"than it did last month.\""},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"Discomfort was causing her growth."},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, but what if you're not lucky enough"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"to live or work in a robust\nhigh-growth environment?"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"What if you're stuck in order,\neven worse, stagnation?"},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, the great news is,"},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"everyone can trigger\ncomplexity at any time."},"537":{"dur":5,"text":"So, complexity trigger number three:\nTrigger it yourself."},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"Take a journey with me\nback to Montgomery, Alabama"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"in the 1950s."},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"Imagine, if you will\na young girl, who's black,"},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"and she attends an all-black high school."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"And she takes the city bus\nto get there and home,"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"which wasn't unusual in that era."},"559":{"dur":5,"text":"And on March 2, 1955,\nshe boards a bus to come home from school,"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"and she sits near the back,"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"in the

front."},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"And according to local law"},"576":{"dur":5,"text":"she needed to move further back\nto create room for white people to sit."},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"You see, Montgomery had an order in place"},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"that when followed,\nled to a very predictable outcome:"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"repression of people with little conflict."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"But 15-year-old Claudette Colvin"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"had just spent the last month\nin high school studying black history,"},"600":{"dur":4,"text":"and she was understandably fed up\nwith the historic and existing atrocities."},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"And so on this day, she decided\nshe didn't like Montgomery's order,"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"and by refusing to give up her seat,"},"612":{"dur":5,"text":"she sent a community, our laws,\nand our entire country into complexity."},"619":{"dur":4,"text":"Yes, nine months before Rosa Parks\nmade her famous decision to stay put,"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"it was a 15-year-old girl"},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"that was handcuffed, dragged\nfrom the bus, and taken to prison."},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"It was Miss Colvin, not Rosa Parks,\nwho first fought the law,"},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"and by the way,"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"was also the star plaintiff to testify\nin the famous lawsuit"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"that went all the way\nto the US Supreme Court."},"642":{"dur":0,"text":"So,"},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"I use Claudette's actions\nnot to heighten awareness of race issues,"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"although that's not necessarily bad,"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"but I used it as an example\nof every issue,"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"of every situation\nin an ordered

book,\nsummarizes this concept very eloquently."},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"She said: \"The constant facade of order"},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"hides the wilderness that is craving\nto seep out and teach us"},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"that life wasn't created\nto be what we think it is."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"Beyond words, we must\nexperience the wilderness"},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"to be taught what

the tennis court,"},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's order you should fear the most\nbecause it is a threat."},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"And order-disrupting people"},"714":{"dur":5,"text":"like Jesus,
